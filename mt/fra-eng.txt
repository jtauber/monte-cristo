001.000 Marseille.--The arrival.
001.001 On February 24, 1815, the lookout of Notre-Dame de la Garde signaled the three-masted ship _Pharaon_, coming from Smyrna, Trieste and Naples.
001.002 As usual, a coastal pilot left the port immediately, skimmed the Château d'If, and went to board the ship between the Cape of Morgion and the island of Rion.
001.003 Immediately, as usual, the platform of Fort St. John was covered with curious onlookers; for it is always a great affair in Marseilles when a ship arrives, especially when that ship, like the _Pharaon_, has been built, rigged, and stowed in the yards of old Phocaea, and belongs to a shipowner from the city.
001.004 However, this ship was moving forward; she had fortunately crossed the strait which some volcanic tremor had dug between the island of Calasareigne and the island of Jaros; she had passed Pomègue, and she was moving forward under her three topsails, her big jib and her brigantine, but so slowly and with such a sad gait, that the curious, with that instinct which forebodes a misfortune, wondered what accident might have happened on board. Nevertheless, the experts in navigation recognized that if an accident had happened, it could not have been to the vessel itself; for she was moving forward in all the conditions of a perfectly steered ship: her anchor was at anchor, her bowsprit shrouds were unhooked; and near the pilot, who was preparing to direct the _Pharaon_ through the narrow entrance of the port of Marseilles, was a young man with a quick gesture and an active eye, who was watching every movement of the ship and repeating every order of the pilot.
001.005 The vague anxiety which hung over the crowd had particularly affected one of the spectators on the esplanade of St. John, so that he could not wait for the vessel to enter the harbor; he jumped into a small boat and ordered to row ahead of the _Pharaon_, which he reached opposite the cove of the Reserve.
001.006 When the young sailor saw this man coming, he left his post beside the pilot and came to lean against the side of the ship with his hat in his hand.
001.007 He was a young man of eighteen or twenty years of age, tall, slender, with beautiful black eyes and ebony hair; there was in his whole person that air of calm and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from childhood to struggle with danger.
001.008 "Ah, it's you, Dantes!" cried the man in the boat; "what has happened, and why is this air of sadness spread all over your ship?
001.009 -- A great misfortune, Monsieur Morrel! replied the young man, a great misfortune, especially for me: at Civita-Vecchia, we lost this brave Captain Leclère.
001.010 --And the cargo?" asked the shipowner sharply.
001.011 -- It arrived safely at the port, Mr. Morrel, and I think you will be pleased in this respect; but poor Captain Leclère....
001.012 --What has happened to him?" asked the shipowner with a visibly relieved air; "what has happened to this brave captain?
001.013 --He is dead.
001.014 --Fallen overboard?
001.015 -- No, sir; dead of a brain fever, in the midst of horrible suffering."
001.016 Then, turning to his men:
001.017 "Whoa, hey!" he said, "everyone to their stations for anchorage!"
001.018 The crew obeyed. At the same time, the eight or ten sailors who made up the crew rushed to the sheets, the others to the arms, the others to the halyards, the others to the jib halliards, and the others to the sail shrouds.
001.019 The young sailor glanced nonchalantly at this beginning of the maneuver, and, seeing that his orders were being carried out, he returned to his interlocutor.
001.020 "And how did this misfortune happen?" continued the shipowner, taking up the conversation where the young sailor had left it.
001.021 -My God, sir, in the most unexpected way: after a long conversation with the port commander, Captain Leclère left Naples in a state of great agitation; after twenty-four hours, a fever took hold of him; three days later, he was dead....
001.022 "We gave him the usual funeral, and he lies, decently wrapped in a hammock, with a thirty-six ball on his feet and one on his head, at the height of the island of El Giglio. We bring back to his widow his cross of honor and his sword. It was well worth it," continued the young man with a melancholy smile, "to wage war against the English for ten years, only to die, like everyone else, in his bed.
001.023 - "What do you expect, Mr. Edmond," said the shipowner, who seemed to be consoling himself more and more, "we are all mortal, and the old must make way for the new, otherwise there would be no advancement; and as long as you assure me that the cargo....
001.024 --Is in good condition, Mr. Morrel, I answer to you. Here is a voyage which I advise you not to discount for 25,000 francs profit."
001.025 Then, as we had just passed the round tower:
001.026 "Stow the foresails, the jib and the brigantine!" shouted the young sailor; "do penaud!"
001.027 The order was carried out with almost as much promptness as on a warship.
001.028 "Bring in and cargue everywhere!"
001.029 At the last command, all sails were lowered, and the ship moved forward in an almost insensitive manner, moving only by the impulse given.
001.030 "And now, if you want to go up, Mr. Morrel," said Dantes, seeing the impatience of the shipowner, "here is your accountant, Mr. Danglars, who is coming out of his cabin, and who will give you all the information you may desire. As for me, I must see to the anchorage and put the ship in mourning."
001.031 The shipowner was not told twice. He seized a cable thrown to him by Dantes, and with a dexterity that would have done credit to a man of the sea, he climbed the rungs nailed to the bounced side of the ship, while the latter, returning to his post as first mate, yielded the conversation to the one he had announced as Danglars, and who, coming out of his cabin, actually advanced to meet the shipowner.
001.032 The newcomer was a man of twenty-five to twenty-six years of age, of a rather dark figure, obsequious to his superiors, insolent to his subordinates: also, besides his title of accountant, which is always a reason for repulsion to the sailors, he was generally as badly seen by the crew as Edmond Dantes on the contrary was loved by them.
001.033 "Well, Mr. Morrel," said Danglars, "you know the misfortune, don't you?
001.034 --Yes, yes, poor Captain Leclère! he was a brave and honest man!
001.035 --And an excellent sailor above all, aged between the sky and the water, as befits a man in charge of the interests of a house as important as Morrel and Sons," answered Danglars.
001.036 -- But, said the shipowner, following with his eyes Dantes who was looking for his anchorage, it seems to me that there is no need to be so old a sailor as you say, Danglars, to know his trade, and here is our friend Edmond who does his, it seems to me, as a man who does not need to ask advice from anyone.
001.037 -- Yes," said Danglars, casting an oblique glance at Dantes in which a flash of hatred shone, "yes, it is young, and it doubts nothing. No sooner was the captain dead than he took command without consulting anyone, and made us lose a day and a half at Elba instead of returning directly to Marseilles.
001.038 -- As for taking command of the ship, said the shipowner, it was his duty as first mate; as for losing a day and a half on the island of Elba, he was wrong; unless the ship had some damage to repair.
001.039 - The ship was as well as I am, and as I wish you to be, Mr. Morrel; and this day and a half was lost by pure caprice, for the pleasure of going ashore, that is all.
001.040 --Dantès, said the shipowner, turning to the young man, come here.
001.041 - "Sorry, sir," said Dantes, "I'll be with you in a moment.
001.042 Then addressing the crew: "Anchor!" he said.
001.043 Immediately the anchor dropped, and the chain spun with noise. Dantes remained at his post, despite the presence of the pilot, until this last maneuver was completed; then:
001.044 "Lower the flame to half-mast, put the flag at half-mast, cross the yards!
001.045 --You see," said Danglars, "he thinks he is already a captain, on my word.
001.046 --And in fact he is, said the shipowner.
001.047 -- Yes, except for your signature and that of your partner, Mr. Morrel.
001.048 --Lady, why don't we leave him in that position? He is young, I know, but he seems to me all right for the job, and very experienced in his condition."
001.049 A cloud passed over Danglars' forehead.
001.050 "Pardon, Monsieur Morrel," said Dantes, approaching; "now that the ship is anchored, I am all yours: you called me, I believe?"
001.051 Danglars took a step back.
001.052 "I wanted to ask you why you stopped at Elba?
001.053 --I don't know, sir; it was to fulfill a last order from Captain Leclère, who, on dying, had given me a package for the Grand Marshal Bertrand.
001.054 -Did you see him, Edmond?
001.055 --Who?
001.056 -The Grand Marshal?
001.057 --Yes."
001.058 Morrel looked around, and pulled Dantes aside.
001.059 "And how is the Emperor?" he asked sharply.
001.060 --Good, as far as I could tell with my eyes.
001.061 --So you saw the Emperor too?
001.062 --He entered the Marshal's house while I was there.
001.063 --And you spoke to him?
001.064 --That is to say, it was he who spoke to me, sir," said Dantes, smiling.
001.065 --And what did he tell you?
001.066 -- He asked me questions about the ship, about the time of its departure for Marseilles, about the route it had taken, and about the cargo it carried. I believe that if it had been empty, and that I had been the master, his intention would have been to buy it; but I told him that I was only a mere second in command, and that the ship belonged to the house of Morrel et fils. Ah! ah!" he said, "I know it. The Morrels are shipowners from father to son, and there was a Morrel who served in the same regiment as I did when I was in garrison at Valence."
001.067 --That's pardonable truth!" cried the shipowner joyfully; "it was Policar Morrel, my uncle, who became captain. Dantes, you will tell my uncle that the Emperor has remembered him, and you will see him cry, the old grunt. Come, come," continued the shipowner, knocking amicably on the young man's shoulder, "you did well, Dantes, to follow Captain Leclère's instructions and to stop at the Isle of Elba, although, if it were known that you had given a package to the marshal and spoken with the Emperor, that might compromise you.
001.068 --What do you want that to compromise me, sir?" said Dantes: "I don't even know what I was carrying, and the Emperor only asked me the questions he would have asked the first person. But, pardon me," resumed Dantes, "here are the health and customs officials who are coming to us; you will allow me, won't you?
001.069 - Do, do, my dear Dantes."
001.070 The young man moved away, and, as he moved away, Danglars came closer.
001.071 "Well," he asked, "it seems that he has given you good reasons for his anchorage at Porto Ferrajo?
001.072 -Excellent, my dear Mr. Danglars.
001.073 --Ah, so much the better, replied the latter, for it is always painful to see a comrade who does not do his duty.
001.074 --Dantès did his, replied the shipowner, and there is nothing to say. It was Captain Leclère who had ordered this break.
001.075 -- About Captain Leclère, did he not give you a letter from him?
001.076 --Who?
001.077 --Dantès.
001.078 -- Not to me! Did he have one?
001.079 -- I thought that in addition to the package, Captain Leclère had entrusted him with a letter.
001.080 -What package do you mean, Danglars?
001.081 --But the one that Dantes dropped off as he passed through Porto-Ferrajo?
001.082 --How do you know that he had a package to drop off at Porto Ferrajo?"
001.083 Danglars blushed.
001.084 "I was passing in front of the captain's door, which was ajar, and I saw him hand this package and this letter to Dantes.
001.085 --He didn't tell me about it," said the shipowner; "but if he has this letter, he will give it to me."
001.086 Danglars thought for a moment.
001.087 "Then, Monsieur Morrel, I beg you," he said, "do not speak of this to Dantes; I will be mistaken."
001.088 At this moment the young man returned; Danglars moved away.
001.089 "Well, my dear Dantes, are you free?" asked the shipowner.
001.090 --Yes, sir.
001.091 --It was not long.
001.092 --No, I gave the customs officers the list of goods; and as for the consignment, they had sent a man with the coastal pilot to whom I gave our papers.
001.093 --So you have nothing more to do here?"
001.094 Dantes cast a quick glance around him.
001.095 "No, everything is in order," he said.
001.096 --Then you can come and dine with us?
001.097 --Excuse me, Mr. Morrel, excuse me, please, but I owe my first visit to my father. I am no less grateful for the honor you have done me.
001.098 - It is right, Dantes, it is right. I know you are a good son.
001.099 --And... asked Dantes with some hesitation, and is he well, that you know, Father?
001.100 --But I think so, my dear Edmund, though I have not seen him.
001.101 --Yes, he keeps himself locked up in his little room.
001.102 --That at least proves that he has not lacked anything during your absence."
001.103 Dantes smiled.
001.104 "My father is proud, sir, and, had he lacked everything, I doubt he would have asked anything of anyone in the world except God.
001.105 -- Well, after this first visit, we are counting on you.
001.106 -- Excuse me again, Mr. Morrel, but after this first visit, I have a second that is no less dear to my heart.
001.107 --Ah, that's true, Dantes; I forgot that there is someone in the Catalans who must be waiting for you with no less impatience than your father: it's the beautiful Mercédès."
001.108 Dantes smiled.
001.109 "Ah! ah!" said the shipowner, "it no longer surprises me that she has come three times to ask me about the _Pharaon_. Pest! Edmond, you are not to be pitied, and you have a pretty mistress there!
001.110 --She is not my mistress, sir, said the young sailor gravely: she is my fiancée.
001.111 -Sometimes it is all one, said the shipowner, laughing.
001.112 - "Not for us, sir," replied Dantes.
001.113 - "Let's go, let's go, my dear Edmond," continued the shipowner, "don't let me keep you; you have done my business well enough for me to give you all the time you need to do yours. Do you need money?
001.114 -- No, sir; I have all my wages for the voyage, that is, nearly three months' pay.
001.115 --You are a tidy fellow, Edmund.
001.116 --Add that I have a poor father, Mr. Morrel.
001.117 --Yes, yes, I know you are a good son. Go and see your father: I have a son too, and I would be very angry at anyone who, after a three-month journey, would keep him away from me.
001.118 --Will you allow me then?" said the young man, bowing.
001.119 --Yes, if you have nothing more to say to me.
001.120 --No.
001.121 --Didn't Captain Leclère, when he died, give you a letter for me?
001.122 -- It would have been impossible for him to write, sir; but that reminds me that I will have a fortnight's leave to ask you.
001.123 -To get married?
001.124 -First, and then to go to Paris.
001.125 -Good, good! You may take as long as you like, Dantes; it will take us six weeks to unload the ship, and we will hardly set sail again for three months.... Only, in three months, you must be here. The Pharaoh," continued the owner, tapping the young sailor on the shoulder, "could not leave without her captain.
001.126 - "Without her captain!" exclaimed Dantes, his eyes shining with joy; "pay close attention to what you say, sir, for you have just answered the most secret hopes of my heart. Is it your intention to appoint me captain of the Pharaoh?
001.127 -If I were alone, I would hold out my hand to you, my dear Dantes, and say, "It is done." But I have a partner, and you know the Italian proverb: _Che a compagne a padrone_. But at least half the job is done, since you already have one of the two votes. Rely on me to get the other, and I will do my best.
001.128 --Oh, Mr. Morrel," cried the young sailor, grasping the shipowner's hands with tears in his eyes, "Mr. Morrel, I thank you in the name of my father and Mercedes.
001.129 - Well, well, well, Edmund, there is a God in heaven for good people, what the hell! Go and see your father, go and see Mercedes, and then come back to me.
001.130 --But you don't want me to take you ashore?
001.131 -- No, thank you; I'll stay and settle my accounts with Danglars. Were you pleased with him during the voyage?
001.132 --That is according to the meaning you attach to the question, sir. If it is as a good comrade, no, for I think he has not liked me since the day when I had the stupidity, following a little quarrel we had together, to propose that we stop for ten minutes at the island of Monte Cristo to settle this quarrel; a proposal which I was wrong to make to him, and which he was right to refuse. If it is as an accountant that you are asking me this question, I believe that there is nothing to say and that you will be satisfied with the way in which his work is done.
001.133 --But, asked the shipowner, "Let's see, Dantes, if you were captain of the Pharaoh, would you keep Danglars with pleasure?
001.134 --Captain or first mate, Monsieur Morrel, replied Dantes, I will always have the greatest regard for those who possess the confidence of my shipowners.
001.135 - Well, well, Dantes, I see that in every way you are a good boy. Let me not detain you any longer: go, for I see that you are on pins and needles.
001.136 --So I have my leave? asked Dantes.
001.137 -- Go, I say.
001.138 --May I take your boat?
001.139 --Take it.
001.140 --Bye, Mr. Morrel, and a thousand thanks.
001.141 --Bye, my dear Edmond, good luck!"
001.142 The young sailor jumped into the boat, went to sit at the stern, and gave the order to land at the Canebière. Two sailors immediately bent over their oars, and the boat glided as quickly as it was possible to do so, amidst the thousand boats that obstructed the sort of narrow street that leads, between two rows of ships, from the entrance to the port to the Quai d'Orléans.
001.143 The shipowner followed him with his eyes, smiling, to the edge, saw him leap over the flagstones of the quay, and lose himself at once in the midst of the variegated crowd which, from five o'clock in the morning to nine o'clock in the evening, crowds this famous street of the Canebière, of which the modern Phocaeans are so proud, that they say with the greatest seriousness in the world and with that accent which gives so much character to what they say: "If Paris had the Canebière, Paris would be a little Marseille."
001.144 Turning, the shipowner saw behind him Danglars, who, in appearance, seemed to be waiting for his orders, but who, in reality, was following the young sailor with his eyes as he did.
001.145 Only, there was a great difference in the expression of this double glance which followed the same man.
002.000 The father and the son.
002. 001 Let us leave Danglars, struggling with the genius of hatred, to try to breathe against his comrade some malignant supposition in the ear of the shipowner, and let us follow Dantes, who, after having traversed the Canebière in all its length, takes the rue de Noailles, enters a small house located on the left side of the Allées de Meilhan, climbs briskly the four floors of an obscure staircase, and, holding on to the banister with one hand, compressing with the other the beating of his heart, stops in front of a door that lets see to the bottom of a small room.
002.002 This room was the one where Dantes' father lived.
002.003 The news of the arrival of the _Pharaoh_ had not yet reached the old man, who was busy, mounted on a chair, to trellis with a trembling hand some nasturtiums mixed with clematis, which were climbing along the trellis of his window.
002.004 Suddenly he felt himself taken in hand, and a well-known voice cried out behind him:
002.005 "My father, my good father!"
002.006 The old man gave a cry and turned around; then, seeing his son, he let himself go into his arms, all trembling and pale.
002.007 "What's the matter, Father?" cried the worried young man; "are you sick?
002.008 -- No, no, my dear Edmund, my son, my child, no; but I was not expecting you, and the joy, the amazement of seeing you again so unexpectedly... my God! it seems to me that I am going to die!
002.009 -- Well, get over it, Father! They always say that joy doesn't hurt, and that's why I came in here without preparation. Let's see, smile at me, instead of looking at me as you do, with lost eyes. I am coming back and we are going to be happy.
002.010 --Ah, so much the better, boy!" said the old man, "but how are we going to be happy? Let's see, tell me about your happiness.
002.011 -- May the Lord forgive me, said the young man, for rejoicing in a happiness made with the mourning of a family! But God knows that I would not have wished for this happiness; it is coming, and I do not have the strength to grieve over it: the brave Captain Leclère is dead, father, and it is probable that, through the protection of M. Morrel, I will have his place. Do you understand, father? captain at twenty! with a hundred louis in salary and a share in the profits! isn't that more than a poor sailor like me could really hope for?
002.012 -- Yes, my son, yes, indeed," said the old man, "it is fortunate.
002.013 --And I want you to have a small house with a garden to plant your clematis, your nasturtiums and your honeysuckles with the first money I receive.... But, what's the matter with you, father, you seem to be in a bad way?
002.014 --Patience, patience! it will be nothing."
002.015 And, the old man's strength failing him, he fell backwards.
002.016 "Let's see! Let's see!" said the young man, "a glass of wine, father; that will revive you; where do you put your wine?
002.017 --No, thank you, don't look for it; I don't need it, said the old man trying to hold back his son.
002.018 --So done, so done, father, show me the place."
002.019 And he opened two or three cabinets.
002.020 "It's no use..." said the old man, "there's no more wine.
002.021 - "How, there's no more wine!" said Dantes, turning pale and looking alternately at the old man's pale, hollow cheeks and the empty cupboards, "how, there's no more wine! Have you run out of money, Father?
002.022 -- I have not lacked anything, since here you are, said the old man.
002.023 -- However, stammered Dantes, wiping the sweat from his forehead, I left you two hundred francs three months ago when I left.
002.024 --Yes, yes, Edmond, that is true; but you had forgotten when you left a small debt to the neighbor Caderousse; he reminded me of it, telling me that if I did not pay for you he would go and be paid by M. Morrel. Then, you understand, for fear that that would harm you....
002.025 --Well?
002.026 -- Well, I paid.
002.027 --But, cried Dantes, it was one hundred and forty francs that I owed to Caderousse!
002.028 --Yes, stammered the old man.
002.029 --And you gave them out of the two hundred francs I had left you?"
002.030 The old man nodded.
002.031 "So that you have lived three months with sixty francs!" murmured the young man.
002.032 --You know how little I need, said the old man.
002.033 --Oh, my God, my God, forgive me!" cried Edmund, throwing himself on his knees before the good man.
002.034 -- What are you doing?
002.035 -- Oh, you have torn my heart.
002.036 --Bah! there you are, said the old man smiling; now all is forgotten, because all is well.
002.037 --Yes, here I am, said the young man, here I am with a fine future and a little money. Here, father," he said, "take, take, and send for something at once."
002.038 And he emptied his pockets on the table, which contained a dozen gold coins, five or six five-franc ecus, and some small change.
002.039 Old Dantes' face blossomed.
002.040 "Whose?" he said.
002.041 -But, to me!... to you!... to us!... Take, buy provisions, be happy, tomorrow there are others.
002.042 --Slowly, slowly, said the old man, smiling; with your permission, I will use the purse moderately: one would think, if one saw me buying too many things at once, that I was obliged to wait for the return to buy them.
002.043 -Do as you please; but, before anything else, take a servant, father; I don't want you to stay alone. I have some contraband coffee and excellent tobacco in a small chest in the hold; you will have it tomorrow. But hush! here is someone.
002.044 - It's Caderousse, who will have learned of your arrival, and who has no doubt come to pay you his welcome-back compliment.
002.045 -Well, again lips that say one thing while the heart thinks another, murmured Edmond; but, no matter, it is a neighbor who did us a favor in the past, let him be welcome."
002.046 Indeed, just as Edmond finished the sentence in a low voice, the black, bearded head of Caderousse appeared framed by the landing door. It was a man of twenty-five to twenty-six years of age; he held in his hand a piece of cloth, which in his capacity as tailor he was about to change into a lapel.
002.047 "Hey! So you're back, Edmond?" he said with a pronounced Marseilles accent and a broad smile that revealed his ivory-white teeth.
002.048 --As you see, neighbor Caderousse, and ready to be agreeable to you in any way, replied Dantes, badly concealing his coldness under this offer of service.
002.049 --Thank you, thank you; fortunately, I have no need of anything, and it is even sometimes the others who have need of me. (Dantes made a movement.) I am not saying this for you, boy; I lent you money, you gave it back to me; that is done between good neighbors, and we are even.
002.050 -- One is never even with those who have obliged us, said Dantes, for when one no longer owes them money, one owes them gratitude.
002.051 --What's the use of talking about that! What is past is past. Let us speak of your happy return, boy. I had gone like this to the port to collect brown cloth, when I met friend Danglars.
002.052 "--You, in Marseille?
002.053 "--Yes, just the same," he answered.
002.054 "--I thought you were in Smyrna.
002.055 "--I could be there, for I have just returned.
002.056 "--And Edmond, where is he, the little one?
002.057 "--But at his father's house, no doubt," replied Danglars; "and then I came," continued Caderousse, "to have the pleasure of shaking hands with a friend.
002.058 --The good Caderousse, said the old man, he loves us so much.
002.059 --Certainly I love you, and I still esteem you, since honest people are rare! But it seems that you are becoming rich, boy?" continued the tailor, casting an oblique glance at the handful of gold and silver that Dantes had placed on the table.
002.060 The young man noticed the flash of lust that lit up the dark eyes of his neighbor.
002.061 "Eh! my God!" he said carelessly, "that money is not mine; I was showing the father the fear that he had missed something in my absence, and to reassure me, he emptied his purse on the table. Come, father," continued Dantes, "put this money back into your piggy bank; unless the neighbor Caderousse needs it in his turn, in which case it is well at his service.
002.062 --No, boy, said Caderousse, I have no need of anything, and, thank God, the state feeds its man. Keep your money, keep it: one never has too much; which does not prevent me from being obliged to you for your offer as if I were profiting from it.
002.063 --It was with good heart, said Dantes.
002.064 -- I don't doubt it. Well, here you are at your best with M. Morrel, cuddly as you are?
002.065 --Mr. Morrel has always been very kind to me, answered Dantes.
002.066 -- In this case, you are wrong to refuse his dinner.
002.067 --What do you mean by refusing his dinner?" continued old Dantes; "So he had invited you to dinner?
002.068 --Yes, my father," said Edmund, smiling at the astonishment caused to his father by the excess of honor with which he was treated.
002.069 --And why did you refuse, son?
002.070 --To come back to you sooner, father," replied the young man; "I was anxious to see you.
002.071 --That will have upset him, this good Mr. Morrel, Caderousse continued; and when one aims at being a captain, it is a mistake to upset one's shipowner.
002.072 -- I explained to him the cause of my refusal," continued Dantes, "and he understood it, I hope.
002.073 -- Ah, it is that, to be a captain, one must flatter one's bosses a little.
002.074 -- I hope to be a captain without that, replied Dantes.
002.075 --So much the better, so much the better! It will please all the old friends, and I know someone over there, behind the citadel of Saint-Nicolas, who will not be angry about it.
002.076 --Mercedes? said the old man.
002.077 --Yes, father," said Dantes, "and with permission, now that I have seen you, now that I know that you are well and have everything you need, I will ask your permission to go and visit the Catalans.
002.078 -- Go, my child," said old Dantes, "and may God bless you in your wife as he has blessed me in my son.
002.079 --His wife! said Caderousse; how you go, Father Dantes! she is not yet, it seems to me!
002.080 --No; but, in all probability," replied Edmond, "she will soon become one.
002.081 --No matter, no matter, said Caderousse, you did well to hurry, boy.
002.082 --Why is that?
002.083 --Because the Mercedes is a beautiful girl, and beautiful girls are not lacking in lovers; this one especially, they follow her by the dozen.
002.084 --Really, said Edmond with a smile under which a slight shade of concern was visible.
002.085 --Oh! yes, Caderousse continued, and even beautiful parties; but, you understand, you are going to be a captain, they will not refuse you!
002.086 --That means," said Dantes, with a smile that did not hide his anxiety, "that if I were not a captain ....
002.087 --Eh! eh! said Caderousse.
002.088 --All right, all right, said the young man, I have a better opinion than you of women in general, and of Mercedes in particular, and, I am convinced, whether I am captain or not, she will remain faithful to me.
002.089 --All the better! All the better! said Caderousse, it is always a good thing, when one is going to get married, to have faith, but, no matter; believe me, boy, do not lose time in going to announce your arrival to her and in telling her of your hopes.
002.090 --I'm going," said Edmund.
002.091 He kissed his father, waved to Caderousse and went out. Caderousse remained a moment longer; then, taking leave of old Dantes, he went down in his turn and joined Danglars, who was waiting for him at the corner of the Rue Senac.
002.092 --Well, said Danglars, have you seen him?
002.093 --I am leaving him, said Caderousse.
002.094 --And did he tell you of his hope of becoming captain?
002.095 -- He speaks of it as if he were already one.
002.096 --Patience! said Danglars, he is rushing a little too much, it seems to me.
002.097 --Dame! It seems that the thing is promised to him by M. Morrel.
002.098 -So he is quite happy?
002.099 --That is to say, he is insolent about it; he has already made me his offers of service as if he were a great personage; he has offered to lend me money as if he were a banker.
002.100 --And you refused?
002.101 --Perfectly; although I could well have accepted, since I was the one who put the first white coins he handled into his hand. But now M. Dantes will not need anyone, he is going to be a captain.
002.102 --Bah! said Danglars, he is not yet.
002.103 --My goodness, it would be well done if he were not, said Caderousse, or else there would be no way of speaking to him.
002.104 --That if we want it well, said Danglars, he will remain what he is, and perhaps even become less than he is.
002.105 --What do you say?
002.106 --Nothing, I'm talking to myself. And he is still in love with the beautiful Catalan?
002.107 --In love crazy. He went there; but either I am very much mistaken, or he will have trouble on that side.
002.108 --Explain yourself.
002.109 --What for?
002.110 --It's more important than you think. You don't like Dantes, do you?
002.111 --I don't like arrogant people.
002.112 -- Well, then! tell me what you know about the Catalan.
002.113 -- I don't know anything positive; only that I have seen things which make me believe, as I told you, that the future captain will have trouble in the vicinity of the Old Infirmary Road.
002.114 -- What did you see?
002.115 -- Well, I saw that every time Mercedes comes to town, she comes accompanied by a tall Catalan fellow with a black eye, red skin, very brown, very fiery, and whom she calls _my_ cousin.
002.116 --Ah, really! And do you think this cousin is courting her?
002.117 --I suppose so: what on earth can a tall boy of twenty-one do to a beautiful girl of seventeen?
002.118 --And you say that Dantes went to the Catalans?
002.119 -- He left before me.
002.120 --If we were going the same way, we would stop at the Reserve, and, while drinking a glass of wine from La Malgue, we would wait for news.
002.121 --And who will give us news?
002.122 --We will be on the road, and we will see on Dantes' face what will have happened.
002.123 --Come on, said Caderousse; but it is you who pays?
002.124 - "Certainly," replied Danglars.
002.125 And the two of them moved with rapid steps toward the place indicated. When they arrived there, they had a bottle and two glasses brought to them. Father Pamphile had just seen Dantes pass by not ten minutes ago. Certain that Dantes was at the Catalans, they sat down under the budding foliage of the plane and sycamore trees, in whose branches a cheerful flock of birds were singing on one of the first fine days of spring.
003.000 The Catalans.
003.001 A hundred steps away from the place where the two friends, with their eyes on the horizon and their ears to the watch, were sipping the sparkling wine of La Malgue, stood the village of Les Catalans, behind a bare hillock eaten away by the sun and the mistral.
003.002 One day, a mysterious colony left Spain and came to the spit of land where it is still today. They arrived from who knows where and spoke an unknown language. One of the chiefs, who heard Provençal, asked the commune of Marseille to give them this bare and arid promontory, on which they had just, like the ancient sailors, drawn their ships. The request was granted, and three months later, around the twelve or fifteen ships that had brought these bohemians of the sea, a small village was built.
003.003 This village, built in a strange and picturesque way, half Moorish, half Spanish, is the one we see today inhabited by descendants of these men, who speak the language of their fathers. For three or four centuries, they have remained faithful to this small promontory, on which they had flocked, like a flock of sea birds, without mixing in any way with the population of Marseilles, marrying among themselves, and having preserved the customs and the costume of their mother country, as they have preserved its language.
003.004 It is necessary that our readers follow us through the only street of this small village, and enter with us in one of these houses to which the sun gave, outside, this beautiful color dead leaf particular to the monuments of the country, and, inside, a layer of whitewash, this white tint which forms the only ornament of the Spanish posadas.
003. 005 A beautiful young girl with hair black as jet, with the velvety eyes like those of the gazelle, held upright, leaned against a partition, and crumpled between her slender fingers and of an antique drawing an innocent heather of which she tore off the flowers, and of which the debris already littered the ground; in addition, her arms naked up to the elbow, her burnished arms, but which seemed modelled on those of the Venus of Arles, quivered of a kind of feverish impatience, and she struck the ground of her flexible and arched foot, so that one glimpsed the pure, proud and bold shape of her leg, imprisoned in a red cotton stocking with grey and blue corners.
003.006 To three steps of her, sat on a chair which it balanced of a jerky movement, leaning its elbow to an old piece of furniture vermoulu, a large boy of twenty to twenty-two years looked at her of an air where fought the concern and the spite; its eyes questioned, but the firm and fixed glance of the girl dominated its interlocutor.
003.007 "Let's see, Mercedes," said the young man, "here is Easter which is going to return, it is the moment to make a wedding, answer me!
003.008 --I have answered you a hundred times, Ferdinand, and you must really be an enemy of yourself to question me again!
003.009 -- Well, repeat it again, I beg you, repeat it again so that I will believe it. Tell me for the hundredth time that you refuse my love, which your mother approved; make me understand that you are playing with my happiness, that my life and my death are nothing to you. Ah, my God, my God! to have dreamed ten years of being your husband, Mercedes, and to lose this hope which was the only goal of my life!
003.010 -I never encouraged you in this hope, Ferdinand, replied Mercedes; you have not a single coquetry to reproach me with. I have always said to you, "I love you as a brother, but never demand anything from me but this brotherly friendship, for my heart belongs to another." Have I always said this to you, Fernand?
003.011 --Yes, I know it well, Mercedes," replied the young man; "yes, you have given yourself the cruel merit of frankness towards me; but have you forgotten that it is a sacred law among the Catalans to marry among themselves?
003.012 -- You are mistaken, Fernand, it is not a law, it is a habit, that is all; and, believe me, do not invoke this habit in your favor. You have fallen into the conscription, Fernand; the freedom you are allowed is a mere tolerance; from one moment to the next you may be called up for service. Once you are a soldier, what will you do with me, that is to say, with a poor orphan girl, sad, without any fortune, whose only property is an almost ruined shack, where a few worn-out nets hang, a miserable inheritance left by my father to my mother and by my mother to me? Since she died a year ago, think, Fernand, that I have been living almost on public charity! Sometimes you pretend that I am useful to you, and that for the right to share your pocket with me; and I accept, Fernand, because you are the son of one of my father's brothers, because we were brought up together, and above all because it would be too painful for you if I refused you. But I do feel that this fish that I am going to sell and from which I get the money with which I buy the hemp that I spin, I do feel, Fernand, that it is a charity.
003.013 -- And what does it matter, Mercedes, if, poor and isolated as you are, you suit me better than the daughter of the proudest shipowner or the richest banker in Marseille! What do we need? An honest woman and a good housewife. Where could I find better than you in these two respects?
003.014 --Fernand, Mercédès replied, shaking her head, one becomes a bad housewife and cannot answer for remaining an honest woman when one loves another man than one's husband. Be content with my friendship, for, I repeat, that is all I can promise you, and I promise only what I am sure I can give.
003.015 --Yes, I understand," said Ferdinand; "you bear your misery patiently, but you are afraid of mine. Well, Mercedes, loved by you, I will try my luck; you will bring me luck, and I will become rich: I can extend my state as a fisherman; I can enter as a clerk in a trading post; I can become a merchant myself!
003.016 -- You can't try any of that, Fernand; you're a soldier, and if you stay in the Catalans, it's because there's no war. So remain a fisherman; do not dream dreams that would make reality seem even more terrible, and be content with my friendship, since I cannot give you anything else.
003.017 -- Well, you are right, Mercedes, I will be a sailor; I will have, instead of the costume of our fathers which you despise, a varnished hat, a striped shirt and a blue jacket with anchors on the buttons. Is this not the way to be dressed to please you?
003.018 --What do you mean?" asked Mercedes with an imperious look, "what do you mean? I don't understand you.
003.019 -- I mean, Mercedes, that you are only so hard and cruel to me because you are waiting for someone who is dressed like that. But the one you are waiting for may be fickle, and if he is not, the sea is fickle for him.
003.020 --Fernand, cried Mercédès, I thought you were good and I was wrong! Fernand, you are a bad heart to call upon the wrath of God to help your jealousy! Well, yes, I don't hide from it, I wait for and love the one you say, and if he doesn't come back, instead of accusing this inconstancy that you invoke, you, I will say that he died loving me."
003.021 The young Catalan made a gesture of rage.
003.022 "I understand you, Fernand: you will blame him for the fact that I do not love you; you will cross your Catalan knife against his dagger! What good will that do you? To lose my friendship if you are defeated, to see my friendship turn into hatred if you are victorious. Believe me, to quarrel with a man is a bad way to please the woman who loves that man. No, Ferdinand, you will not let yourself go to your evil thoughts. Not being able to have me for a wife, you will be content to have me for a friend and a sister; and besides," she added, her eyes troubled and wet with tears, "wait, wait, Fernand: you said it just now, the sea is treacherous, and it is already four months since he left; for four months I have counted many storms!"
003.023 Fernand remained impassive; he did not try to wipe away the tears that rolled down Mercedes' cheeks; and yet, for each of these tears, he would have given a glass of his blood; but these tears were flowing for another.
003.024 He got up, went around the cabin and came back, stopped in front of Mercedes, his eyes dark and his fists clenched.
003.025 "Let's see, Mercedes," he said, "once again answer: is it well resolved?
003.026 --I love Edmond Dantes, said the girl coldly, and no one but Edmond will be my husband.
003.027 --And you will always love him?
003.028 --As long as I live."
003.029 Fernand lowered his head like a discouraged man, heaved a sigh that sounded like a groan; then suddenly raising his forehead, his teeth clenched and his nostrils half-open:
003.030 "But if he is dead?
003.031 -If he is dead, I will die.
003.032 --But what if he forgets you?
003.033 --Mercedes!" shouted a joyful voice from outside the house, "Mercedes!
003.034 --Ah!" cried the girl, blushing with joy and leaping with love, "you see that he has not forgotten me, for here he is!
003.035 And she rushed to the door, which she opened with a shout:
003.036 "To me, Edmond! Here I am."
003.037 Fernand, pale and trembling, recoiled backwards as a traveler does at the sight of a snake, and meeting his chair, fell back into it seated.
003.038 Edmond and Mercédès were in each other's arms. The burning sun of Marseilles, which penetrated through the opening of the door, flooded them with a flood of light. At first they saw nothing of their surroundings. An immense happiness isolated them from the world, and they spoke only in those interspersed words which are the outbursts of a joy so lively that they seem to be the expression of pain.
003.039 Suddenly Edmond saw the dark figure of Fernand, who was looming in the shadows, pale and threatening; by a movement of which he did not realize himself, the young Catalan held his hand on the knife passed at his belt.
003.040 "Ah! pardon," said Dantes, frowning in his turn, "I had not noticed that there were three of us."
003.041 Then, turning to Mercedes:
003.042 "Who is this gentleman?" he asked.
003.043 --Monsieur will be your best friend, Dantes, for he is my friend, he is my cousin, he is my brother; he is Fernand; that is to say, the man whom, after you, Edmond, I love most in the world; do you not recognize him?
003.044 --Ah, yes, I do," said Edmund.
003.045 And, without abandoning Mercedes, whose hand he held tightly in one of his, he held out his other hand to the Catalan with a movement of cordiality.
003.046 But Fernand, far from responding to this friendly gesture, remained mute and motionless as a statue.
003.047 Then Edmund looked from Mercédès, moved and trembling, to Fernand, dark and threatening.
003.048 This one look taught him everything.
003.049 Anger rose to her forehead.
003.050 "I didn't know how to come to you in such a hurry, Mercedes, to find an enemy.
003.051 -An enemy!" cried Mercedes with a look of wrath at her cousin; "an enemy in my house, you say, Edmund! If I believed that, I would take you under my arm and go to Marseilles, leaving the house never to return."
003.052 Fernand's eye flashed.
003.053 "And if anything should happen to you, my Edmond," she continued with the same implacable phlegm that proved to Fernand that the girl had read the depths of his sinister thought, "if anything should happen to you, I would climb the Cape of Morgion, and throw myself headlong on the rocks."
003.054 Fernand turned frightfully pale.
003.055 "But you are mistaken, Edmond," she continued, "you have no enemy here; there is only Fernand, my brother, who will shake hands with you as with a devoted friend."
003.056 And at these words the girl fixed her imperious face on the Catalan, who, as if fascinated by this look, slowly approached Edmond and held out his hand.
003.057 His hatred, like an impotent wave, though furious, came to break against the ascendancy that this woman exercised over him.
003.058 But no sooner had he touched Edmond's hand than he felt that he had done all he could do, and he rushed out of the house.
003.059 "Oh!" he cried, running like a fool, drowning his hands in his hair, "oh! who will deliver me from this man? Woe is me! Woe is me!
003.060 --Eh! the Catalan! eh! Fernand! Where are you going?" said a voice.
003.061 The young man stopped short, looked around, and saw Caderousse sitting with Danglars under a cradle of foliage.
003.062 "Eh!" said Caderousse, "why don't you come? Are you in such a hurry that you don't have time to say hello to your friends?
003.063 --Specially when they still have an almost full bottle in front of them," added Danglars.
003.064 Fernand looked at the two men with a dazed air, and answered nothing.
003.065 "He seems all sheepish," said Danglars, pushing Caderousse with his knee: "are we mistaken, and that, contrary to what we had foreseen, Dantes would triumph?
003.066 --Dame! one must see," said Caderousse.
003.067 And turning to the young man:
003.068 "Well, let's see, Catalan, have you made up your mind?" he said.
003.069 Fernand wiped the sweat that trickled from his forehead and entered slowly under the arbour, whose shade seemed to restore a little calm to his senses and the coolness a little well-being to his exhausted body.
003.070 "Hello," he said, "you called me, didn't you?"
003.071 And he fell rather than sat down on one of the seats that surrounded the table.
003.072 "I called you because you were running around like a madman, and I was afraid you were going to throw yourself into the sea," laughed Caderousse. What the hell, when you have friends, it's not only to offer them a glass of wine, but also to prevent them from drinking three or four pints of water."
003.073 Fernand gave a groan that sounded like a sob and let his head fall on his two wrists, which were placed crosswise on the table.
003.074 "Well, do you want me to tell you, Fernand," Caderousse resumed, beginning the conversation with that coarse brutality of common people to whom curiosity makes one forget all diplomacy; "well, you look like a discomfited lover!"
003.075 And he accompanied this joke with a big laugh.
003.076 "Bah!" replied Danglars, "a boy cut like that is not made to be unhappy in love; you are making fun, Caderousse.
003.077 --Not so, said the latter; listen rather as he sighs. Come, come, Fernand," said Caderousse, "raise your nose and answer us: it is not nice not to answer friends who ask us about our health.
003.078 --My health is fine, said Fernand, clenching his fists but not raising his head.
003.079 --Ah! do you see, Danglars, said Caderousse, winking at his friend, here is the thing: Fernand, whom you see, and who is a good and brave Catalan, one of the best fishermen in Marseilles, is in love with a beautiful girl called Mercédès; but unfortunately it seems that the beautiful girl, on her side, is in love with the second in command of the _Pharaon_; and, as the _Pharaon_ entered the port today, do you understand?
003.080 -- No, I do not understand, said Danglars.
003.081 -- Poor Fernand will have received his leave, Caderousse continued.
003.082 --Well, then? said Fernand, raising his head and looking at Caderousse, like a man who is looking for someone on whom to vent his anger; Mercédès depends on no one? is she not? and she is quite free to love whom she wishes.
003.083 --Ah! if you take it like that, says Caderousse, that is something else! I thought you were a Catalan; and I had been told that the Catalans were not men who let themselves be supplanted by a rival; they had even added that Fernand especially was terrible in his revenge."
003.084 Fernand smiled with pity.
003.085 "A lover is never terrible," he said.
003.086 -The poor boy!" said Danglars, pretending to pity the young man from the depths of his heart. What do you want? He did not expect to see Dantes suddenly come back like this; perhaps he thought him dead, unfaithful, who knows? These things are all the more sensitive because they happen to us suddenly.
003.087 --Ah, my goodness, in any case, said Caderousse, who was drinking as he spoke and on whom La Malgue's smoky wine was beginning to have its effect, in any case, Fernand is not the only one who is upset by the happy arrival of Dantes, is he, Danglars?
003.088 -- No, you are right, and I would almost dare to say that it will bring him bad luck.
003.089 --But never mind, Caderousse resumed, pouring Fernand a glass of wine, and filling his own glass for the eighth or tenth time, while Danglars had hardly touched his; never mind, in the meantime he is marrying Mercédès, the beautiful Mercédès; he is coming back for that, at least."
003.090 Meanwhile, Danglars enveloped with a piercing glance the young man, on whose heart Caderousse's words fell like molten lead.
003.091 "And when is the wedding?" he asked.
003.092 --Oh! it is not yet done!" murmured Fernand.
003.093 --No, but it will be done, said Caderousse, as true as Dantes will be the captain of the _Pharaon_, will it not, Danglars?"
003.094 Danglars flinched at this unexpected blow, and turned back to Caderousse, whose face he in turn studied to see if the blow was premeditated; but he read nothing but envy on that face already almost dazed by drunkenness.
003.095 "Well," he said, filling the glasses, "let us drink to Captain Edmond Dantes, husband of the beautiful Catalan!"
003.096 Caderousse brought his glass to his mouth with a weighed-down hand and swallowed it in one gulp. Fernand took his and smashed it against the ground.
003.097 "Eh! eh! eh!" said Caderousse, "what do I see over there, at the top of the hillock, in the direction of the Catalans? Look, Fernand, you have a better view than I have; I think I am beginning to see things in a cloudy way, and, as you know, wine is a traitor: it looks like two lovers walking side by side and hand in hand. God forgive me! they do not suspect that we see them, and here they are kissing!"
003.098 Danglars did not lose one of Fernand's anxieties, whose face was decomposing at sight.
003.099 "Do you know them, Monsieur Fernand?" he said.
003.100 --Yes," replied the latter in a dull voice, "it's Mr. Edmond and Miss Mercedes.
003.101 --Ah! you see! said Caderousse, and I did not recognize them! Ahoy! Dantes! ahoy! the beautiful girl! come over here a little, and tell us when the wedding is, for here is M. Fernand who is so stubborn that he does not want to tell us.
003.102 --Will you be quiet! said Danglars, pretending to hold back Caderousse, who, with the tenacity of drunkards, was leaning out of the cradle; try to stand upright and let the lovers love each other quietly. Here, look at Mr. Fernand, and take an example: he is reasonable, him."
003.103 Perhaps Fernand, pushed to the limit, prodded by Danglars like the bull by the banderilleros, was at last going to spring up, for he had already risen and seemed to be gathering on himself to pounce on his rival; but Mercédès, laughing and upright, raised her beautiful head and shone her clear gaze; then Fernand remembered the threat she had made, to die if Edmond died, and he fell back quite dejectedly on his seat.
003.104 Danglars looked successively at these two men: one stunned by drunkenness, the other dominated by love.
003.105 "I shall get nothing out of these fools," he murmured, "and I am very much afraid to be here between a drunkard and a poltroon: here is an envious man who is intoxicated with wine, while he should be intoxicated with gall; here is a great fool who has just had his mistress taken from under his nose, and who is content to cry and complain like a child. And yet, it has you eyes blazing like those Spaniards, those Sicilians and those Calabrians, who take revenge so well; it has you fists to crush an ox's head as surely as a butcher's mace would. Decidedly, Edmond's destiny prevails; he will marry the beautiful girl, he will be a captain, and he will laugh at us; unless... a livid smile came over Danglars' lips--unless I interfere, he added.
003.106 --Hello!" continued Caderousse, half-raised and with his fists on the table, "hello! Edmond! Don't you see your friends, or are you already too proud to speak to them?
003.107 -- No, my dear Caderousse, replied Dantès, I am not proud, but I am happy, and happiness blinds, I believe, even more than pride.
003.108 -- That's a good explanation, said Caderousse. Eh! good morning, Madame Dantes."
003.109 Mercedes saluted gravely.
003.110 "That is not yet my name," she said, "and in my country it is bad luck, they say, to call girls by the name of their fiancé before that fiancé is their husband; so call me Mercédès, I pray you.
003.111 --You must forgive him, this good neighbor Caderousse, said Dantes, he is mistaken in so little!
003.112 --So, the wedding is going to take place incessantly, Monsieur Dantès? said Danglars, greeting the two young men.
003.113 --As soon as possible, Monsieur Danglars; today all the agreements at Papa Dantes', and tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, at the latest, the engagement dinner, here at the Reserve. The friends will be there, I hope; that is to say that you are invited, Monsieur Danglars; that is to say that you are in, Caderousse.
003.114 --And Fernand," said Caderousse, laughing with a pasty laugh, "is Fernand in it too?
003.115 -- "My wife's brother is my brother," said Edmond, "and we would see him with deep regret, Mercédès and I, depart from us at such a moment."
003.116 Fernand opened his mouth to reply; but the voice expired in his throat, and he could not articulate a word.
003.117 "Today the agreements, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow the engagement... hell, you're in a hurry, Captain.
003.118 --Danglars," Edmond continued, smiling, "I will tell you what Mercedes said earlier to Caderousse: don't give me the title that doesn't suit me yet, it would bring me bad luck.
003.119 --Pardon, replied Danglars; I was simply saying that you seemed to be in a hurry; what the hell! we have time: the _Pharaon_ will hardly set sail again before three months.
003.120 -- One is always in a hurry to be happy, Monsieur Danglars, for when one has suffered for a long time it is very difficult to believe in happiness. But it is not selfishness alone that makes me act: I must go to Paris.
003.121 --Ah, really! to Paris: and is this the first time you have been there, Dantes?
003.122 --Yes.
003.123 --You have business there?
003.124 -- Not on my account: a last commission from our poor Captain Leclère to be fulfilled; you understand, Danglars, it is sacred. Besides, rest assured, I will only take the time to go and return.
003.125 -- "Yes, yes, I understand," said Danglars aloud.
003.126 Then low:
003.127 "To Paris, to deliver to his address, no doubt, the letter that the Grand Marshal gave him. By Jove, this letter gives me an idea, an excellent idea! Ah, Dantes, my friend, you are not yet listed in the register of the _Pharaon_ under number 1."
003.128 Then turning to Edmond, who was already walking away:
003.129 "Bon voyage!" he shouted to him.
003.130 --Thank you," replied Edmond, turning his head and accompanying this movement with a friendly gesture.
003.131 Then the two lovers continued their road, calm and joyful like two chosen ones who go up to heaven.
004.000 Plot.
004.001 Danglars followed Edmond and Mercédès with his eyes until the two lovers had disappeared at one of the corners of Fort Saint-Nicolas; then, turning around, he saw Fernand, who had fallen back into his chair, pale and quivering, while Caderousse stammered the words of a drinking song.
004.002 "Ah, my dear sir," said Danglars to Fernand, "here is a marriage which does not seem to me to make everyone happy!
004.003 --It makes me despair, said Fernand.
004.004 --So you loved Mercedes?
004.005 -- I adored her!
004.006 --For a long time?
004.007 --Since we met, I have always loved her.
004.008 --And here you are tearing your hair out, instead of looking for a remedy! What the hell! I didn't believe that this was how people of your nation acted.
004.009 -- What do you want me to do?
004.010 -- And what do I know? Is that my business? It's not me, it seems to me, who is in love with Miss Mercedes, but you. Seek, says the Gospel, and you will find.
004.011 -- I had already found.
004.012 --What?
004.013 -- I wanted to stab the man, but the woman told me that if anything happened to her fiancé, she would kill herself.
004.014 --Bah! one says these things, but one does not do them.
004.015 --You don't know Mercedes, sir: from the moment she threatened, she would execute.
004.016 --Imbecile!" murmured Danglars: "Whether she kills herself or not, what does it matter to me, provided that Dantes is not a captain?
004.017 -- And before Mercedes dies," continued Fernand, with an accent of immutable resolution, "I myself will die.
004.018 -- Here is love! said Caderousse in a voice that was becoming more and more avuncular; here it is, or I don't know anything about it!
004.019 --Let us see, said Danglars, you seem to me a nice boy, and I would like, the devil take me! to get you out of trouble; but ....
004.020 -- Yes, said Caderousse, let us see.
004.021 -My dear, said Danglars, you are three-quarters drunk: finish the bottle, and you will be quite so. Drink, and do not meddle with what we do: for what we do one must have all one's head.
004.022 -Me drunk? said Caderousse, let's go! I would drink four more of your bottles, which are no bigger than bottles of cologne! Father Pamphile, wine!"
004.023 And to join the proof to the proposal, Caderousse knocked with his glass on the table.
004.024 "You were saying, then, sir?" resumed Fernand, eagerly awaiting the continuation of the interrupted sentence.
004.025 --What was I saying? I don't remember. That drunkard Caderousse made me lose my train of thought.
004.026 -- Drunkard as much as you want; too bad for those who fear wine, it is that they have some bad thought that they fear that wine pulls from their heart."
004.027 And Caderousse began to sing the last two lines of a song that was very much in vogue at that time:
004.028 _All the wicked are drinkers of water. This is well proven by the flood.
004.029 "You said, sir," Fernand resumed, "that you would like to get me out of trouble; but," you added ....
004.030 --Yes, but," I added, "to get you out of trouble it is enough that Dantes does not marry the one you love, and the marriage may very well fail, it seems to me, without Dantes dying.
004.031 -- Only death will separate them, said Fernand.
004.032 --You reason like a shell, my friend, said Caderousse, and here is Danglars, who is a shrewd man, a clever man, a Greek, who will prove you wrong. Prove, Danglars. I have answered for you. Tell him that there is no need for Dantes to die; besides, it would be unfortunate if he died, Dantes. He is a good boy, I love him, Dantes. To your health, Dantes."
004.033 Fernand got up impatiently.
004.034 "Let him say," said Danglars, restraining the young man, "and besides, drunk as he is, he is not making so great a mistake. Absence disjoins everything as well as death; and suppose that between Edmond and Mercedes there are the walls of a prison, they will be separated neither more nor less than if there were the stone of a tomb.
004.035 --Yes, but one comes out of prison, said Caderousse, who with the remains of his intelligence clung to the conversation, and when one has come out of prison and is called Edmond Dantes, one takes revenge.
004.036 -- What does it matter!" murmured Fernand.
004.037 -- Besides," Caderousse continued, "why should Dantes be put in prison? He has neither stolen, nor killed, nor murdered.
004.038 -Shut up, said Danglars.
004.039 -- I don't want to keep quiet, said Caderousse. I want to be told why Dantes should be put in prison. I love Dantes. To your health, Dantes!"
004.040 And he swallowed another glass of wine. Danglars followed the progress of the drunkenness in the tailor's sluggish eyes, and turning to Fernand:
004.041 "Well, do you understand," he said, "that there is no need to kill him?
004.042 --No, certainly, if, as you said just now, we had the means to have Dantes arrested. But do you have this means?
004.043 -- "If we look hard enough," said Danglars, "we might find it. But he continued, "What on earth am I going to do here?
004.044 --I don't know if it's any of your business, said Fernand, seizing his arm; but what I do know is that you have some particular reason for hatred of Dantes: he who hates himself is not mistaken in the feelings of others.
004.045 - Me, any grounds for hatred against Dantes? None, on my word. I have seen you unhappy and your misfortune has interested me, that is all; but from the moment you believe that I am acting on my own account, farewell, my dear friend, get out of this as you can."
004.046 And Danglars pretended to rise in his turn.
004.047 "Not so," said Fernand, holding him back, "stay! It matters little to me, in the end, whether you are angry with Dantes or not: I am angry with him; I confess it highly. Find a way and I will carry it out, provided that no man is killed, for Mercédès said she would kill herself if Dantes were killed."
004.048 Caderousse, who had dropped his head on the table raised his forehead, and looking at Fernand and Danglars with heavy, dazed eyes:
004.049 "Kill Dantes!" he said, "who is talking here about killing Dantes? I don't want him killed: he is my friend; he offered this morning to share his money with me, as I shared mine with him: I don't want Dantes killed.
004.050 --And who is talking to you about killing him, you fool!" said Danglars; "it is a simple joke; drink to his health," he added, filling Caderousse's glass, "and leave us alone.
004.051 --Yes, yes, to the health of Dantes! said Caderousse, emptying his glass, to his health!... to his health!... there!
004.052 --But the way, the way? said Fernand.
004.053 -- So you haven't found it yet?
004.054 -- No, you've taken care of that.
004.055 --That's true, said Danglars, the French have this superiority over the Spaniards, that the Spaniards ruminate and the French invent.
004.056 --Invent then, said Fernand impatiently.
004.057 --Boy, said Danglars, a quill, ink and paper!
004.058 ---A pen, ink and paper!" murmured Fernand.
004.059 --Yes, I am an accountant: pen, ink, and paper are my instruments; and without my instruments I can do nothing.
004.060 --A pen, ink and paper!
004.061 --There is what you want on this table, said the boy, pointing to the objects you asked for.
004.062 --Give them to us then."
004.063 The boy took the paper, ink, and quill, and laid them on the crib table.
004.064 "When one thinks," said Caderousse, dropping his hand on the paper, "that there is here enough to kill a man more surely than if one were waiting for him at the corner of a wood to murder him! I have always been more afraid of a pen, a bottle of ink and a sheet of paper than of a sword or a gun.
004.065 -The funny man is not yet so drunk as he looks, said Danglars; pour him a drink, Fernand."
004.066 Fernand filled Caderousse's glass, and the latter, true drinker that he was, raised his hand from the paper and brought it to his glass.
004.067 The Catalan followed the movement until Caderousse, almost defeated by this new attack, rested or rather let his glass fall back on the table.
004.068 "Well?" said the Catalan, seeing that the rest of Caderousse's reason was beginning to disappear under this last glass of wine.
004.069 --Well, I was saying, for example," resumed Danglars, "that if, after a journey like the one Dantes has just made, and in which he touched Naples and the island of Elba, someone denounced him to the king's prosecutor as a Bonapartist agent....
004.070 -- I will denounce him! said the young man sharply.
004.071 -- Yes; but then you are made to sign your declaration, you are confronted with the one you denounced: I provide you with enough to support your accusation, I know it well; but Dantes cannot remain eternally in prison, one day or another he comes out of it, and, this day when he comes out of it, woe betide the one who made him enter it!
004.072 --Oh! I ask only one thing, said Fernand, that he should come to quarrel with me!
004.073 -- Yes, and Mercedes! Mercédès, who hates you if you only have the misfortune to skin her beloved Edmond!
004.074 --That's right, said Fernand.
004.075 --No, no," resumed Danglars, "if one were to decide on such a thing, you see, it would be much better to simply take this pen, as I am doing, dip it in ink, and write with the left hand, so that the handwriting would not be recognized, a little denunciation thus conceived."
004.076 And Danglars, joining example to precept, wrote with his left hand and in a reversed handwriting, which had no analogy with his usual handwriting, the following lines which he passed to Fernand, and which Fernand read half aloud:
004.077 _Monsieur le procureur du roi est prévenu, par un ami du trône et de la religion, que le nommé Edmond Dantès, second in command of the ship the_ Pharaon, _arrived this morning from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been charged, by Murat, with a letter for the usurper, and, by the usurper, with a letter for the Bonapartist committee of Paris_.
004.078 _We will have the proof of his crime by arresting him, because we will find this letter either on him, or at his father's house, or in his cabin on board the_ Pharaon.
004.079 "That's right," continued Danglars; "so your revenge would have common sense, for in no way then could it fall on you, and the thing would go by itself; there would be nothing left to do but to fold this letter, as I am doing, and write on it: 'To Monsieur le Procureur royal.' Everything would be said."
004.080 And Danglars wrote the address playfully.
004.081 "Yes, everything would be said," cried Caderousse, who by a last effort of intelligence had followed the reading, and who understood instinctively all that such a denunciation might entail of misfortune; "yes, everything would be said: only, it would be infamy."
004.082 And he stretched out his arm to take the letter.
004.083 "Also," said Danglars, pushing it out of his hand, "also, what I say and what I say and what I do is in jest; and, the first, I would be very angry if anything happened to Dantes, this good Dantes! Also, here..."
004.084 He took the letter, crumpled it in his hands, and threw it into a corner of the arbor.
004.085 "That's right," said Caderousse, "Dantes is my friend, and I don't want anyone to hurt him.
004.086 --Eh! who the hell is thinking of hurting him! it is neither me nor Fernand!" said Danglars, rising and looking at the young man who had remained seated, but whose oblique eye was brooding over the denunciatory paper thrown in a corner.
004.087 --In this case, Caderousse continued, let us have some wine: I want to drink to the health of Edmond and the beautiful Mercédès.
004.088 --You have already drunk too much, drunkard, said Danglars, and if you continue you will be obliged to sleep here, since you will not be able to stand on your legs.
004.089 -Me, said Caderousse, rising with the fatuity of a drunken man; me, not being able to stand on my legs! I bet that I go up to the bell tower of Accoules, and without swinging again!
004.090 -- Well, so be it, said Danglars, I bet, but for tomorrow: today it is time to go back; so give me your arm and let's go back.
004.091 --Let's go back, said Caderousse, but I don't need your arm for that. Are you coming, Fernand? Are you going back with us to Marseilles?
004.092 -- No, said Fernand, I'm going back to the Catalans.
004.093 --You are wrong, come with us to Marseille, come.
004.094 -- I have no need in Marseilles, and I don't want to go there.
004.095 -- How did you say that? You don't want to, my good man! Well, at your ease! freedom for everyone! Come, Danglars, and let monsieur return to the Catalans, since he wants to."
004.096 Danglars took advantage of this moment of good will on the part of Caderousse to lead him to the side of Marseilles; only, to open a shorter and easier way to Fernand, instead of returning by the quay of the Rive-Neuve, he came back by the door of Saint-Victor.
004.097 Caderousse followed him, all staggering, clinging to his arm.
004.098 When he had taken about twenty steps, Danglars turned around and saw Fernand rush for the paper, which he put in his pocket; then immediately, dashing out of the arbour, the young man turned toward the Pillon.
004.099 "Well, what is he doing?" said Caderousse, "he lied to us: he said he was going to the Catalans, and he is going to the city! Whoa! Fernand! You are mistaken, my boy!
004.100 -It is you who see trouble, said Danglars, he follows straight on the path of the Old Infirmaries.
004.101 --In truth! said Caderousse, well, I would have sworn that it turned to the right; decidedly the wine is a traitor.
004.102 --All right, all right, murmured Danglars, I believe that now the thing is well launched, and that there is nothing more to do than to let it work all alone."
005.000 The engagement dinner.
005.001 The next day was a beautiful day. The sun rose pure and brilliant, and the first rays of a crimson red diprised with their rubies the foamy points of the waves.
005.002 The meal had been prepared on the second floor of this same Reserve, with the arbour of which we have already met. It was a big room illuminated by five or six windows, above each one of which (explain the phenomenon that can!) was written the name of one of the big cities of France.
005.003 A wooden balustrade, like the rest of the building, reigned all along these windows.
005.004 Although the meal was indicated only for midday, from eleven o'clock in the morning, this balustrade was loaded with impatient walkers. They were the privileged sailors of the _Pharaon_ and some soldiers, friends of Dantes. All had, to do honor to the engaged ones, made see the day to their most beautiful dresses.
005.005 It was rumored among the future guests that the shipowners of the Pharaoh were to honor the wedding feast of their first mate with their presence; but this was such a great honor for Dantes that no one dared believe it.
005.006 However, Danglars, on arriving with Caderousse, confirmed this news in his turn. He had seen M. Morrel himself in the morning, and M. Morrel had told him that he would come to dinner at the Reserve.
005.007 Indeed, a moment after them, M. Morrel in turn made his entrance into the room and was greeted by the sailors of the _Pharaon_ with a unanimous cheer of applause. The presence of the shipowner was for them the confirmation of the rumor that Dantes would be appointed captain; and as Dantes was much loved on board, these good people thus thanked the shipowner for the fact that once by chance his choice was in harmony with their wishes. No sooner had M. Morrel entered than Danglars and Caderousse were unanimously dispatched to the bridegroom: their mission was to warn him of the arrival of the important person whose sight had produced such a keen sensation, and to tell him to make haste.
005.008 Danglars and Caderousse left while running but they had not made one hundred steps, that with the height of the store with powder they saw the small troop which came.
005.009 This little troop consisted of four young girls who were friends of Mercedes and Catalans like her, and who accompanied the bride to whom Edmond gave his arm. Near the future walked Father Dantes, and behind them came Fernand with his evil smile.
005.010 Neither Mercédès nor Edmond saw this evil smile of Fernand. The poor children were so happy that they saw only themselves and this beautiful pure sky which blessed them.
005.011 Danglars and Caderousse carried out their mission as ambassadors; then after exchanging a very vigorous and friendly handshake with Edmond, they went, Danglars taking his place near Fernand, Caderousse lining up beside Father Dantes, the center of general attention.
005.012 This old man was dressed in his beautiful pinned taffeta habit, adorned with large steel buttons, cut with facets. His spindly, but nervous legs, opened out in splendid cotton stockings speckled, which smelled of English contraband by a league. To his three-horned hat hung a stream of white and blue ribbons.
005.013 Finally, he leaned on a twisted wooden stick curved at the top like an antique pedum. One looked like one of these muscadins who paraded in 1796 in the newly reopened gardens of Luxembourg and Tuileries.
005.014 Near him, as we have said, Caderousse had slipped in, Caderousse whom the hope of a good meal had completed reconciling with the Dantes, Caderousse to whom there remained in the memory a vague recollection of what had happened the day before, as when one wakes up in the morning one finds in one's mind the shadow of the dream one has had during sleep.
005.015 Danglars, while approaching Fernand, had thrown on the disappointed lover a deep glance. Fernand, walking behind the future spouses, completely forgotten by Mercédès, who in this youthful and charming egoism of love had eyes only for her Edmond. Fernand was pale, then red in sudden flushes that disappeared to make way each time for a growing pallor. From time to time, he looked towards Marseille, and then a nervous and involuntary trembling made his limbs shiver. Fernand seemed to be awaiting or at least anticipating some great event.
005.016 Dantes was simply dressed. Belonging to the merchant navy, he had a suit of clothes which held the middle between the military uniform and the civilian costume; and under this suit, his good appearance, which was further enhanced by the joy and beauty of his fiancée, was perfect.
005.017 Mercédès was beautiful like one of these Greek women of Cyprus or Céos, with eyes of ebony and lips of coral. She walked with this free and frank step of which the Arlesians and the Andalusians walk. A city girl might have tried to hide her joy under a veil or at least under the velvet of her eyelids, but Mercedes smiled and looked at all those around her, and her smile and her look said as frankly as her words could have said: "If you are my friends, rejoice with me, for, in truth, I am very happy!
005.018 As soon as the bride and groom and those who accompanied them were in sight of the Reservation, Mr. Morrel disembarked and advanced to meet them, followed by the sailors and soldiers with whom he had stayed, and to whom he had renewed the promise already made to Dantes that he would succeed Captain Leclère. Seeing him coming, Edmond left the arm of his fiancée and passed it under that of Mr. Morrel. The shipowner and the young girl then set the example by climbing first the wooden staircase which led to the room where dinner was served, and which screamed for five minutes under the heavy footsteps of the guests.
005.019 "Father," said Mercedes, stopping in the middle of the table, "you on my right, please; as for my left, I'll put him there who served me as brother," she said with a gentleness that penetrated to the depths of Ferdinand's heart like a stab.
005.020 His lips turned pale, and under the bistre tint of his male face one could see once again the blood withdrawing little by little to flow to the heart.
005.021 During this time, Dantes had carried out the same maneuver; on his right he had put M. Morrel, on his left Danglars; then of the hand he had made sign with each one to place itself with his imagination.
005. 022 Already ran around the table the sausages of Arles with the brown flesh and the accentuated smoke, the lobsters with the dazzling armour, the prayres with the pink shell, the sea urchins, which seem chestnuts surrounded by their prickly envelope, the clovisses, which have the pretention to replace with superiority, for the gourmets of the South, the oysters of North; finally all these delicate appetizers that the wave rolls on its sandy bank, and that the grateful fishermen designate under the generic name of seafood.
005.023 "A beautiful silence!" said the old man, savoring a glass of wine as yellow as topaz, which Father Pamphile himself had just brought before Mercedes. One would say that there are thirty people here who only want to laugh.
005.024 --A husband is not always gay, said Caderousse.
005.025 --The fact is, says Dantes, that I am too happy at the moment to be gay. If that is how you understand it, neighbor, you are right! Joy sometimes has a strange effect; it oppresses like pain."
005.026 Danglars observed Fernand, whose impressionable nature absorbed and returned every emotion.
005.027 "Come now," he said, "would you fear anything? It seems to me, on the contrary, that everything goes according to your wishes!
005.028 --And it is precisely this that frightens me," said Dantes, "it seems to me that man is not made to be so easily happy! Happiness is like those palaces of the enchanted islands whose doors are guarded by dragons. One must fight to conquer it, and I, in truth, do not know in what way I have deserved the happiness of being the husband of Mercedes.
005.029 --Husband, husband," said Caderousse, laughing, "not yet, my captain; try a little to be a husband, and you will see how you will be received!"
005.030 Mercédès blushed. Fernand tormented himself in his chair, flinched at the slightest noise, and from time to time wiped away large patches of sweat that beaded on his forehead, like the first drops of a rainstorm.
005.031 "My goodness," said Dantes, "neighboring Caderousse, there is no need to deny me for so little. Mercédès is not yet my wife, it is true... (he pulled out his watch). But, in an hour and a half she will be!"
005.032 Everyone gave a cry of surprise, except Father Dantes, whose broad laugh showed his still beautiful teeth. Mercédès smiled and did not blush any more. Ferdinand grasped the handle of his knife convulsively.
005.033 "In an hour!" said Danglars, turning pale himself; "and how is that?
005.034 --Yes, my friends," replied Dantes, "thanks to the credit of M. Morrel, the man after my father to whom I owe the most in the world, all difficulties have been ironed out. We bought the banns, and at half past two the mayor of Marseilles awaits us at the town hall. Now, as one hour and a quarter has just struck, I don't think I'm far wrong in saying that in an hour and a half Mercédès will be called Mme Dantès."
005.035 Fernand closed his eyes: a cloud of fire burned his eyelids; he leaned against the table so as not to faint, and, in spite of all his efforts, could not restrain a dull groan which was lost in the noise of the laughter and congratulations of the assembly.
005.036 "That's good acting, isn't it," said Father Dantes. Is this called wasting time, in your opinion? Arrived yesterday morning, married today at three o'clock! Speak to me of the sailors to go smoothly in business.
005.037 --But the other formalities, objected Danglars timidly: the contract, the papers?
005.038 -The contract, said Dantes, laughing, the contract is all done: Mercedes has nothing, nor I either! We are getting married under the regime of the community, and that is it! It was not long to write and it will not be expensive to pay."
005.039 This joke excited a new explosion of joy and bravos.
005.040 "Thus, what we took for an engagement meal," said Danglars, "is quite simply a wedding meal.
005.041 --No, said Dantes; you will lose nothing, be at ease. Tomorrow morning I leave for Paris. Four days to go, four days to return, one day to do in conscience the commission with which I am charged, and on the 1st of March I am back; on the 2nd of March, therefore, the real wedding meal."
005.042 This prospect of a new feast redoubled the hilarity to the point that Father Dantes, who at the beginning of the dinner complained of silence, was now making vain efforts, in the midst of the general conversation, to place his wish for prosperity in favor of the future spouses.
005.043 Dantès guessed the thought of his father and answered it by a smile full of love. Mercedes began to look at the time on the cuckoo clock in the room and made a small sign to Edmund.
005.044 There was around the table that noisy hilarity and individual freedom which accompany, among people of inferior condition, the end of meals. Those who were dissatisfied with their place had risen from the table and gone to find other neighbors. Everyone began to speak at once, and no one bothered to answer what the other person was saying, only his own thoughts.
005.045 Fernand's pallor had almost passed over Danglars' cheeks; as for Fernand himself, he was no longer alive and seemed a damned man in the lake of fire. One of the first, he had risen and walked up and down in the room, trying to isolate his ear from the noise of the songs and the shock of the glasses.
005.046 Caderousse approached him just as Danglars, whom he seemed to be fleeing, had joined him in a corner of the room.
005.047 "In truth," said Caderousse, to whom the good manners of Dantes and especially the good wine of Father Pamphile had removed all the remnants of the hatred which the unexpected happiness of Dantes had thrown the seeds of in his soul, "in truth, Dantes is a nice boy; and when I see him sitting next to his fiancée, I tell myself that it would have been a pity to play the bad joke that you were plotting yesterday.
005.048 - "Also," said Danglars, "you saw that the thing had no follow-up; poor M. Fernand was so upset that he had made me sad at first; but from the moment that he took his side, to the point of having made himself the first wedding boy of his rival, there is nothing more to say."
005.049 Caderousse looked at Fernand; he was livid.
005.050 "The sacrifice is all the greater," continued Danglars, "that in truth the girl is beautiful. Pest! the happy rascal that my future captain is; I would like to be called Dantes only twelve hours.
005.051 -- Shall we go?" asked the sweet voice of Mercedes; "here is two o'clock, and they expect us at a quarter past two.
005.052 --Yes, yes, let's go!" said Dantes, getting up quickly.
005.053 -- "Let us go!" repeated in chorus all the guests.
005. 054 At the same moment, Danglars, who did not lose sight of Fernand seated on the windowsill, saw him open haggard eyes, rise as if by a convulsive movement, and fall back seated on the sill of that window; almost at the same moment a thud resounded on the staircase; The resounding of a heavy step, a confused rumour of voices mixed with the clatter of weapons covered the exclamations of the guests, however noisy they were, and attracted the general attention, which was manifested at the same moment by an anxious silence. The noise approached: three knocks sounded in the door panel; each one looked at his neighbor with an astonished air.
005.055 "In the name of the law!" shouted a vibrant voice, to which no voice answered.
005.056 Immediately the door opened, and a commissioner, wearing a scarf, entered the room, followed by four armed soldiers, led by a corporal.
005.057 Worry gave way to terror.
005.058 "What's the matter?" asked the shipowner, advancing to meet the commissioner, whom he knew; "Certainly, sir, there has been a mistake.
005.059 -If there is a mistake, Mr. Morrel, replied the commissioner, believe that the mistake will be promptly repaired; in the meantime, I am the bearer of an arrest warrant; and although it is with regret that I fulfill my mission, it is no less necessary that I fulfill it: which of you, gentlemen, is Edmond Dantes?"
005.060 All eyes turned to the young man, who, greatly moved, but retaining his dignity, took a step forward and said:
005.061 "It's me, sir, what do you want from me?
005.062 --Edmond Dantes," said the commissioner, "in the name of the law, I arrest you!
005.063 --You are arresting me!" said Edmond with a slight pallor, "but why are you arresting me?
005.064 --I don't know, sir, but your first interrogation will tell you."
005.065 M. Morrel understood that there was nothing to be done against the inflexibility of the situation: a commissioner girded with his scarf is no longer a man, it is the statue of the law, cold, deaf, mute.
005.066 The old man, on the other hand, rushed towards the officer; there are things that the heart of a father or mother will never understand.
005.067 He prayed and begged: tears and prayers could do nothing; however, his despair was so great that the commissioner was touched.
005.068 "Sir," he said, "calm yourself; perhaps your son has neglected some customs or health formality, and, in all probability, when we have received the information we wish to get from him, he will be released.
005.069 --Ah, what does that mean?" asked Caderousse, frowning, to Danglars, who was acting surprised.
005.070 -Do I know? said Danglars; I am like you: I see what is going on, I don't understand it, and I remain confused.
005.071 Caderousse looked for Fernand with his eyes: he had disappeared. The whole scene of the day before was then represented to his mind with a frightening lucidity. It seemed as if the catastrophe had just drawn the veil which the drunkenness of the day before had thrown between him and his memory.
005.072 "Oh! oh!" he said in a hoarse voice, "is this the continuation of the joke of which you spoke yesterday, Danglars? In that case, woe betide the one who made it, for it is very sad.
005.073 -Not at all!" exclaimed Danglars; "you know very well, on the contrary, that I tore up the paper.
005.074 --You did not tear it up, said Caderousse; you threw it into a corner, that's all.
005.075 --Silence, you didn't see anything, you were drunk.
005.076 --Where is Fernand? asked Caderousse.
005.077 -I know that! replied Danglars, probably at his business: but, instead of occupying ourselves with that, let us go and help these poor afflicted people."
005.078 Indeed, during this conversation, Dantes had smilingly shaken hands with all his friends, and had constituted himself a prisoner, saying:
005.079 "Be at ease, the mistake will be explained, and probably I will not even go to prison.
005.080 --Oh, certainly, I will answer for it," said Danglars, who at that moment was approaching, as we have said, the main group.
005.081 Dantès descended the staircase, preceded by the police commissioner and surrounded by the soldiers. A carriage, whose door was wide open, was waiting at the door; he got in, two soldiers and the commissioner got in after him; the door was closed, and the carriage took the road to Marseilles.
005.082 "Farewell, Dantes! Farewell, Edmond!" cried Mercédès as she sprang to the railing.
005.083 The prisoner heard this last cry, which came out like a sob from the torn heart of his fiancée; he put his head through the door, shouted, "Good-bye, Mercédès!" and disappeared at one of the corners of Fort Saint-Nicolas.
005.084 "Wait for me here," said the shipowner, "I'll take the first car I meet, I'll run to Marseilles, and I'll bring you back news.
005.085 --Come on!" shouted all the voices, "come on! and come back very quickly!
005.086 There was, after this double departure, a moment of terrible stupor among all those who had remained.
005.087 The old man and Mercedes remained isolated for some time, each in his own grief; but at last their eyes met; they recognized each other as two victims struck by the same blow, and threw themselves into each other's arms.
005.088 Meanwhile, Fernand returned, poured himself a glass of water, drank it, and went to sit down on a chair.
005.089 As luck would have it, it was on a nearby chair that Mercedes fell out of the old man's arms.
005.090 Fernand, with an instinctive movement, moved his chair back.
005.091 "It's him," said Caderousse to Danglars, who had not lost sight of the Catalan.
005.092 --I don't think so, replied Danglars, he was too stupid; in any case, let the blow fall on the one who did it.
005.093 --You do not speak to me of the one who advised him, said Caderousse.
005.094 --Ah, my goodness, said Danglars, if one were responsible for everything one says in the air!
005.095 --Yes, when what one says in the air falls back by the tip."
005.096 Meanwhile, the groups were commenting on the arrest in every way.
005.097 "And you, Danglars," said a voice, "what do you think of this event?
005.098 --Moi," said Danglars, "I think he will have brought back a few bales of prohibited goods.
005.099 --But if that was the case, you should know it, Danglars, you who were an accounting officer.
005.100 --Yes, that's true; but the accounting officer only knows the parcels that are declared to him: I know that we are loaded with cotton, that's all; that we took the load in Alexandria, from M. Pastret, and in Smyrna, from M. Pascal; don't ask me more.
005.101 --Oh, I remember now," murmured the poor father, clinging to this debris, "that he told me yesterday that he had a case of coffee and a case of tobacco for me.
005.102 --You see," said Danglars, "that's it: in our absence, the customs will have made a visit on board the _Pharaon_, and will have discovered the pot aux roses."
005.103 Mercédès did not believe all this; for, compressed until this moment, her grief suddenly burst into tears.
005.104 "Come on, come on, hope!" said Father Dantes, without really knowing what he was saying.
005.105 --Hope!" repeated Danglars.
005.106 -- "Hope," Fernand tried to murmur.
005.107 But this word choked him; his lips twitched, no sound came out of his mouth.
005.108 "Gentlemen," shouted one of the guests who had remained in the limelight on the balustrade; "gentlemen, a car! Ah! it is Mr. Morrel! courage, courage! no doubt he brings us good news."
005.109 Mercedes and the old father ran to meet the shipowner, whom they met at the door. Mr. Morrel was very pale.
005.110 "Well?" they cried with one voice.
005.111 --Well, my friends!" replied the shipowner, shaking his head, "the thing is more serious than we thought.
005.112 -- Oh, sir," cried Mercedes, "he is innocent!
005.113 --I believe so, replied Mr. Morrel, but he is accused....
005.114 --What of?" asked old Dantes.
005.115 --Of being a Bonapartist agent."
005.116 Those of my readers who lived in the period in which this story takes place will remember what a terrible accusation it was then, that which M. Morrel had just formulated. Mercédès shrieked; the old man dropped into a chair.
005.117 "Ah!" murmured Caderousse, "you have deceived me, Danglars, and the joke has been made; but I do not want to let this old man and this young girl die of pain, and I am going to tell them everything.
005.118 -Shut up, you wretch!" cried Danglars, seizing Caderousse's hand, "or I will not answer for you; who is to say that Dantes is not really guilty? The ship touched at the island of Elba, he went down there, he remained a whole day at Porto-Ferrajo; if any letter were found on him which compromised him, those who would have supported him would pass for his accomplices."
005.119 Caderousse, with the quick instinct of selfishness, understood all the soundness of this reasoning; he looked at Danglars with eyes dazed by fear and pain, and, for one step he had taken forward, he took two backward.
005.120 "Let us wait, then," he murmured.
005.121 --Yes, let's wait," said Danglars; "if he is innocent, we'll set him free; if he is guilty, it's useless to compromise ourselves for a conspirator.
005.122 --So let's go, I can't stay here any longer.
005.123 --Yes, come," said Danglars, delighted to find a companion for retirement, "come, and let them withdraw from there as they may."
005.124 They left: Fernand, once again the support of the young girl, took Mercédès by the hand and led her back to the Catalans. The friends of Dantes brought back, on their side, to the alleys of Meilhan, this old man almost fainted.
005.125 Soon the rumor that Dantes had been arrested as a Bonapartist agent spread throughout the city.
005.126 "Would you have believed that, my dear Danglars?" said M. Morrel, as he joined his accountant and Caderousse, for he himself was hastening back to the city to get some direct news of Edmond from the deputy king's prosecutor, M. de Villefort, whom he knew a little; "would you have believed it?
005.127 - "Madame, monsieur!" replied Danglars, "I told you that Dantes, without any reason, had gone to Elba, and this stay, as you know, seemed to me suspicious.
005.128 --But had you told anyone but me of your suspicions?
005.129 --I would have been well advised not to, sir, added Danglars; you know very well that because of your uncle, Mr. Policar Morrel, who served under the other and who does not hide his thoughts, you are suspected of regretting Napoleon; I would have been afraid of doing wrong to Edmond and then to you; there are some things that it is the duty of a subordinate to say to his shipowner and to conceal severely from the others
005.130 - "Well, Danglars, well," said the shipowner, "you are a good boy; also I had thought of you beforehand, in case poor Dantes had become the captain of the Pharaoh.
005.131 --How do you mean, sir?
005.132 --Yes, I had asked Dantes in advance what he thought of you, and whether he would be reluctant to keep you at your post; for, I don't know why, I thought I noticed that there was some coldness between you.
005.133 -- And what did he answer you?
005.134 -- That he thought he had indeed been wronged in a circumstance which he did not tell me about, but that anyone who had the confidence of the shipowner had his own.
005.135 --The hypocrite! murmured Danglars.
005.136 --Poor Dantes! said Caderousse, it is a fact that he was an excellent boy.
005.137 --Yes, but in the meantime, said M. Morrel, here is the _Pharaon_ without a captain.
005.138 --Oh!" said Danglars, "we must hope, since we can only leave in three months, that by that time Dantes will be set free.
005.139 --Surely, but until then?
005.140 --Well, until then, here I am, Monsieur Morrel," said Danglars; "you know that I know the handling of a ship as well as the first captain who comes along; it will even be an advantage for you to make use of me, for when Edmond comes out of prison you will have no one to thank: he will take his place and I will take mine, that is all.
005.141 --Thank you, Danglars, said the shipowner; this indeed reconciles everything. So take command, I authorize you, and watch over the landing: it is never necessary, whatever catastrophe befalls individuals, that business suffer.
005.142 -Take it easy, sir; but will we be able to see him at least, this good Edmond?
005.143 -- I will tell you that in a little while, Danglars; I will try to speak to M. de Villefort and intercede with him on behalf of the prisoner. I know that he is a rabid royalist, but, what the heck! As much a royalist as he is and as much a king's prosecutor as he is, he is also a man, and I don't think he is a bad man.
005.144 --No, said Danglars, but I have heard that he is ambitious, and that is very similar.
005.145 --Finally," said M. Morrel with a sigh, "we will see; go on board, I will meet you there."
005.146 And he left the two friends to take the road to the courthouse.
005.147 "You see," said Danglars to Caderousse, "the turn the case is taking. Do you still feel like going to support Dantes now?
005.148 --No, no doubt; but it is nevertheless a terrible thing that a joke has such consequences.
005.149 --Who did it? It was neither you nor I, was it? it was Fernand. You know very well that I threw the paper into a corner: I even thought I had torn it up.
005.150 -- No, no, said Caderousse. Oh, as for that, I am sure of it; I see it at the corner of the arbour, all crumpled up, all rolled up, and I would even like it to be still where I see it!
005.151 --What do you want? Fernand will have picked it up, Fernand will have copied it or had it copied, Fernand will perhaps not even have taken the trouble; and, I think of it... my God! he may have sent my own letter! Fortunately I had disguised my handwriting.
005.152 --But you knew that Dantes was conspiring?
005.153 -I knew nothing in the world. As I said, I thought I was making a joke, not anything else. It seems that, like Harlequin, I told the truth while laughing.
005.154 -It's all the same," Caderousse continued, "I would give a great deal not to have had this whole affair, or at least not to have had anything to do with it. You will see that it will bring us bad luck, Danglars!
005.155 -If it should bring misfortune to anyone, it should be to the real culprit, and the real culprit is Fernand and not us. What misfortune do you want to happen to us? We have only to keep quiet, without breathing a word of it, and the storm will pass without the thunder falling.
005.156 --Amen! said Caderousse, waving good-bye to Danglars and heading for the Meilhan alleys, while shaking his head and talking to himself, as people who are very worried are wont to do.
005.157 -Good! said Danglars, things are taking the turn I had foreseen: here I am acting captain, and if that idiot Caderousse can keep quiet, captain for good. So there is only the case where justice would release Dantes? Oh, but," he added with a smile, "justice is justice, and I will defer to it."
005.158 And with that he jumped into a boat, ordering the boatman to take him on board the _Pharaon_, where the shipowner, it will be remembered, had given him an appointment.
006.000 The substitute of the king's prosecutor.
006.001 Rue du Grand-Cours, opposite the fountain of the Medusas, in one of these old houses with aristocratic architecture built by Puget, one also celebrated the same day, at the same hour, a meal of engagement.
006.002 Only, instead of the actors of this other scene being people of the people, sailors and soldiers, they belonged to the head of the society of Marseilles. They were former magistrates who had given the resignation of their office under the usurper; old officers who had deserted our ranks to pass in those of the army of Condé; young people brought up by their family still badly reassured on their existence, in spite of the four or five replacements which it had paid, in the hatred of this man of whom five years of exile were to make a martyr, and fifteen years of Restoration a god.
006.003 One was at table, and the conversation rolled, burning with all the passions, the passions of the time, passions all the more terrible, alive and bitter in the Midi that for five hundred years the religious hatreds came to the aid of the political hatreds.
006.004 The Emperor, king of the island of Elba after having been sovereign of a part of the world, reigning over a population of five to six thousand souls, after having heard shouting: Long live Napoleon! by one hundred and twenty million subjects and in ten different languages, was treated there like a man lost forever for France and for the throne. The magistrates pointed out the political blunders; the military spoke of Moscow and Leipsick; the women, of his divorce with Josephine. It seemed to this royalist world, all joyful and all triumphant not of the fall of the man, but of the annihilation of the principle, that the life started again for him, and that he left a painful dream.
006.005 An old man, decorated with the cross of Saint Louis, rose and proposed the health of king Louis XVIII to his guests; it was the marquis of Saint-Méran.
006.006 At this toast, which recalled at the same time the exile of Hartwell and the king pacifier of France, the rumour was great, the glasses rose in the English manner, the women detached their bouquets and strewed the tablecloth with them. It was an almost poetic enthusiasm.
006. 007 "They would agree, if they were there," said the Marquise de Saint-Méran, a woman with a dry eye, thin lips, an aristocratic and still elegant turn of mind, in spite of her fifty years, "all these revolutionaries who chased us away and whom we in turn let conspire quite quietly in our old castles which they bought for a piece of bread, under the Terror: They would agree that true devotion was on our side, since we were attached to the crumbling monarchy, while they, on the contrary, greeted the rising sun and made their fortune, while we lost ours; they would agree that our king, to us, was truly Louis the Beloved, while their usurper, to them, was never anything but Napoleon the Cursed; isn't that so, de Villefort?
006.008 -- You say, Madame la Marquise? Forgive me, I was not at the conversation.
006.009 -- "Leave those children alone, marquise," said the old man who had given the toast; "those children are going to get married, and naturally they have something else to talk about besides politics.
006.010 --I beg your pardon, my mother," said a young and beautiful person with blond hair and a velvet eye swimming in a pearly fluid; "I am giving you back M. de Villefort, whom I had monopolized for a moment. Monsieur de Villefort, my mother is speaking to you.
006.011 --I am ready to answer Madame if she will repeat her question, which I misheard, said M. de Villefort.
006.012 --We forgive you, Renée, said the marquise with a smile of tenderness which one was astonished to see blossoming on this dry figure; but the heart of a woman is so made, that however arid it may become to the breath of prejudice and the demands of etiquette, there is always a fertile and laughing corner: it is that which God has consecrated to maternal love. One forgives you.... Now I said, Villefort, that the bonapartists had neither our conviction, nor our enthusiasm, nor our devotion.
006.013 -- Oh, madame, they have at least something that replaces all that: it is fanaticism. Napoleon is the Mohammed of the West; he is for all these vulgar men, but with supreme ambitions, not only a legislator and a master, but he is also a type, the type of equality.
006.014 --Equality!" cried the marquise. Napoleon, the type of equality! And what will you do with M. de Robespierre? It seems to me that you are stealing his place to give it to the Corsican; it is however quite enough of a usurpation, it seems to me.
006.015 -- No, madame," said Villefort, "I leave each one on his pedestal: Robespierre, in the place of Louis XV, on his scaffold; Napoleon, in the place of Vendôme, on his column; only the one has made of equality that lowers, and the other of equality that elevates; the one has brought kings to the level of the guillotine, the other has raised the people to the level of the throne. This does not mean," added Villefort, laughing, "that both are not infamous revolutionaries, and that the 9th of Thermidor and the 4th of April 1814 are not two happy days for France, and worthy of being equally celebrated by the friends of order and monarchy; but it also explains how, fallen as he is, never to rise again, I hope, Napoleon has retained his followers. What do you want, marquise? Cromwell, who was only half of all that Napoleon was, had his own!
006.016 -Do you know that what you are saying here, Villefort, smacks of revolution from a distance? But I forgive you: one cannot be the son of a Girondin and not preserve a taste for the land."
006.017 A bright blush passed over Villefort's forehead.
006.018 "My father was a Girondist, madame," he said, "it is true; but my father did not vote for the death of the king; my father was proscribed by the same Terror that proscribed you, and it was not long before he bore his head on the same scaffold that had seen your father's head fall.
006.019 -- Yes, said the marquise, without this bloody memory bringing the least alteration to her features; only it was for diametrically opposed principles that they had both gone up there, and the proof is that all my family remained attached to the exiled princes, while your father was in a hurry to rally to the new government, and that after citizen Noirtier had been a Girondist, Count Noirtier became a senator.
006.020 --My mother, my mother, said Renee, you know that it was agreed that one would not speak any more about these bad memories.
006.021 --Madame, replied Villefort, I will join Mlle de Saint-Méran in asking you very humbly to forget the past. What is the use of recriminating about things in which the will of God himself is powerless? God can change the future; He cannot even change the past. What we men can do is, if not deny it, at least throw a veil over it. Well, I have separated myself not only from the opinion, but also from the name of my father. My father was, or perhaps still is, a Bonapartist and his name is Noirtier; I am a royalist and my name is de Villefort. Let a remnant of the revolutionary sap die in the old trunk, and see, madam, only the offshoot which is moving away from this trunk, without being able, and I would say almost without wanting, to detach itself completely from it.
006.022 "Bravo, Villefort," said the marquis, "bravo, well answered! I, too, have always preached to the Marquise to forget the past, without ever having been able to obtain it from her; you will be happier, I hope.
006.023 -- Yes, that's good, said the marquise, let's forget the past, I don't ask for anything better, and that's agreed; but let Villefort at least be inflexible for the future. Do not forget, Villefort, that we have answered for you to His Majesty: that His Majesty, too, has been willing to forget, at our recommendation (she held out her hand), as I am forgetting at your request. Only if some conspirator falls into your hands, remember that we have all the more eyes on you because we know that you are of a family which perhaps is in connection with these conspirators.
006.024 -- "Alas, madame," said Villefort, "my profession and especially the times in which we live order me to be severe. I shall be severe. I have already had some political accusations to support, and in this respect I have proved myself. Unfortunately, we are not at the end.
006.025 -- You think so? said the marquise.
006.026 -- I am afraid so. Napoleon on the island of Elba is very close to France; his presence almost in sight of our coasts maintains the hope of his partisans. Marseilles is full of officers with half pay, who, every day, under a frivolous pretext, seek quarrel with the royalists; from there duels among the people of high class, from there assassinations among the people.
006.027 -- Yes, said the Count of Salvieux, old friend of M. de Saint-Méran and chamberlain to M. the Count of Artois, yes, but you know that the Holy Alliance is dislodging him.
006.028 --Yes, there was talk of that when we left Paris, said M. de Saint-Méran. And where are they sending him?
006.029 -- To Saint Helena.
006.030 --To Saint Helena! What is this?" asked the marquise.
006.031 -- An island situated two thousand leagues from here, beyond the equator, replied the count.
006.032 -- That's right! As Villefort says, it is a great folly to have left such a man between Corsica, where he was born, and Naples, where his brother-in-law still reigns, and in front of that Italy of which he wanted to make a kingdom for his son.
006.033 --Unfortunately, said Villefort, we have the treaties of 1814, and one cannot touch Napoleon without breaking those treaties.
006.034 --Well, we will break them, said M. de Salvieux. Did he look at it so closely when it was a question of having the unfortunate Duc d'Enghien shot?
006.035 -- Yes, said the marquise, it is agreed, the Holy Alliance will rid Europe of Napoleon, and Villefort will rid Marseilles of his partisans. The king reigns or does not reign: if he reigns, his government must be strong and his agents inflexible; that is the way to prevent evil.
006.036 - "Unfortunately, madame," said Villefort, smiling, "a substitute for the king's prosecutor always arrives when the evil is done.
006.037 --So it is up to him to repair it.
006.038 --I could tell you again, madame, that we are not repairing the evil, but avenging it: that is all.
006.039 --Oh, Monsieur de Villefort," said a young and pretty person, daughter of the Count of Salvieux and friend of Mlle. de Saint-Méran, "try to have a nice trial while we are in Marseilles. I have never seen a court of assizes, and they say that it is very curious.
006.040 --Curious indeed, mademoiselle, said the substitute; for instead of a fake tragedy, it is a real drama; instead of acted pain, it is real pain. This man whom one sees there, instead of, the lowered canvas, to return at home, to have supper with his family and to lie down quietly to start again the following day, returns in the prison where he finds the executioner. You see well that, for the nervous people who seek the emotions, there is no spectacle which is worth that one. Rest assured, mademoiselle, if the circumstance arises I will provide it for you.
006.041 -- He makes us shiver... and he laughs!
006.042 --What do you want... it is a duel.... I have already requested five or six times the death penalty against political or other defendants.... Well, who knows how many daggers at this hour are sharpening in the shadows, or are already aimed at me?
006.043 --Oh, my God!" said Renée, growing darker and darker, "are you speaking seriously, Monsieur de Villefort?
006.044 -- "One could not be more serious, mademoiselle," said the young magistrate, with a smile on his lips. And with these fine trials which mademoiselle desires to satisfy her curiosity, and which I desire, myself, to satisfy my ambition, the situation will only become worse. All these soldiers of Napoleon, accustomed to going blindly to the enemy, do you believe that they think while burning a cartridge or while marching with the bayonet? Well, will they think more to kill a man whom they believe to be their personal enemy, than to kill a Russian, an Austrian or a Hungarian whom they have never seen? Besides, you see, this is what is needed; otherwise our profession would have no excuse. I myself, when I see in the eye of the accused the luminous flash of rage, I feel all encouraged, I exalt myself: it is no longer a trial, it is a fight; I fight against him, he retaliates, I redouble, and the fight ends, as all fights do, by a victory or a defeat. That is what it is to plead! It is the danger which makes the eloquence. A defendant who would smile at me after my reply would make me believe that I spoke badly, that what I said was pale, without vigor, insufficient. Think then of the feeling of pride that a public prosecutor, convinced of the guilt of the accused, feels when he sees his guilty party pale and bow under the weight of the evidence and under the wrath of his eloquence! This head bows, it will fall."
006.045 Renee gave a slight cry.
006.046 "That is speaking," said one of the guests.
006.047 --Here is the man that it is necessary in times like ours! says a second.
006.048 -- Also, said a third, in your last case you were superb, my dear Villefort. You know, that man who had murdered his father; well, literally, you had killed him before the executioner touched him.
006.049 -- "Oh, for parricides," said Renée, "I don't care, there is no punishment great enough for such men; but for the unfortunate political defendants!
006.050 --But that is even worse, Renée, for the king is the father of the nation, and to want to overthrow or kill the king is to want to kill the father of thirty-two million men.
006.051 --Oh, that's all right, Monsieur de Villefort," said Renée, "you promise to be lenient with those whom I recommend to you?
006.052 --Sit down, said Villefort with his most charming smile, we will make my indictments together.
006.053 --My dear, said the marquise, meddle with your hummingbirds, your spaniels and your rags, and let your future husband make his state. Today, the arms are resting and the dress is in credit; there is a Latin word of great depth on this.
006.054 --_Cedant arma togae_, said Villefort, bowing.
006.055 -- I did not dare to speak Latin, replied the marquise.
006.056 --I think I'd rather you were a doctor," said Renée; "the exterminating angel, angel though he is, has always frightened me.
006.057 --Good Renée!" murmured Villefort, covering the young girl with a look of love.
006.058 --My daughter, said the marquis, M. de Villefort will be the moral and political physician of this province; believe me, it is a fine role to play.
006.059 --And it will be a means of making people forget the one played by her father, said the incorrigible marquise.
006.060 --Madame, Villefort resumed with a sad smile, I have already had the honor of telling you that my father had, I hope at least, abjured the errors of his past; that he had become a zealous friend of religion and order, a better royalist than I am perhaps; for he was repentant, and I am only passionate.
006.061 And after this rounded sentence, Villefort, to judge the effect of his faconde, looked at the guests, as, after an equivalent sentence, he would have looked at the audience on the floor.
006.062 "Well, my dear Villefort," resumed the Count de Salvieux, "that is precisely what I answered the day before yesterday in the Tuileries to the minister of the king's household, who asked me for some account of this singular alliance between the son of a Girondin and the daughter of an officer of the army of Condé; and the minister understood very well. This system of fusion is that of Louis XVIII. Also the king, who, without us suspecting it, listened to our conversation, interrupted us by saying: "Villefort, notice that the king did not pronounce the name of Noirtier, and on the contrary pressed that of Villefort; Villefort, thus said the king, will make a good way; it is a young man already mature, and which is of my world. I saw with pleasure that the Marquis and the Marquise de Saint-Méran took him for a son-in-law, and I would have advised them this alliance if they had not come first to ask my permission to contract it."
006.063 -The king said that, Count? exclaimed Villefort delighted.
006.064 --I am reporting to you his own words, and if the marquis wants to be frank, he will confess that what I am reporting to you at this hour agrees perfectly with what the king said to himself when he spoke to him, six months ago, of a project of marriage between his daughter and you.
006.065 --That is true, said the marquis.
006.066 --Oh! but I will owe him everything, this worthy prince. So what wouldn't I do to serve him!
006.067 -- "That's the way I like you," said the marquise, "if a conspirator comes at this moment, he will be welcome.
006.068 --And I, my mother," said Renée, "pray to God that he will not listen to you, and that he will only send M. de Villefort petty thieves, weak bankers, and timid swindlers; in return for which I will sleep in peace.
006.069 - "It is as if," said Villefort, laughing, "you wished the doctor migraines, measles, and wasp stings, all of which only compromise the epidermis. If you want to see me as the king's prosecutor, on the contrary, wish me some of those terrible diseases, the cure of which does honor to the doctor."
006.070 At this moment, and as if chance had only waited for Villefort's wish to be granted, a valet entered and said a few words in his ear. Villefort then left the table with an apology, and returned a few moments later with an open face and smiling lips.
006.071 Renee looked at him lovingly; for, seen thus, with his blue eyes, his mat complexion, and his black sideburns framing his face, he was truly an elegant and handsome young man; so the whole spirit of the girl seemed to hang on his lips, while she waited for him to explain the cause of his momentary disappearance.
006.072 "Well," said Villefort, "you aspired just now, mademoiselle, to have a doctor for a husband; I have at least with the disciples of Aesculapius (they were still talking like that in 1815) this resemblance, that the present hour is never mine, and that I am never disturbed, not even at your side, not even at the meal of my engagement
006.073 --And for what cause are you disturbed, sir? asked the beautiful young girl with a slight concern.
006.074 -- Alas! for a sick man who would be, if one is to believe what I have been told, at any extremity: this time it is a serious case, and the illness borders on the scaffold.
006.075 -- Oh my God!" cried Renée, turning pale.
006.076 -- Truly!" said the assembly all at once.
006.077 --It seems that we have just discovered a little Bonapartist plot.
006.078 --Is it possible? said the marquise.
006.079 --Here is the letter of denunciation."
006.080 And Villefort read:
006.081 "_Monsieur le procureur du roi est prévenu, par un ami du trône et de la religion, que le nommé Edmond Dantès, second in command of the ship the_ Pharaon, _arrived this morning from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been charged, by Murat, with a letter for the usurper, and, by the usurper, with a letter for the Bonapartist committee in Paris_.
006.082 _We shall have the proof of his crime by arresting him, for we shall find this letter either on him, or at his father's house, or in his cabin on board the_ Pharaon."
006.083 --But, said Renee, this letter, which is only an anonymous letter besides, is addressed to M. le procureur du roi, and not to you.
006.084 --Yes, but the king's prosecutor is absent; in his absence, the epistle reached his secretary, who had the mission of opening the letters; he therefore opened this one, sent for me, and, not finding me, gave orders for the arrest.
006.085 - Thus, the culprit is arrested, said the marquise.
006.086 --That is to say, the accused, Renée continued.
006.087 --Yes, madame, said Villefort, and, as I had the honor of telling Miss Renee just now, if the letter in question is found, the sick man is indeed sick.
006.088 --And where is this unfortunate man?
006.089 -- He is at my house.
006.090 -- Go, my friend, said the marquis, do not fail in your duties to remain with us, when the service of the king awaits you elsewhere; go therefore where the service of the king awaits you.
006.091 --Oh, Monsieur de Villefort," said Renée, joining her hands, "be indulgent, it is the day of your engagement!"
006.092 Villefort went round the table, and, approaching the girl's chair, on the back of which he leaned:
006.093 "To spare you an anxiety," he said, "I will do all I can, dear Renée; but, if the clues are sure, if the accusation is true, it will be necessary to cut this Bonapartist weed."
006.094 Renée shuddered at this word _couper_, for this weed that was to be cut had a head.
006.095 "Bah! bah!" said the marquise, "don't listen to that little girl, Villefort, she'll get used to it."
006.096 And the marquise held out to Villefort a dry hand which he kissed, while looking at Renée and saying with his eyes:
006.097 "It is your hand that I kiss, or at least that I would like to kiss at this moment.
006.098 --Truly auspicious!" murmured Renee.
006.099 --In truth, mademoiselle, said the marquise, you are of a desperate childishness: I ask you a little what the destiny of the State can have to do with your fantasies of feeling and your sensibilities of heart.
006.100 --Oh! my mother! murmured Renée.
006.101 --Grace for the bad royalist, madame la marquise," said de Villefort, "I promise you to do my job as substitute for the king's prosecutor in conscience, that is, to be horribly severe."
006.102 But, at the same time that the magistrate was addressing these words to the marquise, the fiancé glanced at his fiancée in secret, and this glance said:
006.103 "Rest assured, Renée: in favor of your love, I will be indulgent."
006.104 Renée answered this look with her sweetest smile, and Villefort left with paradise in his heart.
007.000 The interrogation.
007.001 No sooner had de Villefort left the dining room than he took off his cheerful mask and assumed the grave air of a man called to the supreme office of pronouncing on the life of his fellow man. Now, in spite of the mobility of his physiognomy, mobility that the substitute had, as a skilful actor must do, more than once studied in front of his mirror, it was this time a work for him to frown and to darken his features. Indeed, apart from the memory of the political line followed by his father, and which could, if he did not deviate from it completely, cause his future to deviate, Gerard de Villefort was at this moment as happy as it is possible for a man to become; Already rich in his own right, he occupied at twenty-seven a high place in the magistracy, he married a young and beautiful person whom he loved, not passionately, but with reason, as a substitute for the king's prosecutor can love, and in addition to her beauty, which was remarkable, Mlle de Saint-Méran, his fiancée, belonged to one of the most courtly families of the time; and in addition to the influence of her father and mother, who, having no other child, could keep her entirely to their son-in-law, she still brought to her husband a dowry of fifty thousand ecus, which, thanks to the hopes, this atrocious word invented by the marriage brokers, could increase one day of an inheritance of half a million.
007.002 All these elements together thus made up for Villefort a dazzling total of happiness, so much so that it seemed to him to see spots in the sun, when he had long looked at his interior life with the sight of the soul.
007.003 At the door he found the police commissioner waiting for him. The sight of the black man made him fall at once from the heights of the third heaven to the material earth where we walk; he composed his face, as we have said, and approaching the officer of justice:
007.004 "Here I am, sir," he said to him; "I have read the letter, and you have done well to arrest this man; now give me about him and about the conspiracy all the details you have gathered.
007.005 -Of the conspiracy, sir, we know nothing yet; all the papers seized from him have been enclosed in a single bundle, and placed sealed on your desk. As for the accused, you have seen him by the very letter which denounces him, he is a man named Edmond Dantes, first mate on board the three-masted ship the _Pharaon_, trading in cotton with Alexandria and Smyrna, and belonging to the firm of Morrel et fils, of Marseilles.
007.006 --Before serving in the merchant marine, had he served in the military navy?
007.007 -- No, sir; he is a very young man.
007.008 --What age?
007.009 --Ten or nineteen at the most."
007.010 At this moment, and as Villefort, following the Grande-Rue, had arrived at the corner of the Rue des Conseils, a man who seemed to be waiting for him as he passed approached him: it was M. Morrel.
007.011 "Ah, Monsieur de Villefort!" cried the good man, as he caught sight of the deputy, "I am very happy to meet you. Imagine that we have just made the strangest, most unheard-of mistake: we have just arrested the first mate of my ship, Edmond Dantes.
007.012 --I know that, sir," said Villefort, "and I have come to question him.
007.013 --Oh, sir," continued M. Morrel, carried away by his friendship for the young man, "you do not know the man who is accused, and I know him: imagine yourself the gentlest man, the most honest man, and I would almost dare to say the man who knows his state best in the whole merchant navy. O Monsieur de Villefort! I recommend him to you most sincerely and with all my heart."
007.014 Villefort, as we have seen, belonged to the noble party of the city, and Morrel to the plebeian party; the former was an ultra royalist, the latter was suspected of deaf Bonapartism. Villefort looked disdainfully at Morrel, and answered him coldly:
007.015 "You know, sir, that one can be gentle in private life, honest in his business dealings, learned in his state, and still be a great culprit, politically speaking; you know that, don't you, sir?"
007.016 And the magistrate pressed on these last words, as if he wanted to apply them to the shipowner himself; while his scrutinizing glance seemed to want to penetrate to the bottom of the heart of this man bold enough to intercede for another, when he must have known that he himself needed indulgence.
007.017 Morrel blushed, for he did not feel his conscience was quite clear in the matter of political opinions; and besides, the confidence which Dantes had made to him concerning his interview with the grand marshal and the few words which the Emperor had addressed to him disturbed his mind somewhat. He added, however, with the accent of the deepest interest:
007.018 "I beg you, Monsieur de Villefort, be just as you should be, good as you always are, and give us back poor Dantes very soon!"
007.019 The word "return" rang revolutionarily in the ear of the deputy king's prosecutor.
007.020 "Eh! eh!" he said to himself softly, "give us back... is this Dantes affiliated with some sect of carbonari, so that his protector uses the collective formula without thinking about it? He was arrested in a cabaret, I believe the commissioner told me; in numerous company, he added: it will be some sale."
007.021 Then out loud:
007.022 "Sir," he replied, "you may be perfectly at ease, and you will not have made a useless appeal to my justice if the accused is innocent; but if, on the contrary, he is guilty, we live in difficult times, sir, where impunity would be a fatal example: I shall therefore be forced to do my duty."
007.023 And on this, as he had arrived at the door of his house leaning against the courthouse, he entered majestically, after having greeted with icy politeness the unfortunate shipowner, who remained as if petrified in the place where Villefort had left him.
007.024 The antechamber was full of gendarmes and police officers; in the midst of them, guarded at sight, enveloped by glances blazing with hatred, stood the prisoner, calm and motionless.
007.025 Villefort crossed the antechamber, cast an oblique glance at Dantes, and, after having taken a bundle handed to him by an agent, disappeared, saying:
007.026 "Let the prisoner be brought in."
007.027 No matter how quick this glance was, it had been enough for Villefort to form an idea of the man he was going to have to interrogate: he had recognized intelligence in that broad and open forehead, courage in that fixed eye and that frowned brow, and frankness in those thick and half-open lips, which showed a double row of teeth as white as ivory.
007.028 The first impression had been favorable to Dantes; but Villefort had heard it said so often, as a word of profound politics, that one should beware of one's first move, since it was the right one, that he applied the maxim to the impression, without taking into account the difference between the two words.
007.029 He thus stifled the good instincts which wanted to invade his heart to deliver of there assault to his spirit, arranged in front of the mirror his figure of the great days and sat down, dark and threatening, in front of his office.
007.030 A moment after him, Dantes entered.
007.031 The young man was still pale, but calm and smiling; he greeted his judge with easy politeness, then looked for a seat, as if he had been in the salon of the shipowner Morrel.
007.032 It was only then that he met that dull look of Villefort's, that look peculiar to men of the palace, who do not want their thoughts to be read, and who make their eyes a frosted glass. This look taught him that he was before the law, a figure with dark ways.
007.033 "Who are you and what is your name?" asked Villefort, leafing through the notes which the agent had given him on entering, and which for an hour had already become voluminous, so quickly does the corruption of espionage attach itself to this unfortunate body which is called the accused.
007.034 -- My name is Edmond Dantes, sir," replied the young man in a calm and sonorous voice; "I am second in command on board the ship _Pharaon_, which belongs to Messrs. Morrel and Sons.
007.035 --Your age? continued Villefort.
007.036 -- Nineteen years old, replied Dantes.
007.037 --What were you doing when you were arrested?
007.038 --I was attending the meal of my own engagement, sir," said Dantes in a voice slightly moved, so painful was the contrast of these moments of joy with the gloomy ceremony that was being performed, so dark was the face of M. de Villefort that it made the radiant figure of Mercédès shine with all its light.
007.039 "You were attending the meal of your engagement?" said the substitute, flinching in spite of himself.
007.040 --Yes, sir, I am about to marry a woman I have loved for three years."
007.041 Villefort, as impassive as he usually was, was nevertheless struck by this coincidence, and this moved voice of Dantes surprised in the midst of his happiness awakened a sympathetic fiber in the depths of his soul: he too was getting married, he too was happy, and someone had come to disturb his happiness so that he could contribute to destroying the joy of a man who, like himself, was already touching happiness.
007.042 This philosophical rapprochement, he thought, would have a great effect on my return to the salon of M. de Saint-Méran; and he arranged in advance in his mind, and while Dantès waited for new questions, the antithetical words with the aid of which orators construct those ambitious sentences of applause which sometimes make one believe in true eloquence.
007.043 When his little interior speech was arranged, Villefort smiled for effect, and returning to Dantes
007.044 "Continue, sir," he said.
007.045 --What do you want me to continue?
007.046 -To enlighten justice.
007.047 -- Let justice tell me on what point it wants to be enlightened, and I will tell it everything I know; only," he added in turn with a smile, "I warn it that I don't know much.
007.048 -- Did you serve under the usurper?
007.049 --I was about to be drafted into the Navy when he fell.
007.050 --They say your political opinions are exaggerated, said Villefort, who had not been told a word of this, but who was not angry at making the request as one makes an accusation.
007.051 --My political opinions, sir? Alas! it is almost shameful to say, but I have never had what is called an opinion: I am barely nineteen years old, as I had the honor of telling you; I know nothing, I am not destined to play any role; the little that I am and that I will be, if I am granted the position I aspire to, it is to M. Morrel that I will owe it. Also, all my opinions, I will not say political, but private, are limited to these three feelings: I love my father, I respect M. Morrel and I adore Mercédès. There, sir, is all I can say to the law; you see that it is of little interest to it."
007.052 As Dantes spoke, Villefort looked at his face, at once so gentle and so open, and felt himself returning to the memory the words of Renée, who, without knowing him, had asked him for his indulgence for the accused. With the habit that the prosecutor already had of crime and criminals, he saw, at every word of Dantes, the proof of his innocence. Indeed, this young man, one might almost say this child, simple, natural, eloquent with that eloquence of the heart which one never finds when one is looking for it, full of affection for all, because he was happy, and because happiness makes even the wicked good, poured out even on his judge the gentle affability which overflowed from his heart, Edmond had in his look, in his voice, in his gesture, all the harshness and severity that Villefort had shown him, only caresses and kindness for the one who was questioning him.
007.053 "By Jove," said Villefort to himself, "here is a charming boy, and I shall have no great difficulty, I hope, in making myself welcome to Renée by fulfilling the first recommendation she made to me: that will earn me a good handshake in front of everyone and a charming kiss in a corner."
007.054 And at this sweet hope Villefort's face blossomed; so that, when he shifted his gaze from his thought to Dantes, Dantes, who had followed all the movements of his judge's physiognomy, smiled like his thought.
007.055 "Monsieur," said Villefort, "do you know any enemies?
007.056 --Enemies of my own, said Dantes: I have the good fortune to be too little for my position to have made any. As for my character, which is perhaps a little lively, I have always tried to soften it towards my subordinates. I have ten or twelve sailors under my command: ask them, sir, and they will tell you that they love and respect me, not like a father, I am too young for that, but like an older brother.
007.057 --But, in the absence of enemies, perhaps you have jealousy: you are going to be named captain at nineteen, which is a high position in your state; you are going to marry a pretty woman who loves you, which is a rare happiness in all the states of the earth; these two preferences of destiny may have made you envious.
007.058 -- Yes, you are right. You must know men better than I do, and that is possible; but if these envious people were to be among my friends, I confess to you that I would rather not know them so as not to be forced to hate them.
007.059 -- You are wrong, sir. You must always, as far as possible, see clearly around you; and, in truth, you seem to me such a worthy young man, that I am going to depart for you from the ordinary rules of justice and help you to throw light on the matter by communicating to you the denunciation which brings you before me: here is the accusing paper; do you recognize the handwriting?"
007.060 And Villefort drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to Dantes. Dantes looked at it and read. A cloud passed over his forehead, and he said:
007.061 "No, sir, I do not know this writing; it is disguised, and yet it is of a rather frank form. In any case, it is a skilful hand that has drawn it. I am very glad," he added, looking gratefully at Villefort, "to have to do with a man like you, for indeed my envious one is a real enemy."
007.062 And from the flash that passed through the young man's eyes as he spoke these words, Villefort could distinguish all that there was of violent energy hidden beneath that first gentleness.
007.063 "And now, let us see," said the substitute, "answer me frankly, sir, not as a defendant answers his judge, but as a man in a false position answers another man who is interested in him: what is true in this anonymous accusation?"
007.064 And Villefort threw the letter that Dantes had just returned to him on the desk with disgust.
007.065 "Everything and nothing, sir, and here is the pure truth, about my honor as a sailor, about my love for Mercedes, about my father's life.
007.066 --Speak up, sir," said Villefort loudly.
007.067 Then, quite low, he added:
007.068 "If Renée could see me, I hope she would be happy with me, and that she would no longer call me a head-cutter!
007.069 -- Well, on leaving Naples, Captain Leclère fell ill with a cerebral fever; as we had no doctor on board and as he did not want to stay at any point on the coast, in a hurry to get to the island of Elba, his illness worsened to the point that towards the end of the third day, feeling that he was going to die, he called me to him.
007.070 "-My dear Dantes," he said to me, "swear to me on your honor to do what I am going to tell you; it is in the highest interests.
007.071 "--I swear to you, captain," I answered.
007.072 "--Well, since after my death the command of the ship belongs to you, as second in command, you will take this command, you will set sail for the island of Elba, you will disembark at Porto-Ferrajo, you will ask for the grand marshal, you will give him this letter: perhaps then another letter will be given to you and you will be charged with some mission. This mission which was reserved for me, Dantes, you will accomplish it in my place, and all the honor will be yours.
007.073 "--I will do it, Captain, but perhaps one does not arrive as easily as you think near the grand marshal.
007.074 "--Here is a ring that you will send him," said the captain, "which will remove all difficulties.
007.075 "And with these words, he handed me a ring.
007.076 "It was time: two hours later delirium took him; the next day he was dead.
007.077 --And what did you do then?
007.078 --What I had to do, sir, what anyone else would have done in my place: in any case, the prayers of a dying man are sacred; but, among sailors, the prayers of a superior are orders that must be carried out. I therefore sailed to the island of Elba, where I arrived the next day, I consigned everyone on board and I went ashore alone. As I had foreseen it, one made some difficulties to introduce me near the grand marshal; but I sent him the ring which was to be used to me as sign of recognition, and all the doors opened in front of me. He received me, questioned me on the last circumstances of the death of the unhappy Leclère, and, as this one had foreseen, he gave me a letter which he charged me to carry in person to Paris. I promised him, because it was to fulfill the last wishes of my captain. I went ashore, quickly settled all the ship's affairs; then I ran to see my fiancée, whom I found more beautiful and more loving than ever. Thanks to M. Morrel, we passed over all the ecclesiastical difficulties; finally, sir, I was attending, as I told you, the meal of my engagement, I was going to be married in an hour, and I intended to leave tomorrow for Paris, when, on this denunciation which you now seem to despise as much as I do, I was arrested.
007.079 --Yes, yes," murmured Villefort, "all this seems to me to be the truth, and, if you are guilty, it is by imprudence; yet this imprudence was legitimized by the orders of your captain. Give us back this letter which was given to you on the island of Elba, give me your word that you will represent yourself at the first requisition, and go to join your friends.
007.080 --And so I am free, sir! exclaimed Dantes in the height of joy.
007.081 -- Yes, only give me this letter.
007.082 --It must be in front of you, sir; for it was taken from me with my other papers, and I recognize some of them in this bundle.
007.083 --Wait," said the deputy to Dantes, who was taking his gloves and hat, "wait; to whom is it addressed?
007.084 --_To M. Noirtier, rue Coq-Héron, in Paris."
007.085 The lightning which had fallen on Villefort would not have struck him with a more rapid and unforeseen blow; he fell back into his chair, from which he had half risen to reach the bundle of papers seized from Dantes, and, leafing through it hastily, he drew from it the fatal letter, on which he cast a glance imbued with inexpressible terror.
007.086 "M. Noirtier, rue Coq-Héron, nº 13," he murmured, growing paler.
007.087 --Yes, sir," replied Dantes, astonished, "do you know him?
007.088 -- No, Villefort answered sharply: a faithful servant of the king does not know the conspirators.
007.089 --Is this a conspiracy, then?" asked Dantes, who, after having thought himself free, was beginning to regain a greater terror than before. In any case, sir, I told you, I was completely unaware of the contents of the dispatch I was carrying.
007.090 --Yes," said Villefort in a dull voice, "but you know the name of the man to whom it was addressed!
007.091 --To give it to him, sir, I had to know it.
007.092 --And you showed this letter to no one? said Villefort, reading and turning pale as he did so.
007.093 --To no one, sir, on my honor!
007.094 --Doesn't everyone know that you were the bearer of a letter from Elba addressed to M. Noirtier?
007.095 --Everybody, sir, except the one who gave it to me.
007.096 - "It is too much, it is still too much!" murmured Villefort.
007.097 Villefort's forehead grew darker and darker as he advanced toward the end; his white lips, his trembling hands, his burning eyes made the most painful apprehensions pass through Dantes' mind. After this reading, Villefort let his head fall into his hands, and remained for an instant overwhelmed.
007.098 "O my God! what is it, sir?" asked Dantes timidly.
007.099 Villefort did not answer; but after a few moments, he raised his pale and decomposed head, and read the letter a second time.
007.100 "And you say you don't know what was in that letter?" said Villefort.
007.101 "On my honor, I repeat, sir," said Dantes, "I do not know. But what have you yourself, my God! you will find yourself in trouble; do you want me to ring, do you want me to call?
007.102 -- No, sir," said Villefort, rising quickly, "do not move, do not say a word: it is for me to give orders here, and not for you.
007.103 --Monsieur, said Dantès wounded, it was to come to your aid, that is all.
007.104 --I don't need anything; a temporary dazzle, that's all: take care of yourself and not of me, answer."
007.105 Dantès waited for the interrogation which this request announced, but in vain: Villefort fell back into his armchair, passed an icy hand over his forehead streaming with sweat, and for the third time began to read the letter again.
007.106 "Oh, if he knows what this letter contains," he murmured, "and if he ever learns that Noirtier is Villefort's father, I am lost, lost forever!
007.107 And from time to time he looked at Edmond, as if his gaze could have broken that invisible barrier which encloses in the heart the secrets which the mouth keeps.
007.108 "Oh, let's not doubt it!" he suddenly exclaimed.
007.109 --But, in the name of Heaven, sir!" cried the unfortunate young man, "if you doubt me, if you suspect me, question me, and I am ready to answer you."
007.110 Villefort made a violent effort upon himself, and in a tone which he wished to make confident:
007.111 "Sir," he said, "the most serious charges result for you from your interrogation, so I am not the master, as I had hoped at first, to give you back your liberty at once; I must, before taking such a measure, consult the examining magistrate. In the meantime, you have seen how I have acted toward you.
007.112 -- "Yes, sir," cried Dantes, "and I thank you, for you have been a friend to me rather than a judge.
007.113 -- Well, sir, I am going to keep you a prisoner for some time yet, for as short a time as I can; the main charge against you is this letter, and you see..."
007.114 Villefort approached the fireplace, threw it into the fire, and stood there until it was reduced to ashes.
007.115 "And you see," he continued, "I annihilated it.
007.116 --Oh!" cried Dantes, "sir, you are more than justice, you are goodness!
007.117 --But listen to me, continued Villefort, after such an act, you understand that you can trust me, don't you?
007.118 -- Oh sir, give orders and I will follow your orders.
007.119 -- No," said Villefort, approaching the young man, "no, these are not orders I want to give you; you understand that, they are advice.
007.120 --Say, and I will comply with them as with orders.
007.121 -- I am going to keep you here at the courthouse until the evening; perhaps someone else will come to question you: say everything you have told me, but not a word about this letter.
007.122 -- I promise you that, sir."
007.123 It was Villefort who seemed to beg, it was the defendant who reassured the judge.
007.124 "You understand," he said, glancing at the ashes, which still retained the shape of the paper, and which fluttered above the flames: "now this letter is annihilated, you and I alone know that it existed; it will not be represented to you: deny it, therefore, if you are told about it, deny it boldly and you are saved.
007.125 -- I will deny it, sir, rest assured, said Dantes.
007.126 - "Well, well!" said Villefort, putting his hand on the cord of a bell.
007.127 Then stopping at the moment of ringing:
007.128 "It was the only letter you had?" he said.
007.129 --The only one.
007.130 --Take an oath."
007.131 Dantes extended his hand.
007.132 "I swear it", he said.
007.133 Villefort rang the bell.
007.134 The police commissioner entered.
007.135 Villefort approached the police officer and said a few words in his ear; the superintendent replied with a simple nod.
007.136 "Follow him, sir," said Villefort to Dantes.
007.137 Dantes bowed, gave Villefort a last look of gratitude and left.
007.138 No sooner had the door closed behind him than Villefort's strength failed him, and he fell almost unconscious on an armchair.
007.139 Then, after a moment
007.140 "O my God!" he murmured, "what do life and fortune hold! If the king's prosecutor had been in Marseilles, if the examining magistrate had been called instead of me, I would have been lost; and this paper, this cursed paper, would have thrown me into the abyss. Ah, my father, my father, will you always be an obstacle to my happiness in this world, and must I struggle eternally with your past!"
007.141 Then, suddenly, an unexpected glow seemed to pass through his mind and light up his face; a smile came over his still tense mouth, his haggard eyes became fixed and seemed to stop on a thought.
007.142 "That's it," he said; "yes, this letter which was to lose me will perhaps make my fortune. Come on, Villefort, let's get to work!"
007.143 And after having made sure that the accused was no longer in the anteroom, the deputy of the king's prosecutor went out in his turn, and walked briskly towards the house of his fiancée.
008.000 The castle of If.
008.001 While crossing the antechamber, the police commissioner made a sign to two gendarmes, who placed themselves, one on the right and the other on the left of Dantes; a door which communicated from the apartment of the public prosecutor of the king to the palace of justice was opened, and one followed for a while one of these large dark corridors which make shiver those which pass there, when even they do not have any reason to shiver.
008.002 In the same way that Villefort's apartment communicated with the courthouse, the courthouse communicated with the prison, a dark monument adjoining the palace and looked at curiously, from all its gaping openings, by the bell tower of the Accoules, which stands before it.
008.003 After many detours in the corridor which he followed, Dantes saw a door with an iron window open; the police commissioner struck, with an iron hammer, three blows which resounded, for Dantes, as if they were struck on his heart; the door opened, the two gendarmes pushed lightly their prisoner, who still hesitated. Dantes crossed the dreaded threshold, and the door closed noisily behind him. He breathed another air, a mephitic and heavy air: he was in prison.
008.004 He was taken to a fairly clean room, but one that was grilled and locked; as a result, the appearance of his home did not give him too much fear: besides, the words of the deputy public prosecutor, pronounced with a voice that had seemed to Dantes to be so full of interest, resounded in his ear like a sweet promise of hope.
008.005 It was already four o'clock when Dantes was taken to his room. It was, as we have said, the first of March, so the prisoner soon found himself in the night.
008.006 Then his sense of hearing was augmented by his sense of sight, which had just been extinguished: at the slightest noise that penetrated to him, convinced that he was being set free, he rose briskly and took a step towards the door; but soon the noise went dying in another direction, and Dantes fell back on his stepladder.
008.007 Finally, at about ten o'clock in the evening, just as Dantes was beginning to lose hope, a new noise was heard, which this time seemed to him to be heading for his room: in fact, footsteps sounded in the corridor and stopped in front of his door; a key turned in the lock, the bolts creaked, and the massive oak barrier opened, letting the dazzling light of two torches be seen suddenly in the dark room.
008.008 In the light of these two torches, Dantes saw the sabers and muskets of four gendarmes shining.
008.009 He had taken two steps forward and remained motionless in his place when he saw this extra strength.
008.010 "Are you coming to get me?" asked Dantes.
008.011 --Yes," replied one of the gendarmes.
008.012 --From the deputy public prosecutor?
008.013 --But I think so.
008.014 -Well, said Dantes, I am ready to follow you."
008.015 The conviction that he was being sought on behalf of M. de Villefort removed all fear from the unfortunate young man: he therefore advanced, calm of mind, free of gait, and placed himself in the midst of his escort.
008.016 A carriage was waiting at the street gate, the coachman was on his seat, an exempt was sitting near the coachman.
008.017 "Is this carriage here for me?" asked Dantes.
008.018 "It is for you," replied one of the gendarmes, "get in.
008.019 Dantes wanted to make some observations, but the door opened, he felt that he was being pushed; he had neither the possibility nor even the intention of making resistance, he found himself in an instant seated at the back of the car, between two gendarmes; the other two sat on the front bench, and the heavy machine began to roll with a sinister noise.
008.020 The prisoner cast his eyes over the openings, they were grilled: he had only changed prisons; only this one was rolling, and was carrying him along towards an unknown goal. Through the bars, which were so tight that he could hardly get his hand through them, Dantes recognized, however, that he was going along the Rue Caisserie, and that by the Rue Saint-Laurent and the Rue Taramis he was going down to the quay. Soon he saw, through his bars, and the bars of the monument near which he was standing, shine the lights of the Consigne. The car stopped, the exempt got off, approached the guardhouse; a dozen soldiers got out and stood in hedge; Dantes saw, in the light of the street lamps of the quay, their rifles gleaming.
008.021 "Could it be for me," he asked himself, "that such a military force is being deployed?"
008.022 The exempt, opening the door which locked although without pronouncing a single word answered this question, because Dantes saw, between the two hedges of soldiers, a way arranged for him from the car to the port.
008.023 The two gendarmes who were seated on the front bench got off first, then he was made to get off in his turn, then those who were standing beside him followed him. They walked towards a boat which a sailor of the customs maintained near the quay by a chain. The soldiers watched Dantes pass with an air of dazed curiosity. In an instant, he was installed at the stern of the boat, still between these four gendarmes, while the exempt officer stood at the bow. A violent jolt moved the boat away from the shore, four oarsmen swam vigorously towards the Pilon. At a shout from the boat, the chain that closes the harbor was lowered, and Dantes found himself in what is called the Friuli, that is, outside the harbor. The first movement of the prisoner, on finding himself in the open air, was one of joy.
008.024 The air is almost freedom. So he breathed to his full chest that lively breeze which brings on its wings all those unknown scents of the night and the sea. Soon, however, he heaved a sigh; he was passing in front of that Reserve where he had been so happy that very morning during the hour before his arrest, and, through the fiery opening of two windows, the joyous sound of a ball was reaching him.
008.025 Dantes joined his hands, raised his eyes to heaven and prayed.
008.026 The boat continued on its way; it had passed the Tête de Mort, it was in front of the cove of the Pharo; it was going to pass the battery, it was an incomprehensible maneuver for Dantes.
008.027 "But where are you leading me?" he asked one of the gendarmes.
008.028 --You will know in a little while.
008.029 --But still....
008.030 --We are forbidden to give you any explanation."
008.031 Dantes was half a soldier; to question subordinates to whom it was forbidden to answer seemed to him an absurd thing, and he remained silent. Then the strangest thoughts passed through his mind: as one could not make a long journey in such a boat, as there was no ship at anchor on the side where one was going, he thought that he was going to be dropped off on a point far from the coast and told that he was free; He was not tied up, no attempt had been made to handcuff him, which seemed to him to be a good omen; besides, had not the substitute, so excellent for him, told him that, provided he did not pronounce the fatal name of Noirtier, he had nothing to fear? Had not Villefort, in his presence, destroyed this dangerous letter, the only proof he had against him? So he waited, silent and thoughtful, and trying to pierce, with that eye of a sailor trained in darkness and accustomed to space, the darkness of the night. One had left on the right the island Ratonneau, where a lighthouse burned, and while skirting almost the coast, one had arrived at the height of the cove of the Catalans. There the prisoner's eyes redoubled in energy: it was there that Mercédès was, and it seemed to him every moment to see the vague and indecisive form of a woman taking shape on the dark shore.
008.032 How could a presentiment not tell Mercedes that her lover was passing within three hundred steps of her?
008.033 Only one light shone to the Catalans. Questioning the position of this light, Dantes recognized that it illuminated the room of his fiancée. Mercédès was the only one who was watching over the whole small colony. With a loud cry the young man could be heard by his fiancée.
008.034 A false shame held him back. What would those men who were looking at him say when they heard him shouting like a fool? So he remained mute and his eyes fixed on that light.
008.035 Meanwhile the boat continued on its way, but the prisoner was not thinking about the boat, he was thinking about Mercedes.
008.036 An accident on the ground made the light disappear. Dantes turned around and saw that the boat was heading out to sea.
008.037 While he watched, absorbed in his own thoughts, the sails were substituted for the oars, and the boat was now moving forward, pushed by the wind.
008.038 In spite of Dantes' reluctance to ask the constable any more questions, he came closer to him and took his hand.
008.039 "Comrade," he said, "in the name of your conscience and as a soldier, I beg you to have pity on me and answer me. I am Captain Dantes, a good and loyal Frenchman, though accused of I don't know what treason: where are you leading me? Tell me, and, in the name of a sailor, I will do my duty and resign myself to my fate.
008.040 The gendarme scratched his ear and looked at his comrade. The latter made a movement that meant roughly: It seems to me that at this point there is no inconvenience, and the gendarme turned back to Dantes:
008.041 "You are a Marseillais and a sailor," he said, "and you ask me where we are going?
008.042 --Yes, for, on my honor, I do not know.
008.043 --Don't you know?
008.044 --Surely.
008.045 --That's not possible.
008.046 -- I swear to you on the most sacred of worlds. Answer me, please!
008.047 --But the order?
008.048 -- The order does not forbid you to tell me what I will know in ten minutes, in half an hour, in an hour perhaps. Only you can spare me centuries of uncertainty between now and then. I ask you, as if you were my friend, look: I don't want to rebel or flee; besides, I can't: where are we going?
008.049 -- Unless you have a blindfold on your eyes, or you have never left the port of Marseilles, you must nevertheless guess where you are going?
008.050 -- No.
008.051 --Look around you then."
008.052 Dantès rose, naturally cast his eyes on the point where the boat seemed to be heading, and a hundred toises ahead he saw rising the black and arduous rock on which rises, like a superfluity of flint, the dark castle of If.
008.053 This strange shape, this prison around which reigns such a profound terror, this fortress which has kept Marseilles alive for three hundred years with its gloomy traditions, appearing suddenly to Dantes, who was not thinking of it, had the same effect on him as the appearance of the scaffold has on a condemned man.
008.054 "Ah, my God!" he cried, "the Château d'If! and what are we going to do there?
008.055 The gendarme smiled.
008.056 "But I am not being taken there to be imprisoned?" continued Dantes. The Chateau d'If is a state prison, intended only for great political offenders. I have committed no crime. Are there any examining magistrates, any magistrates at the Chateau d'If?
008.057 -- There is, I suppose," said the gendarme, "only a governor, jailers, a garrison, and good walls. Come, come, my friend, do not act so surprised; for, in truth, you would have me believe that you recognize my complacency by making fun of me."
008.058 Dantès shook the gendarme's hand until it broke.
008.059 "You claim, then," he said, "that I am being taken to the Château d'If to be imprisoned there?
008.060 --That is probable, said the gendarme; but in any case, comrade, it is useless to hold me so tight.
008.061 --Without further information, without further formality? asked the young man.
008.062 --The formalities are fulfilled, the information is done.
008.063 --And so, in spite of M. de Villefort's promise?
008.064 -- I don't know if M. de Villefort made you a promise," said the gendarme, "but what I do know is that we are going to the Château d'If. Well, what are you doing? Holà! comrades, to me!"
008.065 By a movement as quick as lightning, which however had been foreseen by the trained eye of the gendarme, Dantes had wanted to dash into the sea; but four vigorous wrists held him back at the moment his feet left the floor of the boat.
008.066 He fell back to the bottom of the boat, screaming with rage.
008.067 "Good!" cried the constable, putting a knee on his chest, "good! Trust then in the gentlemanly people! Well, now, my dear friend, make one move, just one, and I'll put a bullet in your head. I have failed in my first command, but, I assure you, I shall not fail in the second."
008.068 And he actually lowered his rifle toward Dantes, who felt the end of the barrel pressing against his temple. For a moment, he had the idea of making this forbidden movement and of thus putting an end violently to the unexpected misfortune which had fallen upon him and had taken him suddenly in its vulture-like talons. But, precisely because this misfortune was unexpected, Dantes thought that it could not be lasting; then M. de Villefort's promises came back to his mind; then, if it must be said at last, this death at the bottom of a boat, coming from the hand of a gendarme, appeared to him ugly and naked. So he fell back onto the floor of the boat with a howl of rage and gnawed his hands with fury. Almost at the same moment, a violent shock shook the boat. One of the boatmen jumped on the rock which the bow of the little boat had just touched, a rope creaked as it unwound around a pulley, and Dantes understood that they had arrived and were mooring the skiff.
008.069 Indeed, his guards, who held him both by the arms and by the collar of his habit, forced him to get up, compelled him to go ashore, and dragged him towards the steps which lead up to the gate of the citadel, while the exempt officer, armed with a bayoneted musket, followed him from behind
008.070 Dantes, moreover, did not make a useless resistance; his slowness came rather from inertia than from opposition; he was dizzy and staggering like a drunken man. He saw again soldiers who were staggering on the fast slope, he felt stairs which forced him to raise his feet, he noticed that he was passing under a door and that this door was closing behind him, but all this mechanically, as through a fog, without distinguishing anything positive. He didn't even see the sea anymore, that immense pain of the prisoners, who look at the space with the terrible feeling that they are impotent to cross it.
008.071 There was a pause of a moment, during which he tried to collect his thoughts. He looked around him: he was in a square courtyard, formed by four high walls; one could hear the slow and regular step of the sentries; and each time they passed in front of two or three reflections projected on the walls by the glow of two or three lights that shone in the interior of the castle, one could see the barrel of their rifles flicker.
008.072 One waited there for about ten minutes; certain that Dantes could no longer flee, the gendarmes had let him go. They seemed to be waiting for orders, and these orders arrived.
008.073 "Where is the prisoner?" asked a voice.
008.074 -Here he is, answered the gendarmes.
008.075 -- Let him follow me, I'll take him to his lodging.
008.076 --Come on," said the gendarmes, pushing Dantes. The prisoner followed his conductor, who indeed led him into an almost subterranean room, whose naked and sweaty walls seemed impregnated with a vapor of tears. A sort of lantern placed on a stepladder, and whose wick swam in a fetid grease, illuminated the glossy walls of this dreadful stay, and showed Dantes his conductor, a sort of subaltern jailer, badly dressed and of low appearance.
008.077 "Here is your room for tonight," he said; "it is late, and M. le gouverneur is in bed. Tomorrow, when he wakes up and has heard the orders concerning you, perhaps he will change your domicile; in the meantime, here is some bread, there is water in that jug, straw over there in the corner: that is all a prisoner can desire. Good evening."
008. 078 And before Dantes had thought of opening his mouth to answer her, before he had noticed where the jailer was putting that bread, before he had realized where that jug was lying before he had turned his eyes to the corner where the straw that was to serve as his bed was waiting for him, the jailer had taken the lantern, and, closing the door, had taken away from the prisoner that dim reflection which had shown him, as if by the light of a flash, the streaming walls of his prison.
008.079 Then he found himself alone in the darkness and in the silence, as mute and as dark as those vaults whose icy cold he felt lowering on his burning forehead.
008.080 When the first rays of daylight had brought a little light back into the cave, the jailer returned with orders to leave the prisoner where he was. Dantes had not changed his place. An iron hand seemed to have nailed him to the same spot where the day before he had stopped: only his deep eye was hidden under a swelling caused by the humid vapor of his tears. He was motionless and looked at the earth.
008.081 He had thus spent the whole night standing, and without sleeping a moment.
008.082 The jailer approached him, turned around him, but Dantes did not seem to see him.
008.083 He tapped him on the shoulder, Dantes flinched and shook his head.
008.084 "Didn't you sleep," asked the jailer.
008.085 --I don't know," replied Dantes.
008.086 The jailer looked at him with astonishment.
008.087 "Aren't you hungry?" he continued.
008.088 --I don't know," replied Dantes again.
008.089 --Do you want something?
008.090 -- I would like to see the governor."
008.091 The jailer shrugged his shoulders and left.
008.092 Dantes followed him with his eyes, stretched out his hands toward the half-open door, but the door closed.
008.093 Then his chest seemed to burst into a long sob. The tears that swelled in his chest gushed out like two streams, and he fell to the ground with his forehead and prayed for a long time, replaying in his mind all his past life, and asking himself what crime he had committed in this life, still young, that deserved such cruel punishment.
008.094 The day passed thus. He barely ate a few mouthfuls of bread and drank a few drops of water. At times he sat absorbed in his thoughts; at others he walked around his prison like a wild animal locked in an iron cage.
008. 095 One thought especially made him jump: It was that, during this crossing, where, in his ignorance of the place where he was being led, he had remained so calm and so quiet, he could have thrown himself ten times into the sea, and, once in the water, thanks to his skill at swimming, thanks to that habit which made him one of the most skilful divers in Marseille, disappear underwater, escape his guards, reach the coast, flee, hide in some deserted cove, wait for a Genoese or Catalan ship, reach Italy or Spain and from there write to Mercédès to come and join him. As for his life, in no country was he worried about it: everywhere good sailors are rare; he spoke Italian like a Tuscan, Spanish like a child of Old Castile; he would have lived free, happy with Mercedes, his father, because his father would have come to join him; whereas he was a prisoner, locked up in the Château d'If in this impenetrable prison, not knowing what had become of his father, what had become of Mercedes, and all because he had believed in Villefort's word: It was enough to drive him mad; so Dantes rolled furiously on the fresh straw his jailer had brought him.
008.096 The next day, at the same hour, the jailer entered.
008.097 "Well," the jailer asked him, "are you more reasonable today than you were yesterday?"
008.098 Dantes did not answer.
008.099 "Let's see," said the jailer, "a little courage! Do you want something I can use?
008.100 --I wish to speak to the governor.
008.101 --Eh!" said the jailer impatiently, "I've already told you it's impossible.
008.102 --Why is that impossible?
008.103 --Because, according to the prison regulations, a prisoner is not allowed to ask for it.
008.104 --What is permitted here?
008.105 --Better food for a fee, a walk, and sometimes books.
008.106 -- I have no need of books, I have no desire to walk around, and I find my food good; so I only want one thing, to see the governor.
008.107 --If you bore me by repeating the same thing over and over again, said the jailer, I won't bring you any more food.
008.108 --Well, said Dantes, if you don't bring me any more food, I'll die of hunger, that's all."
008.109 The accent with which Dantes pronounced these words proved to the gaoler that his prisoner would be glad to die; also, as every prisoner, on account, brings in ten sous or so a day to his gaoler, Dantes's contemplated the deficit which would result to him from his death, and resumed in a more relaxed tone:
008.110 "Listen: what you desire here is impossible; do not ask for it any more, for it is without example that, at his request, the governor has come to a prisoner's room; only, be very wise, you will be allowed to walk, and it is possible that one day, while you are walking, the governor will pass by: then you will interrogate him, and, if he wants to answer you, that is his business.
008.111 --But, said Dantes, how long can I wait like this without this chance presenting itself?
008.112 - "Oh, lady," said the jailer, "a month, three months, six months, a year perhaps.
008.113 --That's too long, said Dantes; I want to see him at once.
008.114 --Ah! said the jailer, do not absorb yourself in such a way in a single impossible desire, or, before a fortnight, you will be mad.
008.115 --Ah, you think so? said Dantes.
008.116 --Yes, mad. It is always thus that madness begins; we have an example of it here: it was by constantly offering a million to the governor, if he wanted to be set free, that the brain of the abbot who lived in this room before you went haywire.
008.117 --And how long ago did he leave that room?
008.118 --Two years.
008.119 --Was he released?
008.120 --No: he was put in a cell.
008.121 --Listen!" said Dantes, "I am not an abbot, I am not crazy; perhaps I will become so; but, unfortunately, at this hour I still have all my good sense: I will make you another proposal.
008.122 -- What is it?
008.123 -- I will not offer you a million, for I could not give it to you; but I will offer you a hundred écus if you will, the first time you go to Marseilles, go down to the Catalans, and give a letter to a young girl called Mercédès... not even a letter, only two lines.
008.124 --If I carried those two lines and were discovered, I would lose my position, which is a thousand pounds a year, not counting benefits and food; so you see that I would be a great fool to risk losing a thousand pounds to gain three hundred.
008.125 --Well, said Dantes, listen and remember this: if you refuse to warn the governor that I wish to speak to him; if you refuse to carry two lines to Mercedes, or at least to warn her that I am here, one day I will be waiting for you behind my door, and, the moment you enter, I will break your head with this stepladder
008.126 --Threats!" cried the jailer, taking a step backward and putting himself on the defensive; "your head is definitely spinning. The abbot began as you did, and in three days you will be mad as hell, like him; fortunately we have dungeons at the château d'If."
008.127 Dantes took the stepladder, and he twirled it around his head.
008.128 "That's good! That's good!" said the jailer; "well, since you absolutely want it, we'll warn the governor.
008.129 "Good luck!" said Dantes, putting his stepladder back on the floor and sitting on it, with his head down and his eyes haggard, as if he were really going mad.
008.130 The jailer went out, and a moment later returned with four soldiers and a corporal.
008.131 "By order of the governor," he said, "take the prisoner down one floor below him.
008.132 -To the dungeon, then? said the corporal.
008.133 --To the dungeon. You have to put the fools with the fools."
008.134 The four soldiers seized Dantes, who fell into a sort of atony and followed them without resistance.
008.135 They took him down fifteen steps, and opened the door of a dungeon, into which he entered, murmuring:
008.136 "He is right, we must put the madmen with the madmen."
008.137 The door closed, and Dantes went before it, with his hands extended until he felt the wall; then he sat down in a corner and remained motionless, while his eyes, gradually becoming accustomed to the darkness, began to distinguish objects.
008.138 The jailer was right, Dantes was very close to being insane.
009.000 The evening of the engagement.
009.001 Villefort, as we have said, had gone back to the Place du Grand-Cours, and on returning to Mme de Saint-Méran's house, he found the guests he had left at the table sitting in the living room having coffee.
009.002 Renée awaited him with an impatience which was shared by all the rest of the company. Also he was greeted by a general exclamation:
009.003 "Well, slicer of heads, supporter of the State, royalist Brutus!" cried one, "what is it? let's see!
009.004 --Well, are we threatened with a new regime of the Terror? asked the other.
009.005 --Has the ogre of Corsica come out of his cave? asked a third.
009.006 --Madame la marquise, said Villefort approaching his future mother-in-law, I come to ask you to excuse me if I am forced to leave you thus.... Monsieur le marquis, could I have the honor of saying two words to you in particular?
009.007 --Ah! but is it really serious? asked the marquise, noticing the cloud that obscured Villefort's forehead.
009.008 --So serious that I am forced to take leave of you for a few days; so," he continued, turning to Renée, "see if the thing is serious.
009.009 --You are leaving, sir?" cried Renee, unable to hide the emotion caused by this unexpected news.
009.010 -- Alas! yes, mademoiselle," replied Villefort, "it is necessary.
009.011 --And where are you going?
009.012 --That is the secret of justice, madame; however, if anyone here has commissions for Paris, I have a friend of mine who will leave this evening and who will gladly take charge of them."
009.013 Everyone looked at each other.
009.014 "You asked me for a moment of conversation? said the marquis.
009.015 --Yes, let's go to your office, please."
009.016 The marquis took Villefort's arm and went out with him.
009.017 "Well," asked the latter on arriving in his cabinet, "what is going on?
009.018 -Things which I believe to be of the utmost gravity, and which require my departure at once for Paris. Now, marquis, excuse the indiscreet brutality of the question, do you have annuities on the State?
009.019 --All my fortune is in inscriptions; six to seven hundred thousand francs about.
009.020 -- Well, sell, marquis, sell, or you are ruined.
009.021 --But how do you want me to sell from here?
009.022 -- You have a stockbroker, don't you?
009.023 -- Yes.
009.024 --Give me a letter for him, and let him sell without wasting a minute, without wasting a second; perhaps I'll even arrive too late.
009.025 --Diable!" said the Marquis, "let's not waste time.
009.026 And he sat down and wrote a letter to his stockbroker, in which he ordered him to sell at all costs.
009.027 "Now that I have this letter," said Villefort, clutching it carefully in his wallet, "I need another one.
009.028 --For whom?
009.029 --For the king.
009.030 --For the king?
009.031 --Yes.
009.032 --But I dare not take it upon myself to write to His Majesty in this way.
009.033 --And so I do not ask you, but I charge you to ask M. de Salvieux. It is necessary that he give me a letter with the help of which I can penetrate near His Majesty, without being subjected to all the formalities of requesting an audience, which can make me lose precious time.
009.034 --But don't you have the garde des Sceaux, who has his great entrances to the Tuileries, and through whose intermediary you can reach the king day and night?
009.035 --Yes, no doubt, but it is useless for me to share with another the merit of the news that I carry. Do you understand? The Minister of Justice would naturally relegate me to second place and take all the benefit of the thing away from me. I tell you only one thing, marquis: my career is assured if I arrive first at the Tuileries, because I will have rendered the king a service which he will not be allowed to forget.
009.036 -- In this case, my dear, go and pack your things; I will call de Salvieux, and I will have him write the letter which must serve as your pass.
009.037 --Well, don't waste any time, for in a quarter of an hour I must be in the post office chair.
009.038 --Stop your car at the door.
009.039 --Surely; you will excuse me with the marquise, won't you? with Miss de Saint-Méran, whom I leave, in such a day, with a very deep regret.
009.040 --You will find them both in my office, and you can bid them farewell.
009.041 --Thank you a hundred times; take care of my letter."
009.042 The marquis rang; a lackey appeared.
009.043 "Tell the Count of Salvieux that I am waiting for him.... Go, now," continued the marquis, addressing Villefort.
009.044 --Good, I'm only coming and going."
009.045 And Villefort went out running; but at the door he thought that a substitute for the king's prosecutor who would be seen walking with hasty steps would risk disturbing the rest of a whole town; he therefore resumed his ordinary pace, which was all masterly.
009.046 At his door he saw a white ghost in the shadows, waiting for him, standing still.
009.047 It was the beautiful Catalan girl, who, having no news of Edmond, had escaped at dusk from the Pharo to come and find out herself the cause of her lover's arrest.
009.048 As Villefort approached, she broke away from the wall against which she was leaning and came to block his path.
009.049 Dantes had spoken to the substitute about his fiancée, and Mercedes did not need to give her name for Villefort to recognize her. He was surprised by the beauty and dignity of this woman, and when she asked him what had become of her lover, it seemed to him that he was the accused, and that she was the judge.
009.050 "The man of whom you speak," said Villefort abruptly, "is a great culprit, and I can do nothing for him, mademoiselle."
009.051 Mercédès let out a sob, and, as Villefort tried to pass over, she stopped him a second time.
009.052 "But where is he at least," she asked, "that I may inquire whether he is dead or alive?
009.053 --I don't know, he no longer belongs to me," replied Villefort.
009.054 And, embarrassed by this fine look and this suppliant attitude, he pushed Mercédès away and returned, closing the door again quickly, as if to leave outside this pain that was being brought to him.
009.055 But the pain does not let itself push back thus. Like the mortal stroke of which Virgil speaks, the wounded man takes it with him. Villefort returned, closed the door, but when he arrived in his living room his legs failed him; he sighed with a sob, and fell into an armchair.
009.056 Then, at the bottom of this sick heart was born the first germ of a mortal ulcer. This man whom he was sacrificing to his ambition, this innocent who was paying for his guilty father, appeared to him pale and threatening, giving his hand to his fiancée, pale like him, and dragging after him remorse, not that which makes the sick person jump like the furious ones of ancient fatality, but that dull and painful tinkling which, at certain moments, strikes on the heart and bruises it with the memory of a past action, a bruise whose throbbing pains dig an evil which deepens until death.
009.057 Then there was in the soul of this man still a moment of hesitation. Several times already he had demanded, without any other emotion than that of the judge's struggle with the accused, the death penalty against the defendants; and these defendants, executed thanks to his lightning eloquence, which had carried away either the judges or the jury, had not even left a cloud on his forehead, for these defendants were guilty, or at least Villefort believed them to be so.
009.058 But this time it was something else: this sentence of life imprisonment he had just applied to an innocent man, an innocent man who was going to be happy, and whose freedom he was destroying, not only his freedom, but also his happiness: this time he was no longer a judge, he was an executioner
009.059 Thinking of this, he felt that dull throbbing which we have described, and which was unknown to him until then, resounding in the depths of his heart and filling his chest with vague apprehensions. Thus, by a violent instinctive suffering, the wounded man is warned, who will never approach without trembling the finger of his open and bleeding wound before his wound is closed.
009.060 But the wound that Villefort had received was one that does not close, or that closes only to reopen bloodier and more painful than before.
009. 061 If, at that moment, the sweet voice of Renée had sounded in his ear to ask for mercy; if the beautiful Mercédès had entered and had said to him: "In the name of the God who looks upon us and judges us, give me back my fiancé," yes, that forehead, half bent under necessity, would have bent over completely, and with his icy hands would have undoubtedly, at the risk of all that could result for him, signed the order to set Dantes free; But no voice murmured in the silence, and the door only opened to admit Villefort's valet, who came to tell him that the post horses were harnessed to the carriage.
009. 062 Villefort rose, or rather leaped, like a man who triumphs over an inner struggle, ran to his secretary, poured into his pockets all the gold that was in one of the drawers, turned for a moment in awe in the room, with his hand on his forehead, and articulating words without continuation; then at last, feeling that his valet had just placed his coat on his shoulders, he went out, dashed into his carriage, and ordered in a brief voice to touch rue du Grand-Cours, chez M. de Saint-Méran.
009.063 The unfortunate Dantes was condemned.
009.064 As M. de Saint-Méran had promised, Villefort found the marquise and Renée in the study. When he saw Renée, the young man flinched, for he thought she was going to ask him again for Dantes' freedom. But, alas! it must be said to the shame of our selfishness, the beautiful young girl was preoccupied with only one thing: the departure of Villefort.
009.065 She loved Villefort, and Villefort was going to leave when he became her husband. Villefort could not say when he would return, and Renée, instead of pitying Dantes, cursed the man who, by his crime, separated her from her lover.
009.066 What was Mercedes to say?
009.067 Poor Mercedes had found Fernand at the corner of the Rue de la Loge, who had followed her; she had returned to the Catalans, and dying, desperate, she had thrown herself on her bed. In front of this bed, Fernand had put himself on his knees, and pressing his icy hand, which Mercedes did not think of withdrawing, he covered it with burning kisses that Mercedes did not even feel.
009.068 She spent the night thus. The lamp went out when the oil ran out: she did not see the darkness any more than she had seen the light, and the day returned without her seeing the day.
009.069 Pain had put a blindfold before her eyes that let her see only Edmond.
009.070 "Ah, there you are!" she said at last, turning to face Fernand.
009.071 --Since yesterday I have not left you," answered Fernand with a painful sigh.
009.072 M. Morrel had not thought himself beaten: he had learned that, following his interrogation, Dantes had been taken to prison; He had then run to all his friends, he had presented himself to the people of Marseilles who could have influence, but already the rumor had spread that the young man had been arrested as a Bonapartist agent, and as, at that time, the most risky people considered any attempt by Napoleon to return to the throne as a foolish dream, he had found everywhere only coldness, fear or refusal, and he had returned home in despair, but admitting however that the position was serious and that no one could do anything.
009.073 For his part, Caderousse was very worried and tormented: instead of going out as M. Morrel had done, instead of trying something in favor of Dantes, for whom, moreover, he could do nothing, he had locked himself up with two bottles of blackcurrant wine, and had tried to drown his anxiety in drunkenness. But, in the state of mind in which he found himself, two bottles were too little to extinguish his judgment; so he had remained, too drunk to go and look for other wine, not so drunk that drunkenness would have extinguished his memories, leaning in front of his two empty bottles on a lame table, and seeing dancing, in the reflection of his candle with the long wick, all those spectres, which Hoffmann has sown on his punch-dampened manuscripts, like a black and fantastic dust.
009. 074 Danglars, alone, was neither tormented nor worried; Danglars was even joyful, for he had avenged himself of an enemy and had secured, on board the _Pharaon_, his place which he feared to lose; Danglars was one of those men of calculation who are born with a pen behind the ear and an inkwell in place of the heart; everything was for him in this world subtraction or multiplication, and a figure seemed to him much more precious than a man, when this figure could increase the total that this man could decrease.
009.075 Danglars had gone to bed at his usual time and was sleeping peacefully.
009.076 Villefort, after receiving M. de Salvieux's letter, kissing Renée on both cheeks, kissing Mme. de Saint-Méran's hand, and shaking the marquis's, ran to the post office on the road to Aix.
009.077 Father Dantes was dying of pain and anxiety.
009.078 As for Edmond, we know what had become of him.
010.000 The small cabinet of the Tuileries.
010.001 Let's abandon Villefort on the road to Paris, where, thanks to the triple guides he pays, he burns up the road, and let's penetrate through the two or three salons that precede him into this little cabinet in the Tuileries, with its arched window, so well known for having been the favorite cabinet of Napoleon and Louis XVIII, and for being today that of Louis-Philippe.
010. 002 There, in this cabinet, seated in front of a walnut table which he had brought back from Hartwell, and which, by one of those manias familiar to great people, he was particularly fond of, King Louis XVIII was listening rather lightly to a man of fifty to fifty-two years old, He was listening rather lightly to a man of fifty or fifty-two, with gray hair, an aristocratic figure, and a scrupulous bearing, while noting in the margin a volume of Horace, an edition of Gryphias, which was rather incorrect, though esteemed, and which lent itself much to the sagacious philological observations of His Majesty.
010.003 "You say, then, sir?" said the king.
010.004 --That I am very worried, Sire.
010.005 --Really? Did you see in a dream seven fat cows and seven thin cows?
010.006 -- No, Sire, for that would only announce seven years of fertility and seven years of famine, and with a king as far-sighted as Your Majesty is, famine is not to be feared.
010.007 - What other plague is it, my dear Blacas?
010.008 --Sire, I believe, I have every reason to believe that a storm is forming in the south.
010.009 -- Well, my dear Duke," replied Louis XVIII, "I think you are misinformed, and I know positively, on the contrary, that the weather is very fine on that side.
010.010 As witty a man as he was, Louis XVIII liked an easy joke.
010.011 "Sire," said M. de Blacas, "if only to reassure a faithful servant, could not Your Majesty send to Languedoc, Provence and Dauphiné reliable men who would report to him on the spirit of these three provinces?
010.012 --_Conimus surdis_, replied the king, while continuing to annotate his Horace.
010.013 --Sire, replied the courtier, laughing, so as to seem to understand the hemistasis of the poet of Vénouse, Your Majesty may be perfectly right in counting on the good spirit of France; but I believe I am not entirely wrong in fearing some desperate attempt.
010.014 --From whom?
010.015 --From Bonaparte, or at least from his party.
010.016 --My dear Blacas, said the king, you prevent me from working with your fears.
010.017 -- And I, Sire, you prevent me from sleeping with your security.
010.018 --Wait, my dear, wait, I hold a very happy note on the _Pastor quum traheret_; wait and you will continue afterwards."
010.019 There was a moment's silence, during which Louis XVIII inscribed, in a handwriting which he made as small as possible, a new note in the margin of his Horace; then, this inscribed note:
010.020 --Continue, my dear duke, he said, rising with the satisfied air of a man who believes he has had an idea when he has begun the idea of another. Continue, I listen to you.
010.021 --Sire, said Blacas, who had for a moment had the hope of confiscating Villefort for his own benefit, I am forced to tell you that it is not mere rumors devoid of any foundation, mere idle news, that worry me. It is a well-meaning man deserving all my confidence, and charged by me to watch the South (the duke hesitated while pronouncing these words), who arrives in post to say to me: A great danger threatens the king. So I came running, Sire.
010.022 --_Mala ducis agi domum_, Louis XVIII continued, noting.
010.023 -- Does Your Majesty command me not to insist on this subject?
010.024 -- No, my dear duke, but extend your hand.
010.025 -Which one?
010.026 -Whichever one you want, over there, on the left.
010.027 -- Here, Sire?
010.028 -- I say left and you look for the right; it is to my left that I mean: there; there you are; you must find the report of the Minister of Police dated yesterday .... But here is Mr. Dandré himself... don't you say Mr. Dandré?" interrupted Louis XVIII, addressing himself to the bailiff who had just announced the Minister of Police.
010.029 --Yes, Sire, M. le baron Dandré," continued the bailiff.
010.030 --That is right, baron," said Louis XVIII with an imperceptible smile; "come in, baron, and tell the duke what you know most recently about M. de Bonaparte. Do not conceal from us anything of the situation, however serious it may be. Let us see, is the island of Elba a volcano, and are we going to see from it the war flaming and all bristling: _belle, horrida bella_?"
010.031 M. Dandré swayed very gracefully on the back of an armchair on which he rested his two hands and said:
010.032 "Has your Majesty been kind enough to consult yesterday's report?
010.033 --Yes, yes, but tell the Duke himself, who cannot find it, what the report contained; detail to him what the usurper is doing in his island.
010.034 --Monsieur, said the baron to the duke, all the servants of His Majesty must applaud the recent news which reaches us from the island of Elba. Bonaparte..."
010.035 M. Dandré looked at Louis XVIII, who was busy writing a note and did not even look up.
010.036 "Bonaparte," continued the baron, "is mortally bored; he spends whole days watching his miners at Porto-Longone work.
010.037 --And he scratches himself to distract himself, said the king.
010.038 --He scratches himself? asked the Duke; what does your Majesty mean?
010.039 --Yes, my dear Duke; have you forgotten that this great man, this hero, this demigod is afflicted with a skin disease that devours him, _prurigo_?
010.040 --There is more, Mr. Duke," continued the Minister of Police, "we are quite sure that in a short time the usurper will be mad.
010.041 --Mad?
010.042 - Mad as a hatter: his head grows weak, sometimes he cries tears, sometimes he laughs out loud; at other times he spends hours on the shore throwing pebbles into the water, and when the pebble has made five or six ricochets, he seems as satisfied as if he had won another Marengo or another Austerlitz. These, you will agree, are signs of madness.
010.043 --Or of wisdom, Monsieur le Baron, or of wisdom," said Louis XVIII, laughing: "It was by throwing stones into the sea that the great captains of antiquity recreated themselves; see Plutarch, in the life of Scipio the African."
010.044 M. de Blacas remained dreamy between these two carelessnesses. Villefort, who had not wanted to tell him everything so that someone else would not take away the whole benefit of his secret, had told him enough, however, to give him serious concern.
010.045 "Come, come, Dandré," said Louis XVIII, "Blacas is not yet convinced; go on to the conversion of the usurper."
010.046 The minister of police bowed.
010.047 "Conversion of the usurper!" murmured the duke, looking at the king and Dandré, who alternated like two shepherds in Virgil. Is the usurper converted?
010.048 --Absolutely, my dear Duke.
010.049 --To good principles; explain that, Baron.
010.050 --Here is what it is, sir duke, said the minister with the greatest seriousness in the world: recently Napoleon passed a review, and as two or three of his old grognards, as he calls them, manifested the desire to return to France he gave them their leave by exhorting them to serve their good king; these were his own words, sir duke, I am certain of it.
010.051 --Well, Blacas, what do you think?" said the king triumphantly, ceasing for a moment to look at the voluminous scoliography open before him.
010.052 -- I say, Sire, that either M. the Minister of Police or I am mistaken; but as it is impossible for it to be the Minister of Police, since he has the salvation and honor of Your Majesty in his keeping, it is probable that it is I who am mistaken. However, Sire, in your Majesty's place, I would like to question the person of whom I have spoken; I would even insist that your Majesty do him this honor.
010.053 -- Gladly, Duke, under your auspices I will receive whomever you wish; but I want to receive him with arms in hand. Minister, do you have a more recent report than this one? For this one is already dated February 20, and this is March 3!
010.054 -- No, Sire, but I was expecting one by the hour. I have been out since morning, and perhaps since my absence it has arrived.
010.055 -- Go to the prefecture, and if there is none, well, well," Louis XVIII continued, laughing, "make one; isn't that the way it is done?
010.056 --Oh! Sire!" said the minister, "thank God, in this respect there is no need to invent anything; every day our offices are cluttered with the most detailed denunciations, which come from a crowd of poor men who hope for a little recognition for services they do not render, but which they would like to render. They rely on chance, and they hope that one day some unexpected event will give a kind of reality to their predictions.
010.057 -That's fine; go, sir," said Louis XVIII, "and remember that I am waiting for you.
010.058 -- I am only coming and going, Sire; in ten minutes I shall be back.
010.059 --And I, Sire," said M. de Blacas, "am going to fetch my messenger.
010.060 -Wait, wait, wait, said Louis XVIII. In truth, Blacas, I must change your arms; I will give you an eagle with outstretched wings, holding between its talons a prey which is vainly trying to escape, with this motto: _Tenax_.
010.061 --Sire, I am listening, said M. de Blacas, gnawing at his fists with impatience.
010.062 -- I would like to consult you about this passage: _Molli fugiens anhelitu_; you know, it is about the deer that flees from the wolf. Are you not a hunter and a great wolf hunter? How do you find, in this double capacity, the _molli anhelitu_?
010.063 --Admirable, Sire; but my messenger is like the deer of which you speak, for he has just traveled 220 leagues in the post, and that in barely three days.
010.064 - That's a lot of fatigue and worry, my dear Duke, when we have a telegraph that only takes three or four hours, and that without his breath suffering in the least.
010.065 --Ah, Sire, you reward this poor young man very badly, who comes from so far away and with so much eagerness to give Your Majesty useful advice; if only for the sake of M. de Salvieux, who recommends him to me, receive him well, I beg you.
010.066 --Mr. de Salvieux, my brother's chamberlain?
010.067 --Himself.
010.068 -- Indeed, he is in Marseille.
010.069 --From there he writes to me.
010.070 -- Does he also tell you about this conspiracy?
010.071 -- No, but he recommends M. de Villefort to me, and asks me to introduce him to Your Majesty.
010.072 --Mr. de Villefort?" exclaimed the king; "is this messenger called M. de Villefort?
010.073 -- Yes, Sire.
010.074 -- And is it he who has come from Marseilles?
010.075 -- In person.
010.076 -- Why don't you tell me his name at once!" said the king, allowing a hint of anxiety to show on his face.
010.077 --Sire, I thought this name was unknown to Your Majesty.
010.078 -- No, no, Blacas; he is a serious, elevated, ambitious spirit above all; and, by God, you know his father by name.
010.079 --His father?
010.080 -- Yes, Noirtier.
010.081 -- Noirtier the Girondist? Noirtier the senator?
010.082 -- Yes, precisely.
010.083 --And Your Majesty employed the son of such a man?
010.084 --Blacas, my friend, you don't understand anything, I told you that Villefort was ambitious: to succeed, Villefort will sacrifice everything, even his father.
010.085 --Sir, should I let him in?
010.086 -- Right now, Duke. Where is he?
010.087 -- He must be waiting for me downstairs, in my carriage.
010.088 -- Go get him for me.
010.089 -- I'm going."
010.090 The duke went out with the vivacity of a young man; the ardor of his sincere royalism gave him twenty years.
010.091 Louis XVIII remained alone, looking back at his half-open and murmuring Horace:
010.092 _Justum et tenacem propositi virum._
010.093 M. de Blacas went upstairs as quickly as he had come down; but in the anteroom he was forced to invoke the king's authority. The powdery garb of Villefort, his costume, in which nothing was in keeping with court dress, had excited the susceptibility of M. de Brézé, who was quite astonished to find in this young man the pretension of appearing thus dressed before the king. But the duke removed all difficulties with a single word: Order of His Majesty; and in spite of the observations which the master of ceremonies continued to make, for the honor of the principle, Villefort was introduced.
010.094 The king was seated in the same place where the duke had left him. On opening the door, Villefort found himself right in front of him: the first movement of the young magistrate was to stop.
010.095 "Come in, Monsieur de Villefort," said the king, "come in.
010.096 Villefort saluted and took a few steps forward, waiting for the king to question him.
010.097 "Monsieur de Villefort," continued Louis XVIII, "here is the Duc de Blacas, who claims that you have something important to tell us.
010.098 --Sire, the Duke is right, and I hope that Your Majesty will recognize this himself.
010.099 - First and foremost, sir, is the evil as great, in your opinion, as I am led to believe?
010.100 --Sire, I believe it to be pressing; but, thanks to the diligence I have shown, I hope it is not irreparable.
010.101 -Speak at length if you wish, sir," said the king, who was beginning to give way himself to the emotion that had overwhelmed M. de Blacas' face and affected Villefort's voice; "speak, and above all begin at the beginning: I like order in all things.
010.102 --Sire, said Villefort, I will make a faithful report to Your Majesty, but I will beg her, however, to excuse me if the trouble in which I am throws some obscurity into my words."
010.103 A glance at the king after this insinuating exordium assured Villefort of the benevolence of his august listener, and he continued:
010.104 "Sire, I have arrived as quickly as possible in Paris to inform Your Majesty that I have discovered within the jurisdiction of my duties, not one of those vulgar and inconsequential plots, such as are daily being hatched in the last ranks of the people and the army, but a real conspiracy, a storm which threatens nothing less than Your Majesty's throne. Sire, the usurper is arming three ships; he is meditating on some project, foolish perhaps, but perhaps also terrible, all foolishness that he is. At this hour, he must have left the island of Elba to go where? I do not know, but certainly to attempt a descent either to Naples, or on the coasts of Tuscany, or even in France. Your Majesty is not unaware that the sovereign of the island of Elba has kept relations with Italy and with France.
010.105 -- "Yes, sir, I know that," said the king, greatly moved, "and even recently we have had notice that Bonapartist meetings were taking place in the Rue Saint-Jacques; but please continue; how did you get these details?
010. 106 --Sire, they result from an interrogation which I made undergo to a man of Marseilles whom I had been watching for a long time and whom I had arrested the very day of my departure; this man, a turbulent sailor and of a Bonapartism which was suspicious to me, was secretly on the island of Elba; He saw the Grand Marshal there, who charged him with a verbal mission for a Bonapartist of Paris, whose name I was never able to make him tell; but this mission was to charge this Bonapartist with preparing the spirits for a return (notice that it is the interrogation which speaks, Sire), for a return which cannot fail to be near.
010.107 --And where is this man? asked Louis XVIII.
010.108 -- In prison, Sire.
010.109 -- And did the matter seem serious to you?
010.110 -So serious, Sire, that this event having surprised me in the middle of a family celebration, on the very day of my engagement, I left everything, fiancée and friends, and postponed everything to another time to come and lay at the feet of Your Majesty both the fears I had and the assurance of my devotion.
010.111 --That's true, said Louis XVIII; wasn't there a plan of union between you and Miss de Saint-Méran?
010.112 -- The daughter of one of Your Majesty's most faithful servants.
010.113 -- Yes, yes; but let us return to this plot, Monsieur de Villefort.
010.114 --Sire, I am afraid it is more than a plot, I am afraid it is a conspiracy.
010.115 --A conspiracy in these times, said the king, smiling, is easy to meditate on, but more difficult to bring to fruition, because, having been restored to the throne of our ancestors yesterday, our eyes are open to the past, the present and the future; for ten months my ministers have redoubled their surveillance to ensure that the coast of the Mediterranean is well guarded If Bonaparte went down to Naples, the whole coalition would be on its feet, only before he was in Piombino; if he went down to Tuscany, he would set foot in enemy country; if he went down to France, it would be with a handful of men, and we would easily overcome him, hated as he is by the population. Rest assured, then, sir, but do not count on our royal gratitude any less.
010.116 - "Oh, here is Mr. Dandré!" cried the Duke of Blacas.
010.117 At this moment, there appeared on the threshold of the door M. le ministre de la Police, pale, trembling, and whose gaze wavered as if he had been struck by a dazzling flash.
010.118 Villefort took a step to withdraw; but a shake of the hand of M. de Blacas held him back.
011.000 The Ogre of Corsica.
011.001 Louis XVIII, at the appearance of this upset face, violently pushed back the table before which he was standing.
011.002 "What is the matter with you, Monsieur le Baron?" he exclaimed, "you seem quite upset: does this confusion, this hesitation, have anything to do with what M. de Blacas was saying, and with what M. de Villefort has just confirmed to me?
011.003 For his part, M. de Blacas approached the baron briskly, but the terror of the courtier prevented the pride of the statesman from triumphing; indeed, in such a circumstance, it was far more advantageous for him to be humiliated by the prefect of police than to humiliate him on such a subject.
011.004 "Sire..." stammered the baron.
011.005 -- "Well, let's see!" said Louis XVIII.
011.006 The Minister of Police, giving way to a movement of despair, went to rush to the feet of Louis XVIII, who stepped back a step, frowning.
011.007 "Will you speak?" he said.
011.008 --Oh, Sire, what a terrible misfortune! Am I to be pitied enough?
011.009 --Sir, said Louis XVIII, I order you to speak.
011.010 -- Well, Sire, the usurper left the island of Elba on February 28 and disembarked on March 1.
011.011 --Where?" asked the king sharply.
011.012 --In France, Sire, in a small port; near Antibes, at the Gulf of Juan.
011.013 --The usurper disembarked in France, near Antibes, at the Gulf of Juan, two hundred and fifty leagues from Paris, on the 1st of March, and you learn this news only today, the 3rd of March! Hey, sir, what you are telling me is impossible: you have been given a false report, or you are crazy.
011.014 -- Alas! Sire, it is only too true!"
011.015 Louis XVIII made an unspeakable gesture of anger and fright, and stood upright, as if an unexpected blow had struck him at the same time in the heart and the face.
011.016 "In France!" he cried, "the usurper in France! But who knows? Didn't they agree with him?
011.017 --Oh! Sire, cried the Duc de Blacas, it is not a man like M. Dandré whom one can accuse of treason. Sire, we were all blind, and the Minister of Police shared the general blindness; that is all.
011.018 --But... said Villefort; then suddenly stopping: "Ah, pardon, pardon, Sire," he said, bowing, "my zeal is getting the better of me, may Your Majesty excuse me.
011.019 - Speak, sir, speak boldly, said the king; you alone have warned us of the evil, help us to seek a remedy.
011.020 --Sire, said Villefort, the usurper is hated in the Midi; it seems to me that if he ventures into the Midi, Provence and Languedoc can easily be raised against him.
011.021 -- Yes, no doubt, said the minister, but he is advancing through Gap and Sisteron.
011.022 --He is advancing, he is advancing, said Louis XVIII; he is therefore marching on Paris?"
011.023 The Minister of Police kept a silence which was equivalent to the most complete confession.
011.024 "And the Dauphiné, sir," asked the king of Villefort, "do you think it can be raised like Provence?
011.025 --Sire, I am sorry to tell Your Majesty a cruel truth; but the spirit of the Dauphiné is far from being equal to that of Provence and Languedoc. The mountain people are Bonapartists, Sire.
011.026 --Allons, murmured Louis XVIII, he was well informed. And how many men does he have with him?
011.027 --Sire, I do not know, said the Minister of Police.
011.028 -How can you not know! Did you forget to inquire about this circumstance? It is true that it is of little importance, he added with a crushing smile.
011.029 --Sire, I could not inform myself of it; the dispatch simply announced the landing and the route taken by the usurper.
011.030 --And how did this dispatch reach you?" asked the king.
011.031 The minister lowered his head, and a bright redness invaded his forehead.
011.032 "By telegraph, Sire," he stammered.
011.033 Louis XVIII took a step forward and crossed his arms as Napoleon would have done.
011.034 "Thus," he said, turning pale with anger, "seven united armies will have overthrown this man; a miracle of heaven will have replaced me on the throne of my fathers after twenty-five years of exile; I will have, during these twenty-five years, studied, probed, analyzed the men and things of this France which was promised to me, so that, having arrived at the goal of all my wishes, a force which I held in my hands bursts out and breaks me!
011.035 --Sire, this is fatality, murmured the minister, feeling that such a weight, light for fate, was enough to crush a man.
011.036 --But what our enemies said of us is true: Nothing learned, nothing forgotten? If I were betrayed like him, I would still console myself; but to be in the midst of people raised by me to dignities, who were to watch over me more preciously than over themselves, for my fortune is theirs, before me they were nothing, after me they will be nothing, and to perish miserably through incapacity, through ineptitude! Ah, yes, sir, you are quite right, it is fatality."
011.037 The minister stood bent under this frightening anathema.
011.038 M. de Blacas wiped his sweaty forehead; Villefort smiled inwardly, for he felt his importance growing.
011.039 "To fall," continued Louis XVIII, who at first sight had fathomed the precipice on which the monarchy was tilting, "to fall and learn of its fall by telegraph! Oh! I would rather go up on the scaffold of my brother Louis XVI, than to descend the stairs of the Tuileries, chased by the ridiculous.... Ridicule, sir, you do not know what it is, in France, and yet you should know it.
011.040 --Sire, Sire, murmured the minister, for pity's sake!
011.041 - "Come closer, Monsieur de Villefort," continued the king, addressing the young man who, standing motionless and backward, was considering the progress of this conversation in which the fate of a kingdom was floating in confusion. "Come closer and tell Monsieur that we could have known in advance all that he did not know.
011.042 --Sire, it was materially impossible to guess the plans that this man was hiding from everyone.
011.043 --Materially impossible! Yes, that is a big word, sir; unfortunately, big words are like big men; I have measured them. Materially impossible for a minister, who has an administration, offices, agents, snitches, spies, and fifteen hundred thousand francs of secret funds, to know what is happening sixty leagues from the coast of France! Well, look here, here is monsieur, who had none of these resources at his disposal, here is monsieur, a simple magistrate, who knew more than you with all your police, and who would have saved my crown if he had had the right like you to direct a telegraph."
011.044 The gaze of the Minister of Police turned with an expression of profound spite upon Villefort, who bowed his head with the modesty of triumph.
011.045 "I do not say this for you, Blacas," continued Louis XVIII, "for if you have discovered nothing, you, at least, have had the good sense to persevere in your suspicion: another than yourself would perhaps have regarded M. de Villefort's revelation as insignificant, or else suggested by a venal ambition."
011.046 These words alluded to those which the Minister of Police had uttered with such confidence an hour before.
011.047 Villefort understood the king's game. Another might have been carried away by the intoxication of praise; but he feared to make a mortal enemy of the minister of police, although he felt that the latter was irrevocably lost. Indeed, the minister who had not, in the fullness of his power, been able to guess Napoleon's secret, could, in the convulsions of his agony, penetrate Villefort's: all he had to do was question Dantes. He therefore came to the minister's aid instead of overpowering him.
011.048 "Sire," said Villefort, "the rapidity of the event must prove to Your Majesty that God alone could have prevented it by raising a storm; what Your Majesty believes on my part to be the effect of a profound insight is due, purely and simply, to chance; I took advantage of this chance as a devoted servant, that is all. Do not grant me more than I deserve, Sire, to never go back on the first idea you conceived of me."
011.049 The Minister of Police thanked the young man with an eloquent look, and Villefort understood that he had succeeded in his project, that is, that, without losing anything of the king's gratitude, he had just made a friend on whom, if need be, he could count.
011.050 "That is well," said the king. And now, gentlemen," he continued, turning back to M. de Blacas and the Minister of Police, "I have no further need of you, and you may withdraw: what remains to be done is the responsibility of the Minister of War.
011.051 -- "Happily, Sire," said M. de Blacas, "we can count on the army. Your Majesty knows how devoted all the reports show us to your government.
011.052 -- Do not speak to me of reports: now, Duke, I know the confidence that one can have in them. But, speaking of reports, Baron, what have you learned about the affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques?
011.053 "On the Rue Saint-Jacques affair!" cried Villefort, unable to contain an exclamation.
011.054 But suddenly he stopped:
011.055 "Pardon, Sire," he said, "my devotion to Your Majesty makes me constantly forget, not the respect I have for her, that respect is too deeply engraved in my heart, but the rules of etiquette.
011.056 - Say and do, sir," resumed Louis XVIII; "today you have acquired the right to question.
011.057 --Sire," replied the Minister of Police, "I was just coming today to give Your Majesty the new information I had gathered on this event, when Your Majesty's attention was diverted by the terrible catastrophe in the Gulf; now this information would no longer be of any interest to the king.
011.058 --On the contrary, sir, on the contrary," said Louis XVIII, "this affair seems to me to have a direct connection with the one with which we are concerned, and the death of General Quesnel will perhaps put us on the track of a great domestic plot."
011.059 At this name of General Quesnel, Villefort shivered.
011.060 "Indeed, Sire," resumed the Minister of Police, "everything would lead one to believe that this death was the result, not of a suicide, as was first thought, but of an assassination: General Quesnel was, it seems, leaving a Bonapartist club when he disappeared. An unknown man had come to look for him that morning, and had given him an appointment in the Rue Saint-Jacques; unfortunately, the general's valet, who was doing his hair at the moment when this stranger was introduced into the cabinet, heard well that he was pointing to the Rue Saint-Jacques, but did not remember the number."
011.061 As the Minister of Police gave King Louis XVIII this information, Villefort, who seemed to be hanging on his lips, blushed and paled.
011.062 The king turned to his side.
011.063 "Isn't it your opinion, as it is mine, Monsieur de Villefort, that General Quesnel, who could be thought to be attached to the usurper, but who was really all mine, died a victim of a Bonapartist ambush?
011.064 --That is probable, Sire," replied Villefort; "but do we know anything more?
011.065 -- We are on the trail of the man who gave the rendezvous.
011.066 -- Are we on his trail?" repeated Villefort.
011.067 -- Yes, the servant gave his description: he is a man of fifty to fifty-two years of age, dark, with black eyes covered with thick eyebrows, and wearing moustaches; he was dressed in a blue frock coat, and wore a rosette of the Legion of Honor on his buttonhole. Yesterday we followed an individual whose description corresponds exactly to the one I have just mentioned, and we lost him at the corner of the Rue de la Jussienne and the Rue Coq-Héron."
011.068 Villefort had leaned against the back of an armchair, for as the Minister of Police spoke he felt his legs give way beneath him; but when he saw that the stranger had escaped the search of the agent who was following him, he drew breath.
011.069 "You will look for this man, sir," said the king to the Minister of Police; "for if, as everything leads me to believe, General Quesnel, who would have been so useful to us at this moment, has been the victim of a murder, Bonapartists or not, I want his murderers to be cruelly punished."
011.070 Villefort needed all his composure not to betray the terror that this recommendation of the king inspired in him.
011.071 "Strange thing!" continued the king with a movement of humor, "the police believe they have said everything when they say: a murder has been committed, and they have done everything when they add: we are on the trail of the culprits.
011.072 --Sire, Your Majesty, on this point at least, will be satisfied, I hope.
011.073 -That's fine, we'll see; I won't keep you any longer, Baron; Monsieur de Villefort, you must be tired from this long journey, go and rest. You have doubtless gone down to your father's?"
011.074 A glare passed over Villefort's eyes.
011.075 "No, Sire," he said, "I stayed at the Hotel de Madrid, Rue de Tournon.
011.076 --But you saw him?
011.077 --Sire, first of all I was taken to see the Duke of Blacas.
011.078 --But you will see him, at least?
011.079 -- I do not think so, Sire.
011.080 --Ah, that's right," said Louis XVIII, smiling in such a way as to prove that all these repeated questions had not been made without intention, "I was forgetting that you are at odds with M. Noirtier, and that this is a new sacrifice made to the royal cause, for which I must compensate you.
011.081 --Sire, the kindness which Your Majesty has shown me is a reward which so far exceeds all my ambitions that I have nothing more to ask of the king.
011.082 -- Never mind, sir, and we will not forget you, rest assured; in the meantime (the king detached the cross of the Legion of Honor which he usually wore on his blue habit, near the cross of St. Louis, above the plaque of the order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and St. Lazarus, and gave it to Villefort), in the meantime, he said, always take this cross.
011.083 - "Sire," said Villefort, "Your Majesty is mistaken, this is an officer's cross.
011.084 --My goodness, sir," said Louis XVIII, "take it as it is; I have no time to ask for another one. Blacas, you will see that the patent is issued to M. de Villefort."
011.085 Villefort's eyes wet with a tear of proud joy; he took the cross and kissed it.
011.086 "And now," he asked, "what orders does Your Majesty have the honor to give me?
011.087 - Take the rest you need and consider that, without strength in Paris to serve me, you can be of the greatest use to me in Marseilles.
011.088 - "Sire," replied Villefort, bowing, "in an hour I will have left Paris.
011.089 - Go, sir," said the king, "and if I should forget you - the memory of kings is short - do not be afraid to recall you to my memory... I am not sure that I will be able to do that, but I am sure that I will be able to do it. Blacas, stay.
011.090 - "Ah, sir," said the Minister of Police to Villefort as he left the Tuileries, "you are entering by the right door and your fortune is made.
011.091 --Will it be long?" murmured Villefort as he saluted the minister, whose career was over, and looked for a carriage to go home.
011.092 A carriage was passing on the quay, Villefort waved to it, the carriage approached; Villefort gave his address and threw himself into the back of the car, letting himself go to his dreams of ambition. Ten minutes later, Villefort had returned home; he ordered his horses to be ready in two hours, and ordered that he be served lunch.
011.093 He was about to sit down to lunch when the bell rang with a firm, open hand: the valet went to open the door, and Villefort heard a voice pronouncing his name.
011.094 "Who can know that I am here?" the young man asked himself.
011.095 At that moment, the valet returned.
011.096 "Well," said Villefort, "what's the matter?
011.097 --A stranger who won't say his name.
011.098 --How can that be! A stranger who does not want to say his name? And what does this stranger want from me?
011.099 -- He wants to speak to the gentleman.
011.100 -- To me?
011.101 -- Yes.
011.102 -- Did he name me?
011.103 --Perfectly.
011.104 -- And what does this stranger look like?
011.105 --But, sir, he's a man of about fifty.
011.106 --Small? Tall?
011.107 --About the size of the gentleman.
011.108 --Brown or blond?
011.109 --Brown, very brown: black hair, black eyes, black eyebrows.
011.110 -- And dressed," Villefort asked sharply, "in what way?
011.111 --A large blue levite buttoned from top to bottom; decorated with the Legion of Honor.
011.112 --That's him," murmured Villefort, turning pale.
011.113 -- "Oh, my goodness!" said the man whose description we have already given twice, appearing at the door, "that's a lot of manners; is it the custom in Marseilles for sons to have their fathers wait on them?
011.114 -My father!" cried Villefort; "I was not mistaken, then, and I suspected that it was you.
011.115 - "So if you suspected it was me," said the newcomer, placing his cane in a corner and his hat on a chair, "allow me to tell you, my dear Gerard, that it is not very kind of you to keep me waiting like this.
011.116 "Leave us, Germain," said Villefort.
011.117 The servant left, showing visible signs of astonishment.
012.000 The father and son.
012.001 M. Noirtier, for it was indeed himself who had just entered, followed the servant with his eyes until he had closed the door; then, fearing no doubt that he was listening in the antechamber, he went to open it behind him: the precaution was not useless, and the speed with which Master Germain withdrew proved that he was not exempt from the sin which lost our first fathers. M. Noirtier then took the trouble to go and close the door of the anteroom himself, returned to close that of the bedroom, pushed the bolts, and returned to offer his hand to Villefort, who had followed all these movements with a surprise from which he had not yet recovered.
012.002 "Ah, do you know, my dear Gerard," he said to the young man, looking at him with a smile whose expression was difficult to define, "that you don't seem pleased to see me?
012.003 -It is so, my father, said Villefort, I am delighted; but I was so far from expecting your visit that it has somewhat diverted me.
012.004 --But, my dear friend," said M. Noirtier, sitting down, "it seems to me that I could say the same to you. You announce your engagement in Marseilles for February 28, and on March 3 you are in Paris?
012.005 -If I am, my father," said Gerard, approaching Mr. Noirtier, "don't complain, for it was for you that I had come, and this journey will perhaps save you.
012.006 - "Oh, really," said Mr. Noirtier, lying down nonchalantly in the armchair where he was sitting, "tell me about it, Mr. Magistrate, it must be curious.
012.007 -My father, have you heard of a certain Bonapartist club which is held in the Rue Saint-Jacques?
012.008 -- No. 53? Yes, I am the vice-president.
012.009 --Mon père, your composure makes me shudder.
012.010 -- What do you want, my dear? When you have been proscribed by the Montagnards, when you have left Paris in a hay wagon, when you have been hunted down in the moors of Bordeaux by Robespierre's bloodhounds, that has hardened you to many things. Go on, then. Well, what happened at this club in the rue Saint-Jacques?
012.011 -- It happened that General Quesnel was summoned there, and that General Quesnel, who left his house at nine o'clock in the evening, was found the next day in the Seine.
012.012 -- And who told you this beautiful story?
012.013 -- The king himself, sir.
012.014 -- Well, I, in exchange for your story, continued Noirtier, am going to tell you some news.
012.015 --Mon père, I think I already know what you are going to tell me.
012.016 --Ah! You know about the landing of His Majesty the Emperor?
012.017 --Silence, Father, I beg you, first for you, and then for me. Yes, I knew this news, and even I knew it before you did, for for three days I have been burning the pavement, from Marseilles to Paris, with the rage of not being able to throw the thought that burns my brain two hundred leagues ahead of me.
012.018 -- Three days ago! Are you crazy? Three days ago, the Emperor was not on board.
012.019 -- Anyway, I knew the plan.
012.020 --And how?
012.021 --By a letter addressed to you from the island of Elba.
012.022 --To me?
012.023 -- To you, and that I surprised in the messenger's wallet. If this letter had fallen into the hands of another, at this hour, my father, you would be shot, perhaps."
012.024 Father de Villefort laughed.
012.025 "Come, come," he said, "it seems that the Restoration has learned from the Empire how to dispatch affairs promptly.... Shot! my dear, how you go! and this letter, where is it? I know you too well to fear that you have left it lying around.
012.026 -- I burned it, for fear that not a single fragment of it would remain: for this letter was your condemnation.
012.027 -- And the loss of your future," Noirtier replied coldly; "yes, I understand that; but I have nothing to fear since you are protecting me.
012.028 -- I do better than that, sir, I save you.
012.029 --Ah, hell, this is getting more dramatic; explain yourself.
012.030 --Sir, I come back to this club on the Rue Saint-Jacques.
012.031 -- It seems that this club is dear to the hearts of the gentlemen of the police. Why didn't they look harder? They would have found it.
012.032 --They haven't found him, but they are on the trail.
012.033 --That is the accepted word, I know it well: when the police are in default, they say they are on the trail, and the government waits quietly for the day when they come to say, with their ears down, that this trail is lost.
012.034 -- Yes, but a corpse has been found: General Quesnel has been killed, and in all the countries of the world that is called murder.
012.035 --Murder, you say? but nothing proves that the general was the victim of a murder: every day one finds people in the Seine, who have thrown themselves into it in despair, who have drowned there not knowing how to swim.
012.036 -My father, you know very well that the general did not drown in despair, and that one does not bathe in the Seine in January. No, no, do not misunderstand, this death is well qualified as murder.
012.037 --And who called it that?
012.038 -The king himself.
012.039 -The king! I thought he was philosophical enough to understand that there is no murder in politics. In politics, my dear, you know as well as I do, there are no men, but ideas; no feelings, but interests; in politics, one does not kill a man: one removes an obstacle, that is all. Do you want to know how things happened? Well, I'll tell you. One believed that one could count on general Quesnel: one had recommended him to us from the island of Elba, one of us goes to him, invites him to go to rue Saint-Jacques to an assembly where he will find friends; he comes there, and there one unrolls to him all the plan, the departure from the island of Elba, the projected landing; then, when he has listened to everything, heard everything, that there is nothing more to be taught to him, he answers that he is a Royalist: then everyone looks at each other; one makes him swear an oath, he does it, but with such a bad grace really, that it was tempting God to swear thus; well, in spite of all that, one let the general leave free, perfectly free. He didn't go home, what do you want, my dear? He left our house: he took the wrong road, that's all. A murder! In truth you surprise me, Villefort, you, deputy of the king's prosecutor, to build an accusation on such bad evidence. Have I ever dared to say to you, when you are practicing your profession as a royalist, and when you have one of my people cut off his head: "My son, you have committed a murder! No, I said, "Very well, sir, you have fought victoriously; to-morrow the revenge."
012.040 --But, father, beware, this revenge will be terrible when we take it.
012.041 --I don't understand you.
012.042 --Are you counting on the return of the usurper?
012.043 -- I admit it.
012.044 --You are mistaken, my father, he will not go ten leagues in the interior of France without being pursued, hunted down, caught like a wild beast.
012.045 --My dear friend, the Emperor is, at this moment, on the road to Grenoble, on the 10th or 12th he will be in Lyon, and on the 20th or 25th in Paris.
012.046 --The populations are going to rise up....
012.047 --To meet him.
012.048 --He has only a few men with him, and armies will be sent against him.
012.049 --Who will escort him back to the capital. In truth, my dear Gerard, you are still only a child; you believe yourself well informed because a telegraph tells you, three days after the landing: "The usurper is landed at Cannes with a few men; we are in pursuit of him." But where is he? what does he do? you don't know anything about it: he is being pursued, that is all you know. Well, we will pursue him thus until Paris, without burning a primer.
012.050 -- Grenoble and Lyon are faithful cities, and they will oppose him with an impassable barrier.
012.051 --Grenoble will open its doors to him enthusiastically, and Lyon will meet him head-on. Believe me, we are as well informed as you are, and our police are as good as yours: do you want proof of this? It is that you wanted to hide your journey from me, and yet I knew of your arrival half an hour after you had passed the barrier; you gave your address to no one but your postillion, well, I know your address, and the proof is that I arrive at your house just as you are about to sit down to dinner; so ring the bell and ask for a second place to sit down; we will have dinner together.
012.052 --In effect," replied Villefort, looking at his father with astonishment, "in effect, you seem to me to be well educated.
012.053 -- My God, the thing is quite simple; you, who hold the power, have only the means that money gives; we, who are waiting for it, have those that devotion gives.
012.054 --Dedication? said Villefort, laughing.
012.055 --Yes, devotion; that is how one calls in honest terms, ambition that hopes."
012.056 And Villefort's father himself stretched out his hand towards the bell-cord to call the servant whom his son did not call. Villefort stopped his arm.
012.057 "Wait, Father," said the young man, "one more word.
012.058 --Say.
012.059 --As bad as the royalist police are, they do know one terrible thing.
012.060 -What is that?
012.061 --This is the description of the man who, on the morning of the day General Quesnel disappeared, showed up at his house.
012.062 --Ah, does the good police know that? And what is this description?
012.063 --Brown complexion, black hair, sideburns and eyes, blue frock coat buttoned up to the chin, rosette of the Legion of Honor in the buttonhole, broad-brimmed hat and cane.
012.064 --Ah! ah! does she know that?" said Noirtier, "and why, then, has she not laid hands on this man?
012.065 --Because she lost him, yesterday or the day before, at the corner of the Rue Coq-Héron.
012.066 --When I told you that your police were fools?
012.067 -- Yes, but at any moment they may find him.
012.068 --Yes," said Noirtier, looking carelessly around him, "yes, if that man is not warned, but he is; and," he added with a smile, "he will change his face and costume."
012.069 At these words he rose, put down his frock coat and tie, went to a table on which were prepared all the pieces of his son's toilet kit, took a razor, soaped his face, and with a perfectly firm hand cut down those compromising sideburns which gave the police such a valuable document.
012.070 Villefort watched him do this with a terror that was not without admiration.
012. 071 His sideburns cut, Noirtier gave his hair another turn: took, instead of his black tie, a colored tie which appeared on the surface of an open trunk; donned, instead of his blue, buttoned frock coat, a Villefort frock coat, brown in color and flared in shape; tried on in front of the mirror the young man's rolled-up hat, seemed satisfied with the way it fitted him, and, leaving the rush cane in the corner of the fireplace where he had placed it, whistled in his nervous hand a small bamboo badine with which the elegant substitute gave to his gait the casualness which was one of its principal qualities.
012.072 "Well," he said, turning back to his astonished son, when this sort of change in sight had taken place, "well, do you think your police recognize me now?
012.073 --No, my father," stammered Villefort; "I hope so, at least.
012.074 -- Now, my dear Gerard," continued Noirtier, "I rely on your prudence to remove all the objects I leave in your care.
012.075 --Oh, rest assured, my father, said Villefort.
012.076 --Yes, yes! and now I believe that you are right, and that you may well, indeed, have saved my life; but, rest assured, I will return this to you soon."
012.077 Villefort nodded his head. "You are not convinced?
012.078 --I hope, at least, that you are mistaken.
012.079 --Will you see the king again?
012.080 --Maybe.
012.081 --Do you want to pass for a prophet in his eyes?
012.082 --Prophets of doom are not welcome at court, Father.
012.083 --Yes, but, one day or another, they are given justice; and suppose a second Restoration, then you will pass for a great man.
012.084 -- Finally, what should I tell the king?
012.085 -Tell him this: "Sire, you are being deceived about the dispositions of France, about the opinion of the cities, about the spirit of the army; he whom you call in Paris the ogre of Corsica, who is still called the usurper in Nevers, is already called Bonaparte in Lyon, and the Emperor in Grenoble. You believe him hunted, pursued, in flight; he walks, fast as the eagle which he brings back. The soldiers, whom you believe dying of hunger, crushed of fatigue, ready to desert, increase like the atoms of snow around the ball which rushes. Sire, go away; abandon France to her true master, to him who did not buy her, but conquered her; go away, Sire, not because you are in any danger, your adversary is strong enough to be merciful, but because it would be humiliating for a grandson of St. Louis to owe his life to the man of Arcole, Marengo, and Austerlitz." Tell him that, Gérard; or rather, go, tell him nothing; conceal your journey; do not boast of what you have come to do and of what you have done in Paris; take up the post; if you have burned up the road to come, devour the space to return; return to Marseilles by night; enter your house by a back door, and there remain quite gentle, quite humble, quite secret, quite harmless above all, for this time, I swear to you, we shall act as vigorous people who know their enemies. Go, my son, go, my dear Gerard, and in return for this obedience to paternal orders, or, if you like it better, this deference to the advice of a friend, we will keep you in your place. It will be," added Noirtier, smiling, "a means for you to save me a second time, if the political tilt puts you back on top one day and me on the bottom. Farewell, my dear Gerard; on your next trip, come down to my house."
012.086 And Noirtier went out at these words, with the tranquility that had not left him for a moment during the duration of this so difficult interview.
012.087 Villefort, pale and agitated, ran to the window, half-opened the curtain, and saw him pass, calm and impassive, in the midst of two or three men of bad character, ambushed at the corner of the bollards and the angle of the streets, who were perhaps there to arrest the man with the black sideburns, the blue frock coat, and the broad-brimmed hat.
012.088 Villefort remained thus, standing and panting, until his father had disappeared at the crossroads of Bussy. Then he rushed towards the objects he had abandoned, put the black tie and the blue frock coat deep into his trunk, twisted the hat which he stuffed into the bottom of a cupboard, broke the rush cane into three pieces which he threw into the fire, put on a travelling cap, called his valet, forbade him with one look the thousand questions he wanted to ask, settled his account with the hotel, jumped into his carriage which was waiting for him all harnessed, learned in Lyon that Bonaparte had just entered Grenoble, and, in the middle of the agitation which reigned all along the road, arrived at Marseilles, in prey to all the trances which enter the heart of the man with the ambition and the first honours.
013.000 The Hundred Days.
013.001 M. Noirtier was a good prophet, and things went quickly, as he had said. Everyone knows this return from Elba, a strange, miraculous return, which, without example in the past, will probably remain without imitation in the future.
013.002 Louis XVIII tried only weakly to parry this so hard blow: his little confidence in the men took away his confidence in the events. Royalty, or rather monarchy, barely reconstituted by him, trembled on its still uncertain base, and a single gesture by the Emperor brought down the whole edifice, a shapeless mixture of old prejudices and new ideas. Villefort therefore only received from his king a recognition which was not only useless for the moment, but even dangerous, and this cross of officer of the Legion of Honor, which he had the prudence not to show, although M. de Blacas, as the king had recommended to him, had had the patent carefully sent to him.
013.003 Napoleon would certainly have dismissed Villefort without the protection of Noirtier, who had become all-powerful at the court of the Hundred Days, both by the perils he had faced and by the services he had rendered. Thus, as he had promised him, the Girondin of 93 and the senator of 1806 protected the one who had protected him the day before.
013.004 All of Villefort's power was therefore limited, during this evocation of the empire, whose second fall, incidentally, it was easy to foresee, to suppress the secret that Dantes had been about to divulge.
013.005 The prosecutor of the king alone was destituted, suspected that it was of lukewarmness in bonapartism.
013. 006 However, hardly the imperial power was re-established, that is to say hardly the emperor inhabited these Tuileries that Louis XVIII had just left, and had launched his numerous and divergent orders of this small cabinet where we have, following Villefort, introduced our readers, and on the walnut table of which he found, still quite open and half-full, the snuffbox of Louis XVIII, that Marseille, in spite of the attitude of its magistrates, began to feel fermenting in it these brandons of civil war always badly extinguished in the South; It was not long before the reprisals went beyond some charivaris with which one besieged the royalists locked up at home, and of the public affronts with which one pursued those who ventured to leave.
013.007 By a very natural reversal, the worthy shipowner, whom we have designated as belonging to the popular party, found himself in turn at this moment, we will not say all-powerful, because M. Morrel was a prudent man and lightly trained. Morrel was a prudent and slightly timid man, like all those who have made a slow and laborious commercial fortune, but in a position, all overtaken as he was by the zealous Bonapartists who called him a moderate, in a position, I say, to raise his voice to make a complaint heard; this complaint, as one can easily guess, related to Dantes.
013.008 Villefort had remained standing, in spite of the fall of his superior, and his marriage, while remaining decided, was nevertheless postponed to happier times. If the emperor retained the throne, Gerard needed another alliance, and his father would take charge of finding it for him; if a second Restoration brought Louis XVIII back to France, M. de Saint-Méran's influence would double, as would his own, and the union would become more manageable than ever.
013.009 The deputy king's prosecutor was thus momentarily the chief magistrate of Marseilles, when one morning his door was opened and Mr. Morrel was announced to him.
013.010 Anyone else would have hastened to meet the shipowner, and by this haste would have indicated his weakness; but Villefort was a superior man who had, if not practice, at least an instinct for everything. He made Morrel wait for him, as he would have done under the Restoration, even though he had no one near him, but for the simple reason that it is usual for a deputy to the king's prosecutor to make him wait for him; then, after a quarter of an hour, which he used to read two or three newspapers of different shades, he ordered that the shipowner be introduced.
013.011 M. Morrel had expected to find Villefort downcast: he found him as he had seen him six weeks before, that is to say, calm, firm, and full of that cold politeness which is the most impassable of all the barriers that separate the elevated man from the vulgar.
013.012 He had entered Villefort's study, convinced that the magistrate would tremble at the sight of him, and it was he, on the contrary, who found himself all shivering and all moved before this questioning figure, who was waiting for him with his elbow resting on his desk.
013.013 He stopped at the door. Villefort looked at him, as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him. Finally, after a few seconds of examination and silence, during which the worthy shipowner turned his hat over and over in his hands
013.014 "Monsieur Morrel, I believe?" said Villefort.
013.015 --Yes, sir, myself," replied the shipowner.
013.016 --Come closer, then," continued the magistrate, making a protective sign with his hand, "and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of your visit.
013.017 --Do you not suspect this, sir?
013.018 -- No, not in the least; which does not prevent me from being entirely willing to be agreeable to you, if the thing were in my power.
013.019 --The thing depends entirely on you, sir, said Morrel.
013.020 --Explain yourself, then.
013. 021 --Monsieur, continued the shipowner, regaining his assurance as he spoke, and strengthened moreover by the justice of his cause and the clearness of his position, you remember that, a few days before the news of the landing of His Majesty the Emperor, I had come to ask your indulgence for an unfortunate young man, a sailor, second in command on board my brig; he was accused, if you remember, of relations with the island of Elba: these relations, which were a crime at that time, are today titles of favor. You served Louis XVIII then, and did not spare him, sir; it was your duty. Today, you serve Napoleon, and you must protect him; it is still your duty. I have therefore come to ask you what has become of him."
013.022 Villefort made a violent effort on himself.
013.023 "The name of this man?" he asked: "Have the goodness to tell me his name.
013.024 --Edmond Dantes."
013.025 Obviously, Villefort would have liked as much, in a duel, to wipe out the fire of his adversary at twenty-five paces, as to hear this name pronounced thus at point-blank range; however, he did not bat an eye. "In this way," said Villefort to himself, "I shall not be accused of having made the arrest of this young man a purely personal matter.
013.026 "Dantes?" he repeated, "Edmond Dantes, you say?
013.027 --Yes, sir."
013.028 Villefort then opened a large register placed in a neighboring locker, resorted to a table, from the table passed to some files, and, turning back to the shipowner:
013.029 "Are you quite sure you are not mistaken, sir?" he said to him with the most natural air.
013.030 If Morrel had been a finer man or better informed about this affair, he would have found it strange that the deputy public prosecutor should deign to answer him on these matters which were completely foreign to his jurisdiction; and he would have wondered why Villefort did not refer him to the prison registers, to the prison governors, to the prefect of the department. But Morrel, looking in vain for fear in Villefort, saw only condescension, from the moment when all fear seemed absent: Villefort had met with justice.
013.031 "No, sir," said Morrel, "I am not mistaken; besides, I have known the poor boy for ten years, and he has been in my service for four. I came, do you remember? six weeks ago, to beg you to be merciful, as I come today to beg you to be fair to the poor boy; you even received me rather badly and answered me like a disgruntled man. Ah! it is that the royalists were hard on the bonapartists in those days!
013.032 --Monsieur, replied Villefort, arriving at the parade with his usual poise and composure, I was a royalist when I believed the Bourbons to be not only the legitimate heirs to the throne, but also the chosen ones of the nation; but the miraculous comeback which we have just witnessed has proved me wrong. The genius of Napoleon conquered: the legitimate monarch is the loved monarch.
013.033 --At the right time! exclaimed Morrel with his good big frankness, you please me to speak to me thus, and I augur well for the fate of Edmond.
013.034 -Wait, then," said Villefort, leafing through a new register, "I am there: it is a sailor, is it not, who married a Catalan? Yes, yes; oh, I remember now: the thing was very serious.
013.035 --How did that happen?
013.036 --You know that when he left my house he was taken to the prisons of the courthouse.
013.037 --Well, yes?
013.038 -- Well, I made my report to Paris, I sent the papers found on him. It was my duty, what do you want... and eight days after his arrest the prisoner was taken.
013.039 -- Kidnapped!" cried Morrel; "but what could have been done with the poor boy?
013.040 --Oh, rest assured. He will have been transported to Fenestrelle, to Pignerol, to the Sainte-Marguerite Islands, what is called expatriate, in administrative terms; and one fine morning you will see him return to take command of his ship.
013.041 -- Let him come whenever he wants, his place will be kept for him. But how can he not have come back already? It seems to me that the first care of Bonapartist justice should have been to put out those who had been imprisoned by Royalist justice.
013.042 -- Don't accuse rashly, my dear Monsieur Morrel, replied Villefort; in all things one must proceed legally. The order of incarceration had come from above; the order of freedom must also come from above. Now, Napoleon has been back for hardly fifteen days; hardly also the letters of abolition must be dispatched.
013.043 --But, asked Morrel, is there not a way to hurry up the formalities, now that we are triumphant? I have some friends, some influence, I can obtain a release from the judgment.
013.044 --There was no arrest.
013.045 --The arrest, then.
013.046 -- In political matters, there are no registers of imprisonment; sometimes governments have an interest in making a man disappear without leaving any trace of his passage: imprisonment notes would guide the search.
013.047 --That's the way it was under the Bourbons perhaps, but now....
013.048 -It is like that in all times, my dear Mr. Morrel; the governments follow one another and resemble one another; the penitentiary machine set up under Louis XIV is still going today, except for the Bastille. The Emperor has always been stricter in the regulation of his prisons than the Great King himself was; and the number of incarcerated persons of whom the registers keep no record is incalculable."
013.049 So much benevolence would have diverted certainty, and Morrel had not even a suspicion.
013.050 "But finally, Monsieur de Villefort," he said, "what advice would you give me to hasten the return of poor Dantes?
013.051 -Only one, sir: petition the Minister of Justice.
013.052 --Oh, sir, we know what petitions are: the minister receives two hundred a day and does not read four.
013.053 -- Yes, Villefort continued, but he will read a petition sent by me, apostilled by me, addressed directly by me.
013.054 --And you would take charge of sending this petition, sir?
013.055 --With the greatest pleasure. Dantes might have been guilty then; but he is innocent today, and it is my duty to have the one whom it was my duty to have put in prison restored to freedom."
013.056 Villefort thus averted the danger of an unlikely but possible investigation, an investigation that would lose him without resources.
013.057 "But how does one write to the minister?
013.058 --Sit down, Monsieur Morrel," said Villefort, giving up his seat to the shipowner; "I will dictate to you.
013.059 --Would you be so kind?
013.060 -- No doubt. Let's not waste time, we've already lost too much.
013.061 --Yes, sir, let us consider that the poor boy is waiting, suffering and perhaps despairing."
013.062 Villefort shuddered at the thought of this prisoner cursing him in silence and darkness; but he was engaged too far ahead to turn back: Dantes was to be broken between the cogs of his ambition.
013.063 "I am waiting, sir," said the shipowner, sitting in Villefort's chair with a pen in his hand.
013.064 Villefort then dictated a petition in which, with an excellent purpose, there was no doubt about it, he exaggerated Dantes' patriotism and the services rendered by him to the Bonapartist cause; in this petition, Dantes had become one of the most active agents for the return of Napoleon; it was obvious that, on seeing such a piece, the minister would have to do justice at once, if justice was not already done.
013.065 When the petition was finished, Villefort read it out loud.
013.066 "That's it," he said, "and now rest on me.
013.067 --And the petition will soon leave, sir?
013.068 --Today.
013.069 --Apostilled by you?
013.070 --The best apostille I can put on, sir, is to certify as true everything you say in this petition."
013.071 And Villefort sat down in turn, and on a corner of the petition applied his certificate.
013.072 "Now, sir, what is to be done?" asked Morrel.
013.073 --To wait, resumed Villefort; I answer for everything."
013.074 This assurance restored hope to Morrel: he left the deputy public prosecutor delighted with him, and went to announce to Dantes' old father that he would not be long in seeing his son again.
013.075 As for Villefort, instead of sending him to Paris, he kept preciously in his hands this request which, in order to save Dantes in the present, compromised him so frightfully in the future, by supposing something which the aspect of Europe and the turn of events already made it possible to suppose, that is to say a second Restoration.
013.076 Dantes thus remained a prisoner: lost in the depths of his dungeon, he did not hear the tremendous sound of the fall of Louis XVIII's throne and the even more appalling sound of the collapse of the empire.
013.077 But Villefort had followed everything with a vigilant eye, listened to everything with an attentive ear. Twice, during this short imperial appearance which was called the Hundred Days, Morrel had returned to the charge, still insisting on Dantes' freedom, and each time Villefort had calmed him with promises and hopes; finally, Waterloo arrived. Morrel did not return to Villefort's house: the shipowner had done all that was humanly possible for his young friend; to try again under this second Restoration was to compromise oneself in vain.
013.078 Louis XVIII returned to the throne. Villefort, for whom Marseilles was full of memories that had become remorseful for him, asked for and obtained the vacant position of royal prosecutor in Toulouse; a fortnight after his installation in his new residence, he married Mlle Renée de Saint-Méran, whose father was better in court than ever.
013.079 This is how Dantes, during the Hundred Days and after Waterloo, remained locked up, forgotten, if not by men, at least by God.
013.080 Danglars understood the full significance of the blow with which he had struck Dantes, when he saw Napoleon return to France: his denunciation had hit the mark, and, like all men of a certain scope for crime and of average intelligence for ordinary life, he called this strange coincidence a _decree of Providence_.
013.081 But when Napoleon was back in Paris and his voice resounded again, imperious and powerful, Danglars was afraid; at every moment he expected to see Dantes reappear, Dantes knowing everything, Dantes threatening and strong for all vengeance; then he manifested to M. Morrel the desire to leave the sea service, and was recommended by him to a Spanish merchant, with whom he entered as a clerk of order towards the end of March, that is to say ten or twelve days after the return of Napoleon to the Tuileries; he thus left for Madrid, and one did not hear any more about him.
013.082 Fernand understood nothing. Dantes was absent; that was all he needed. He did not try to find out what had become of him. Only, during all the respite which his absence gave him, he did his utmost, partly to deceive Mercedes as to the reasons for his absence, partly to meditate on plans for emigration and abduction; From time to time, too, and these were the dark hours of his life, he would sit on the point of Cap Pharo, from that spot where one can distinguish both Marseilles and the village of the Catalans, looking, sad and motionless as a bird of prey, to see if he would not see, by one of these two roads, the handsome young man with the free gait, with the high head, who, for him too, had become the messenger of a harsh revenge. Then Fernand's plan was decided: he would break Dantes' head with a shot of the gun and kill himself afterwards, he said to himself, to color his murder. But Fernand was mistaken: that man would never have killed himself, for he always hoped.
013.083 In the meantime, and amidst so many painful fluctuations, the empire called for a final band of soldiers, and all the men in a condition to bear arms rushed out of France at the emperor's resounding voice. Fernand left like the others, leaving his hut and Mercedes, and consumed by the dark and terrible thought that, behind him perhaps, his rival was going to return and marry the one he loved.
013.084 If Fernand had ever had to kill himself, it was in leaving Mercedes that he would have done so.
013.085 His attentions to Mercedes, the pity he seemed to give to her misfortune, the care he took to anticipate her slightest wishes, had produced the effect that the appearances of devotion always produce on generous hearts: Mercedes had always loved Fernand with friendship; her friendship was increased by a new feeling, gratitude.
013.086 "My brother," she said, fastening the conscript's bag on the Catalan's shoulders, "my brother, my only friend, don't get yourself killed, don't leave me alone in this world, where I cry and where I will be alone as soon as you are no longer there."
013.087 These words, said at the moment of departure, restored some hope to Fernand. If Dantes did not come back, Mercedes might one day be his.
013.088 Mercedes remained alone on this bare earth, which had never seemed so arid to her, and with the immense sea as her horizon. All bathed in tears, like that madwoman whose painful story we are told, one saw her wandering ceaselessly around the small village of the Catalans: Sometimes stopping under the burning sun of the Midi, standing motionless, mute as a statue, and looking at Marseilles; sometimes sitting at the edge of the shore, listening to that moan of the sea, eternal as her pain, and asking herself unceasingly if it were not better to lean forward, to let herself go under her own weight, to open the abyss and to be swallowed up in it, than to suffer thus all these cruel alternatives of a waiting without hope.
013.089 It was not courage that Mercédès lacked to accomplish this project; it was religion that came to her aid and saved her from suicide.
013.090 Caderousse was called, like Fernand; only, as he was eight years older than the Catalan, and married, he was only part of the third ban, and was sent to the coast.
013.091 The old Dantes, who had been sustained only by hope, lost hope at the fall of the emperor.
013.092 Five months to the day after he was separated from his son, and almost at the same time he was arrested, he breathed his last in the arms of Mercedes.
013.093 Mr. Morrel provided for all the expenses of his burial, and paid the poor little debts which the old man had incurred during his illness.
013.094 There was more than charity in doing this, there was courage. The Midi was on fire, and to help even on his deathbed the father of a Bonapartist as dangerous as Dantes was a crime.
014.000 The furious prisoner and the mad prisoner.
014.001 About a year after the return of Louis XVIII, there was a visit from the inspector general of prisons.
014.002 Dantes heard rolling and creaking from the depths of his dungeon all these preparations, which made a lot of noise above, but which, below, would have been unappreciable noises for any other ear than that of a prisoner, accustomed to listening, in the silence of the night, to the spider weaving its web, and to the periodic fall of the drop of water that takes an hour to form on the ceiling of his dungeon.
014.003 He guessed that something unusual was happening among the living: he had been living in a tomb for so long that he could well consider himself dead.
014.004 Indeed, the inspector visited, one after the other, rooms, cells and dungeons. Several prisoners were questioned: they were those whose gentleness or stupidity recommended them to the administration's benevolence; the inspector asked them how they were fed, and what complaints they had.
014.005 They unanimously replied that the food was detestable and that they wanted their freedom.
014.006 The inspector then asked them if they had anything else to tell him.
014.007 They shook their heads. What other good can prisoners ask for than freedom?
014.008 The inspector turned with a smile and said to the governor
014.009 "I don't know why they make us make these useless rounds. Whoever sees one prisoner sees a hundred; whoever hears one prisoner hears a thousand; it's always the same thing: malnourished and innocent. Do you have others?
014.010 -- Yes, we have the dangerous or insane prisoners, whom we keep in the dungeon.
014.011 -- Let's see," said the inspector with an air of deep weariness, "let's do our job to the end; let's go down to the dungeons.
014.012 --Wait, said the governor, let us at least go and get two men; prisoners sometimes commit, if only out of disgust for life and to be condemned to death, useless acts of despair: you could be the victim of one of these acts.
014.013 - Take precautions," said the inspector.
014.014 Indeed, two soldiers were sent for, and they began to descend a staircase so stinking, so foul, so musty, that just passing through such a place affected sight, smell and breathing unpleasantly.
014.015 "Oh," said the inspector, stopping halfway down the stairs, "who the hell is staying there?
014.016 --A most dangerous conspirator, and who is particularly recommended to us as a man capable of anything.
014.017 -- Is he alone?
014.018 --Certainly.
014.019 --How long has he been here?
014.020 --For about a year.
014.021 --And he was put in this dungeon as soon as he entered.
014.022 --No, sir, but after he tried to kill the key-bearer charged with carrying his food.
014.023 --He tried to kill the key-bearer?
014.024 --Yes, sir, the very one who is giving us light, isn't that true, Antoine?" asked the governor.
014.025 -- He wanted to kill me all the same, replied the key-bearer.
014.026 --Ah, but is this man a madman?
014.027 --Worse than that, said the key-holder, he is a demon.
014.028 --Do you want us to complain about him?" the inspector asked the governor.
014.029 -- Unnecessary, sir, he is punished enough as it is; besides, at present he is almost touching madness, and, according to the experience given us by our observations, before another year has passed he will be completely insane.
014.030 --My goodness, so much the better for him, said the inspector; once he is completely insane, he will suffer less."
014.031 He was, as we see, a man full of humanity, this inspector, and well worthy of the philanthropic functions he performed.
014.032 "You are right, sir," said the governor, "and your reflection proves that you have studied the matter deeply. Thus, we have in a dungeon, which is separated from this one by only twenty feet, and into which one descends by another staircase, an old abbot, a former party leader in Italy, who has been here since 1811, to whom his head turned towards the end of 1813, and who, since that time, is not physically recognizable: he wept, he laughed; he was thin, he grew fatter. Do you want to see him instead of this one? His madness is entertaining and will not sadden you.
014.033 --I will see them both," replied the inspector; "one must make one's statement in conscience."
014.034 The inspector was on his first tour and wanted to give a good account of himself to the authority.
014.035 "Let's go to this one first," he added.
014.036 --Willingly," replied the governor.
014.037 And he signaled to the key-holder, who opened the door.
014.038 At the creaking of the massive locks, at the cry of the rusty hinges turning on their pivots, Dantes, crouching in a corner of his dungeon, where he received with unspeakable happiness the thin ray of daylight that filtered through a narrow grilled window, raised his head. At the sight of an unknown man, illuminated by two key-bearers holding torches, and to whom the governor was speaking with his hat in his hand, accompanied by two soldiers, Dantes guessed what it was all about, and, seeing at last an opportunity to implore a higher authority, leaped forward with folded hands.
014.039 The soldiers immediately crossed their bayonets, for they believed that the prisoner was rushing toward the inspector with evil intentions.
014.040 The inspector himself took a step back.
014.041 Dantes saw that he had been presented as a man to be feared.
014.042 Then he gathered in his gaze all that the heart of man can contain of gentleness and humility, and expressing himself with a kind of pious eloquence that astonished those present, he tried to touch the soul of his visitor.
014.043 The inspector listened to Dantes's speech until the end, then turned to the governor:
014.044 "He will turn to devotion," he said half aloud; "he is already disposed to milder feelings. See, fear has its effect on him; he has shrunk from bayonets; now, a madman shrinks from nothing: I made some very curious observations on this subject at Charenton."
014.045 Then, turning back to the prisoner:
014.046 "In short," he said, "what do you ask?
014.047 --I ask what crime I have committed; I ask that I be given judges; I ask that my trial be investigated; finally, I ask that I be shot if I am guilty, but also that I be set free if I am innocent.
014.048 -- Are you well fed? asked the inspector.
014.049 -- Yes, I think so, I don't know. But that doesn't matter; what must matter, not only to me, the unfortunate prisoner, but also to all the officials who administer justice, and even to the king who governs us, is that an innocent man should not be the victim of an infamous denunciation and should not die under lock and key, cursing his executioners.
014.050 -- You are very humble today, said the governor; you have not always been like this. You spoke quite differently, my dear friend, the day you wanted to knock out your guard.
014.051 - "It is true, sir," said Dantes, "and I humbly beg the pardon of this man who has always been good to me. .... But, what do you want? I was mad, I was furious.
014.052 --And you are not mad anymore?
014.053 --No, sir, for captivity has bent me, broken me, destroyed me.... I've been here so long!
014.054 --So long?... and when were you arrested? asked the inspector.
014.055 --February 28, 1815, at two in the afternoon."
014.056 The inspector calculated.
014.057 "This is July 30, 1816; what are you saying? You have only been a prisoner for seventeen months.
014.058 --Only seventeen months!" said Dantes. Ah! You don't know what seventeen months in prison is: Seventeen years, seventeen centuries; especially for a man who, like me, was on the verge of happiness, for a man who, like me, was going to marry a beloved woman, for a man who saw an honorable career opening up before him, and to whom everything is instantly lost; who, in the middle of the most beautiful day, falls into the deepest night, who sees his career destroyed, who doesn't know if the woman who loved him still loves him, who doesn't know if his old father is dead or alive. Seventeen months in prison, for a man used to the sea air, to the independence of the sailor, to space, to immensity, to infinity! Sir, seventeen months in prison is more than all the crimes that human language calls by the most odious names deserve. Have pity on me, therefore, sir, and ask for me, not indulgence, but rigor; not a pardon, but a judgment; judges, sir, I ask only for judges; one cannot refuse judges to an accused.
014.059 -That's fine, said the inspector, we'll see."
014.060 Then, turning to the governor:
014.061 "Truly," he said, "the poor devil makes me feel sorry. When you come up, you will show me his book of escrow.
014.062 --Certainly, said the governor; but I think you will find some terrible notes against him.
014.063 --Sir," continued Dantes, "I know that you cannot get me out of here by your own decision; but you can pass on my request to the authorities, you can provoke an inquiry, you can, finally, have me put on trial: a trial is all I ask; that I may know what crime I have committed, and to what punishment I am condemned; for, you see, uncertainty is the worst of all torments.
014.064 -- Tell me," said the inspector.
014.065 -- Sir," cried Dantes, "I understand from the sound of your voice that you are moved. Sir, tell me to hope.
014.066 -- I cannot tell you that," replied the inspector, "I can only promise to examine your case.
014.067 -- Oh, then, sir, I am free, I am saved.
014.068 -- Who had you arrested?
014.069 --Mr. de Villefort, replied Dantes. See him and get along with him.
014.070 --Mr. de Villefort has not been in Marseille for a year, but in Toulouse.
014.071 --Ah, that doesn't surprise me anymore, murmured Dantes: my only protector is far away.
014.072 --Did Monsieur de Villefort have any reason to hate you?
014.073 --None, sir; and he was even kind to me.
014.074 -- So I can rely on the notes he has left on you or that he will give me?
014.075 -- Entirely, sir.
014.076 --That's good, wait."
014.077 Dantes fell to his knees, raising his hands to heaven, and murmuring a prayer in which he commended to God this man who had descended into his prison, like the Savior going to deliver the souls of hell.
014.078 The door closed again; but the hope that had descended with the inspector had remained locked in Dantes' dungeon.
014.079 "Do you want to see the register of the prisoner's case right now," asked the governor, "or do you want to go to the abbot's dungeon?
014.080 "Let's get rid of the dungeons at once," replied the inspector. If I went back to daylight, I might not have the courage to continue my sad mission.
014.081 --Ah, this one is not a prisoner like the other, and his madness is less saddening than the reason of his neighbor.
014.082 -- And what is his madness?
014.083 -- Oh, a strange madness: he believes himself the possessor of an immense treasure. In the first year of his captivity, he offered the government a million, if the government would set him free; in the second year, two million; in the third, three million; and so on. He is in his fifth year of captivity: he will ask you to speak to you in secret, and will offer you five million.
014.084 --Ah! ah! that is curious indeed, said the inspector; and what do you call this millionaire?
014.085 --Abbot Faria.
014.086 --No. 27! said the inspector.
014.087 --It's here. Open up, Antoine."
014.088 The key-bearer obeyed, and the inspector's curious glance plunged into the dungeon of the _abbé fou_.
014.089 This was the general name of the prisoner.
014.090 In the middle of the room, in a circle drawn on the ground with a piece of plaster detached from the wall, lay a man almost naked, so much had his clothes fallen to shreds. He was drawing very clear geometrical lines in this circle, and seemed as busy solving his problem as Archimedes was when he was killed by a soldier of Marcellus. So he did not move even at the sound of the dungeon door opening, and did not seem to wake up until the light of the torches shone with an unusual brightness on the damp floor on which he was working. Then he turned around and saw with astonishment the large company that had just descended into his dungeon.
014.091 Immediately he got up quickly, took a blanket thrown over the foot of his miserable bed, and hastily draped himself to appear in a more decent state to the eyes of strangers.
014.092 "What do you want?" said the inspector without varying his formula.
014.093 --Me, sir!" said the abbot with an astonished look; "I ask for nothing.
014.094 --You don't understand," said the inspector, "I am a government agent, I have a mission to go down to the prisons and listen to the prisoners' complaints.
014.095 -- "Oh, then, sir, that's something else," exclaimed the abbot, "and I hope we'll get along.
014.096 -- See," said the governor, "doesn't it begin as I told you it would?
014.097 --Sir, continued the prisoner, I am the abbot Faria, born in Rome, I was twenty years secretary of the cardinal Rospigliosi; I was arrested, I do not know too much why, towards the beginning of the year 1811, since this moment, I claim my freedom of the Italian and French authorities.
014.098 --Why from the French authorities? asked the governor.
014.099 --Because I was arrested in Piombino and I presume that, like Milan and Florence, Piombino has become the chief town of some French department."
014.100 The inspector and the governor looked at each other, laughing.
014.101 "Hell, my dear," said the inspector, "your news from Italy is not fresh.
014.102 -- "They date from the day I was arrested, sir," said Father Faria; "and as His Majesty the Emperor had created the kingship of Rome for the son whom heaven had just sent him, I presume that, pursuing the course of his conquests, he has fulfilled the dream of Machiavelli and Caesar Borgia, which was to make of all Italy a single kingdom.
014.103 -Sir," said the inspector, "Providence has fortunately brought about some change in this gigantic plan, of which you seem to me to be a fairly warm supporter.
014.104 --This is the only way to make Italy a strong, independent and happy state, replied the abbot.
014.105 --That is possible, replied the inspector, but I have not come here to give you a course in ultramontane politics, but to ask you what I have already done, if you have any complaints to make about the way in which you are fed and housed.
014.106 --The food is what it is in all prisons, answered the abbot, that is to say, very bad; as for the lodging, you see, it is damp and unhealthy, but nevertheless quite suitable for a dungeon. Now, it is not about that, but about revelations of the highest importance and interest that I have to make to the government.
014.107 -- Here we are, said the governor quietly to the inspector.
014.108 --That is why I am so happy to see you," continued the abbot, "although you have disturbed me in a very important calculation, which, if it succeeds, will perhaps change Newton's system. Can you grant me the favor of a private interview?
014.109 -- What was I saying?" said the governor to the inspector.
014.110 -- "You know your own person," replied the latter, smiling. Then, turning to Faria, he said
014.111 "Sir," he said, "what you are asking me is impossible.
014.112 "However, sir," continued the abbot, "if it were a question of making the government earn a huge sum, a sum of five million, for example?
014.113 --My goodness," said the inspector, turning back to the governor, "you predicted the figure.
014.114 -- Let's see," continued the abbot, realizing that the inspector was making a movement to withdraw, "it is not necessary for us to be absolutely alone; the governor will be able to attend our talk.
014.115 -My dear sir, said the governor, unfortunately we know in advance and by heart what you will say. It's about your treasures, isn't it?"
014.116 Faria looked at this scoffing man with eyes in which a disinterested observer would certainly have seen the flash of reason and truth shine.
014.117 "No doubt," he said, "what else do you want me to talk about?
014.118 "Mr. Inspector," continued the governor, "I can tell you this story as well as the abbot, for I have been hearing about it for four or five years.
014.119 -This proves, Mr. Governor," said the abbot, "that you are like those people of whom Scripture speaks, who have eyes and do not see, who have ears and do not hear.
014.120 -My dear sir," said the inspector, "the government is rich and has, thank God, no need of your money; so save it for the day when you get out of prison."
014.121 The abbot's eye dilated; he grasped the inspector's hand.
014.122 "But if I do not get out of prison," he said, "if, against all justice, I am kept in this dungeon, if I die there without having bequeathed my secret to anyone, then this treasure will be lost! Wouldn't it be better for the government to benefit from it, and me too? I will go as far as six million, sir; yes, I will give up six million, and I will be satisfied with the rest if they want to give me my freedom.
014.123 - "On my word," said the inspector half aloud, "if one did not know that this man is mad, he speaks with such a convinced accent that one would think he was telling the truth.
014.124 --I am not mad, sir, and I am telling the truth," said Faria, who, with that acute hearing peculiar to prisoners, had not lost a single word of the inspector. This treasure of which I speak to you really exists, and I offer to sign a treaty with you, by virtue of which you will take me to the place designated by me; the earth will be searched before our eyes, and if I lie, if nothing is found, if I am a madman, as you say, well! you will take me back to this same dungeon, where I shall remain eternally, and where I shall die without asking for anything more from you or from anyone."
014.125 The governor began to laugh.
014.126 "Is your treasure far away?" he asked.
014.127 -- About a hundred leagues from here," said Faria.
014.128 --That's not a bad idea, said the governor; if all the prisoners wanted to enjoy walking their guards for a hundred leagues, and if the guards consented to such a walk, it would be an excellent chance for the prisoners to take the key to the field as soon as they found the opportunity, and during such a trip the opportunity would certainly present itself.
014.129 -This is a known method, said the inspector, and the gentleman does not even have the merit of invention. Then, turning to the abbot, he said
014.130 "I asked you if you were well fed?
014.131 --Sir," replied Faria, "swear to me on Christ that you will deliver me if I have told you the truth, and I will show you the place where the treasure is buried.
014.132 -- Are you well fed? repeated the inspector.
014.133 --Sir, you are not risking anything in this way, and you can see that it is not to spare me a chance to save myself, since I will remain in prison while we make the trip.
014.134 --You are not answering my question," said the inspector impatiently.
014.135 -- Not you to my request!" cried the abbot. Damn you, then, like the other fools who would not believe me! You don't want my gold, I'll keep it; you refuse me freedom, God will send it to me. Go, I have nothing more to say."
014.136 And the abbot, throwing back his blanket, picked up his piece of plaster, and went and sat down again in the middle of his circle, where he continued his lines and calculations.
014.137 "What is he doing there?" said the inspector, withdrawing.
014.138 --He is counting his treasures," said the governor. Faria replied to this sarcasm with a look of supreme contempt.
014.139 They went out. The jailer closed the door behind them.
014.140 "He will, indeed, have possessed some treasures," said the inspector as he went up the stairs.
014.141 -- Or he will have dreamed that he possessed them," replied the governor, "and the next day he will have woken up mad.
014.142 --In effect, said the inspector with the naivety of corruption; if he had been really rich, he would not be in prison."
014.143 Thus ended the adventure for Abbot Faria. He remained a prisoner, and as a result of this visit his reputation as a jolly fool increased still further.
014.144 Caligula or Nero, those great seekers of treasure, those desirous of the impossible, would have listened to the words of this poor man and granted him the air he desired, the space he valued so highly, and the freedom he offered to pay so dearly. But the kings of our days, kept within the limits of the probable, no longer have the audacity of the will; they fear the ear that listens to the orders they give, the eye that scrutinizes their actions; they no longer feel the superiority of their divine essence; they are crowned men, that is all. Formerly, they believed themselves, or at least said they were sons of Jupiter, and retained something of the ways of their father god: one does not easily control what happens beyond the clouds; today, kings let themselves be easily reached. Now, as it has always been repugnant to the despotic government to show in broad daylight the effects of the prison and of the torture; Just as there are few examples of a victim of the inquisitions being able to reappear with his bones crushed and his wounds bleeding, so madness, that ulcer born in the mire of the dungeons as a result of moral torture, almost always hides itself carefully in the place where it was born, or, if it leaves, it goes to bury itself in some dark hospital, where the doctors recognize neither man nor thought in the shapeless wreckage that the tired jailer passes on to them.
014.145 Abbot Faria, who had gone mad in prison, was condemned, by his very madness, to a perpetual prison.
014.146 As for Dantes, the inspector kept his word. As he went up to the governor's house, he was shown the register of the prisoner's confinement. The note concerning the prisoner read as follows:
014.147 _Edmond Dantès: Enraged Bonapartist: took an active part in the return from Elba.
014.148 To be kept in the greatest secrecy and under the strictest surveillance.
014.149 This note was in a different handwriting and ink than the rest of the register, which proved that it had been added since Dantes' imprisonment.
014.150 The accusation was too positive to try to fight it. The inspector therefore wrote below the brace:
014.151 "Nothing to be done."
014.152 This visit had, so to speak, revived Dantes since he had entered prison; he had forgotten to count the days, but the inspector had given him a new date and Dantes had not forgotten it. Behind him he wrote on the wall, with a piece of plaster detached from his ceiling, July 30, 1816, and from that moment on he made a notch every day so that the measure of time would no longer escape him.
014.153 The days passed, then the weeks, then the months: Dantes was still waiting, he had begun by setting a term of fifteen days for his freedom. Putting half the interest he had seemed to have in following his case, the inspector must have had enough of fifteen days. These fifteen days passed, he said to himself that it was absurd for him to believe that the inspector would have taken care of him before his return to Paris; however, his return to Paris could not take place until his tour was finished, and his tour could last a month or two; he therefore gave himself three months instead of fifteen days. When the three months were up, another reasoning came to his aid, which made him give himself six months, but when these six months were up, putting the days at the end of each other, he found that he had waited ten and a half months. During these ten months, nothing had been changed in the regime of his prison; no consoling news had reached him; the jailer was mute, as usual. Dantes began to doubt his senses, to believe that what he took for a memory of his memory was nothing but a hallucination of his brain, and that this consoling angel who had appeared in his prison had descended there on the wing of a dream.
014.154 At the end of a year, the governor was changed; he had obtained the direction of the fort of Ham; he took with him several of his subordinates and, among others, Dantes' jailer. A new governor arrived; it would have been too long for him to learn the names of his prisoners, he only asked for their numbers. This horrible hotel consisted of fifty rooms; their inhabitants were called by the number of the room they occupied, and the unfortunate young man ceased to be called by his first name of Edmond or by his name of Dantes, he was called number 34.
015.000 Number 34 and number 27.
015.001 Dantes passed through all the stages of misfortune that prisoners forgotten in a prison undergo.
015.002 He began with pride, which is a continuation of hope and a consciousness of innocence; then he came to doubt his innocence, which not unfavorably justified the governor's ideas about insanity; finally he fell from the height of his pride, he prayed, not yet to God, but to men; God is the last resort. The unfortunate man, who should begin with the Lord, comes to hope in him only after having exhausted all other hopes.
015.003 Dantes therefore begged to be taken out of his dungeon and put into another, even if it was darker and deeper. A change, even a disadvantageous one, was always a change, and would provide Dantes with a few days' distraction. He begged for a walk, air, books, instruments. None of this was granted to him; but anyway, he always asked. He had become accustomed to talking to his new jailer, although he was still, if possible, more mute than the old one; but talking to a man, even to a mute, was still a pleasure. Dantes spoke to hear the sound of his own voice: he had tried to speak when he was alone, but then he frightened himself.
015.004 Often, while he was at liberty, Dantes had made himself a scarecrow of those prisoners' barracks, composed of vagabonds, bandits, and murderers, whose ignoble joys put together unintelligible orgies and frightening friendships. He came to wish that he had been thrown into one of these slums, in order to see faces other than that of this impassive jailer who would not speak; he missed the prison with its infamous costume, its chain at the foot, its scourge on the shoulder. At least the galley slaves were in the society of their fellow men, they breathed the air, they saw the sky; the galley slaves were quite happy.
015.005 One day he begged the gaoler to ask for a companion, whoever he might be, even if it was the mad abbot he had heard about. Under the jailer's bark, however rough it may be, there always remains a little of the man. This one had often, from the bottom of his heart, and although his face did not say anything about it, pitied this unfortunate young man, to whom the captivity was so hard; he transmitted the request of number 34 to the governor; but this one, prudent as if he had been a political man, figured that Dantes wanted to stir up the prisoners, to plot some plot, to help himself of a friend in some attempt of escape, and he refused.
015.006 Dantes had exhausted the circle of human resources. As we have said, this had to happen, so he turned to God.
015.007 All the pious ideas scattered throughout the world, and gleaned by the unfortunate ones bent by destiny, came to refresh his mind; he remembered the prayers his mother had taught him, and found in them a meaning previously unknown to him; for, for the happy man, prayer remains a monotonous and meaningless assemblage, until the day when sorrow comes to explain to the unfortunate one that sublime language by means of which he speaks to God
015.008 So he prayed, not with fervor, but with rage. When he prayed aloud, he was no longer afraid of his words; then he fell into a kind of ecstasy; he saw God bursting forth at every word he uttered; all the actions of his humble and lost life he related to the will of this powerful God, made lessons of them, proposed tasks to himself, and at the end of each prayer slipped in the self-interested wish that men find much more often a way to address to men than to God And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
015.009 Despite his fervent prayers, Dantes remained a prisoner.
015.010 Then his mind became dark, a cloud thickened before his eyes. Dantes was a simple, uneducated man; the past had remained for him covered with that dark veil which science lifts. He could not, in the solitude of his dungeon and in the desert of his thought, reconstruct the past ages, bring back the extinct peoples, rebuild the ancient cities, which the imagination magnifies and poeticizes, and which pass before the eyes, gigantic and illuminated by the fire of the sky, like Martinn's Babylonian paintings; he had only his past so short, his present so dark, his future so dubious: nineteen years of light to meditate upon, perhaps, in an eternal night! No distraction could help him: his energetic mind, which would have liked nothing better than to fly through the ages, was forced to remain prisoner like an eagle in a cage. He clung to one idea, that of his happiness destroyed without apparent cause and by an unheard-of fatality; he stubbornly clung to this idea, turning it over and over, and devouring it, so to speak, with his teeth, as in Dante's Inferno the merciless Ugolino devours the skull of Archbishop Roger. Dantes had only had a passing faith, based on power; he lost it as others lose it after success. Only he had not profited.
015.011 Rage succeeded asceticism. Edmond hurled blasphemies that made the jailer recoil in horror; he broke his body against the walls of his prison; he lashed out with fury at everything around him, and especially at himself, at the slightest annoyance that a grain of sand, a piece of straw, a breath of air caused him. Then that denunciatory letter which he had seen, which Villefort had shown him, which he had touched, came back to his mind, each line blazing on the wall like Balthazar's _Mane, Thecel, Pharès_. He told himself that it was the hatred of men and not the vengeance of God that had plunged him into the abyss in which he was; he dedicated these unknown men to all the torments of which his ardent imagination supplied him with the idea, and he still found the most terrible ones too sweet and above all too short for them; for after the torment came death; and in death was, if not rest, at least the insensibility that resembles it.
015.012 By dint of saying to himself, in connection with his enemies, that calm was death, and that to one who wants to punish cruelly other means are needed than death, he fell into the dreary immobility of ideas of suicide; woe to him who, on the slope of misfortune, stops at these dark ideas! It is one of these dead seas which extend like the azure of pure waves, but in which the swimmer feels more and more his feet getting stuck in a bituminous mud which attracts him to it, sucks him in, swallows him up. Once he is caught in this way, if divine help does not come to his aid, everything is over, and every effort he makes pushes him further into death.
015.013 However, this state of moral agony is less terrible than the suffering that preceded it and the punishment that will perhaps follow it; it is a kind of dizzying consolation that shows you the gaping abyss, but at the bottom of the abyss nothingness. Once there, Edmond found some consolation in this idea; all his pains, all his sufferings, this procession of spectres that they trailed in their wake, seemed to fly away from this corner of his prison where the angel of death could put his silent foot. Dantes looked with calm at his past life, with terror at his future life, and chose this middle point which seemed to him to be a place of asylum.
015. 014 "Sometimes," he said to himself then, "in my distant travels, when I was still a man, and when that man, free and powerful, was issuing commands to other men that were being carried out, I saw the sky become overcast, the sea quiver and roar, the storm arise in a corner of the sky, and like a gigantic eagle beat the two horizons with its two wings; Then I felt that my ship was no longer but a powerless refuge, because my ship, light as a feather in the hand of a giant, trembled and shivered itself. Soon, with the frightful noise of the waves, the aspect of the sharp rocks announced death to me, and death frightened me; I made all my efforts to escape from it, and I joined all the forces of the man and all the intelligence of the sailor to fight with God!... It is that I was happy then, it is that to come back to life was to come back to happiness; it is that this death, I had not called it, I had not chosen it; it is that sleep finally seemed to me hard on this bed of seaweed and pebbles; it is that I was indignant, I who believed myself a creature made in the image of God to serve, after my death, as a pasture for the gulls and the vultures. But today it is something else: I have lost all that could make me love life, today death smiles on me like a nurse to the child she is going to cradle; but today I die as I please, and I fall asleep weary and broken, as I used to fall asleep after one of those evenings of despair and rage during which I had counted three thousand laps around my room, that is to say, thirty thousand steps, that is to say, about ten leagues."
015.015 As soon as this thought had germinated in the young man's mind, he became gentler, more smiling; he arranged himself better with his hard bed and black bread, ate less, slept no more, and found this remnant of existence more or less bearable, which he was sure to leave there when he wished, as one leaves a worn-out garment.
015.016 There were two ways to die: one was simple, to tie his handkerchief to a window bar and hang himself; the other was to pretend to eat and let himself die of hunger. The first was very repugnant to Dantes. He had been brought up to abhor pirates, people who are hanged from the yards of ships; hanging was therefore for him a kind of infamous punishment which he did not want to apply to himself; he therefore adopted the second, and began its execution that very day.
015.017 Nearly four years had passed in the alternatives we have narrated. At the end of the second, Dantes had stopped counting the days and had fallen back into that ignorance of time from which the inspector had once drawn him.
015.018 Dantes had said: "I want to die" and had chosen his kind of death; then he had considered it well, and for fear of going back on his decision, he had sworn to himself that he would die like that. When my morning and evening meals are served, he thought, I will throw the food out of the window and look as if I have eaten it.
015.019 He did this as he had promised himself he would do. Twice a day, through the small grilled opening that let him see only the sky, he threw out his food, first cheerfully, then thoughtfully, then regretfully; it took the memory of the oath he had made to himself to give him the strength to carry out this terrible plan. These foods, which used to be repugnant to him, hunger, with its sharp teeth, made them appear appetizing to the eye and exquisite to the smell; sometimes he would hold the dish that contained it in his hand for an hour, his eye fixed on that piece of rotten meat or on that vile fish, and on that black and moldy bread. It was the last instincts of life that were still fighting in him and that from time to time overcame his resolution. Then his dungeon did not seem so dark to him, his state seemed less desperate; he was still young; he must have been twenty-five or twenty-six years old, he had fifty years left to live, that is to say twice what he had lived. During this immense lapse of time, how many events could force the doors, overthrow the walls of the Château d'If and return it to freedom! Then, he approached his teeth of the meal that, voluntary Tantalus, he himself removed from his mouth; but then the memory of his oath returned to him, and this generous nature was too afraid to despise itself to fail in its oath. So he used up, rigorously and ruthlessly, the little existence that remained to him, and one day he no longer had the strength to get up and throw out of the skylight the supper that was brought to him.
015.020 The next day he could no longer see, he could hardly hear. The jailer believed that he was seriously ill; Edmond hoped that he would die soon.
015.021 The day went on like that: Edmond felt a vague numbness, which did not lack a certain well-being, overtake him. When he closed his eyes, he saw a crowd of bright lights like the will-o'-the-wisps that run through the mirey ground at night: it was the twilight of that unknown country called death. Suddenly in the evening, around nine o'clock, he heard a thud on the wall against which he was lying.
015.022 So many foul animals had come to make their noise in this prison that, little by little, Edmond had accustomed his sleep not to be disturbed by so little; but this time, either his senses were heightened by abstinence, or the noise was really louder than usual, or in this supreme moment everything acquired importance, Edmond lifted his head to hear better.
015.023 It was an even scratching that seemed to indicate either a huge claw, or a powerful tooth, or the pressure of some instrument on stones.
015.024 Although weakened, the brain of the young man was struck by this banal idea constantly present to the mind of the prisoners: freedom. This sound came so just at the moment when all noise was about to cease for him, that it seemed to him that God was at last showing himself pitiful to his sufferings and sending him this sound to warn him to stop at the edge of the grave where his foot was already wobbling. Who could know whether one of his friends, one of those beloved beings of whom he had thought so often that he had worn out his thoughts, was not looking after him at this moment and trying to close the distance that separated them?
015.025 But no, undoubtedly Edmond was mistaken, and it was one of those dreams which float at the door of death.
015.026 However, Edmund still listened to the noise. This noise lasted for about three hours, and then Edmund heard a sort of crunching, after which the noise ceased.
015.027 A few hours later it started again, louder and closer together. Edmund was already interested in this work, which made him feel at home; suddenly the jailer entered.
015.028 For about eight days since he had resolved to die, four days since he had begun to carry out this plan, Edmund had not spoken to this man, not answering him when he had spoken to him to ask him what disease he thought he had, and turning away from the wall when he was looked at too closely. But today, the jailer could hear this dull rustling, be alarmed by it, put an end to it, and thus perhaps disturb that je ne sais quoi of hope, the idea of which alone charmed the last moments of Dantes.
015.029 The jailer brought lunch.
015.030 Dantes got up on his bed, and, raising his voice, began to talk about every possible subject, about the poor quality of the food he was bringing, about the cold from which one suffered in that dungeon, murmuring and scolding to have the right to shout louder, and wearing out the patience of the gaoler, who just that day had asked for fresh broth and bread for the sick prisoner, and who was bringing him this broth and bread.
015.031 Fortunately, he thought that Dantes was delirious; he put the food on the bad, lame table on which he was accustomed to place it, and withdrew.
015.032 Free then, Edmond began to listen again with joy.
015.033 The noise became so distinct that now the young man could hear it without effort.
015.034 "No more doubt," he said to himself, "since this noise continues, despite the day, it is some unfortunate prisoner like me who is working for his deliverance. Oh, if I were near him, how I would help him!"
015.035 Then, suddenly, a dark cloud passed over this dawn of hope in this brain accustomed to misfortune and which could only with difficulty recover itself to human joys; this idea arose at once, that this noise had for its cause the work of some workmen whom the governor employed in the repairs of a neighboring room.
015.036 It was easy to be sure of this; but how to risk a question? Of course, it was quite simple to wait for the arrival of the jailer, to make him listen to this noise, and to see the look on his face when he heard it; but to give oneself such a satisfaction, was it not to betray very precious interests for a very short satisfaction? Unfortunately, Edmond's head, an empty bell, was deafened by the hum of an idea; he was so weak that his mind floated like a vapor, and could not condense around a thought. Edmund saw only one way to restore sharpness to his reflection and lucidity to his judgment; he turned his eyes to the still-smoking broth which the jailer had just placed on the table, rose, went staggering to it, took the cup, brought it to his lips, and swallowed the beverage it contained with an inexpressible sensation of well-being.
015.037 Then he had the courage to leave it at that: he had heard that unfortunate castaways who had been taken in, exhausted by hunger, had died for having gluttonously devoured too substantial a food. Edmond put the bread he was already holding almost within reach of his mouth on the table, and went back to bed. Edmund did not want to die anymore.
015.038 Soon he felt that daylight was returning to his brain; all his ideas, vague and almost elusive, resumed their place in that marvelous chessboard, where one more square perhaps is enough to establish the superiority of man over animals. He was able to think and strengthen his thought with reasoning.
015.039 Then he said to himself:
015.040 "We must try the test, but without compromising anyone. If the worker is an ordinary worker, I need only knock on my wall, and he will immediately stop his work and try to guess who is knocking and for what purpose. But since his work will not only be lawful, but also ordered, he will soon resume his work. If, on the other hand, he is a prisoner, the noise I make will frighten him; he will fear to be discovered; he will cease his work and will not resume it until this evening, when he believes everyone to be asleep."
015.041 Immediately Edmond rose again. This time his legs no longer wobbled and his eyes were without glare. He went to a corner of his prison, loosened a moisture-undermined stone, and returned to strike the wall at the very spot where the ringing was most noticeable.
015.042 He struck three times.
015.043 From the first, the noise had stopped, as if by magic.
015.044 Edmond listened with all his soul. An hour passed, two hours passed, no new noise was heard; Edmond had created absolute silence on the other side of the wall.
015.045 Full of hope, Edmond ate a few mouthfuls of his bread, swallowed a few gulps of water, and, thanks to the powerful constitution with which nature had endowed him, found himself more or less as before.
015.046 The day passed, and the silence continued.
015.047 The night came without the noise having started again.
015.048 "He's a prisoner," Edmund said to himself with unspeakable joy.
015.049 From then on his head was on fire, his life returned to him, violent from being active.
015.050 The night passed without the slightest sound being heard.
015.051 Edmund did not close his eyes that night.
015.052 Daylight returned, and the jailer returned with the provisions. Edmund had already devoured the old food; He devoured the new ones, listening incessantly to the sound that did not return, trembling that it had ceased for ever, going ten or twelve leagues in his dungeon, shaking the iron bars of his window for hours on end, restoring elasticity and vigor to his limbs by an exercise long since unlearned, and preparing at last to take up his destiny with his body, as the wrestler who is about to enter the arena does by stretching out his arms and rubbing his body with oil. Then, in the intervals of this feverish activity he listened to see if the noise did not return, becoming impatient with the prudence of this prisoner who did not guess that he had been distracted in his work of freedom by another prisoner, who was at least as anxious to be free as he.
015.053 Three days passed, seventy-two deadly hours counted minute by minute!
015.054 At last one evening, as the jailer had just made his last visit, as Dantes was sticking his ear to the wall for the hundredth time, it seemed to him that an imperceptible tremor was answering muffled in his head, which was connected with the silent stones.
015.055 Dantes stepped back to straighten his shaken brain, made a few turns around the room, and put his ear back on the same spot.
015.056 There was no longer any doubt that something was being done on the other side; the prisoner had recognized the danger of his maneuver and had adopted some other, and, no doubt to continue his work with greater safety, he had substituted the lever for the chisel.
015.057 Emboldened by this discovery, Edmund resolved to help the indefatigable worker. He began by moving his bed, behind which it seemed to him that the work of deliverance was being accomplished, and searched with his eyes for an object with which he could cut into the wall, knock out the wet cement, and finally loosen a stone.
015.058 Nothing presented itself to his sight. He had no knife or sharp instrument; only iron on his bars, and he had so often made sure that his bars were well sealed that it was no longer worth trying to shake them.
015.059 For furniture, a bed, a chair, a table, a bucket, a jug.
015.060 On this bed there were iron tenons, but these tenons were sealed to the wood with screws. It would have taken a screwdriver to pull out these screws and tear out these tenons.
015.061 The table and the chair had nothing; the bucket had once had a handle, but the handle had been removed.
015.062 There was only one resource left for Dantes, and that was to break his jug and, with one of the pieces of sandstone cut at an angle, to set to work.
015.063 He dropped the pitcher on a pavement, and the pitcher shattered.
015.064 Dantes chose two or three sharp splinters, hid them in his straw mattress, and left the others scattered on the ground. The breakage of his jug was too natural an accident to worry about.
015.065 Edmond had all night to work; but in the darkness the work went badly, for he had to grope, and he soon felt that he was dulling the shapeless instrument against a harder sandstone. So he pushed back his bed and waited for the day. With hope, patience had returned to him.
015.066 All night long he listened and heard the unknown miner who continued his underground work.
015.067 The day came, the jailer entered. Dantes told him that while drinking from the jug the day before, it had slipped out of his hand and broken as it fell. The jailer went grumblingly to fetch a new jug, without even bothering to take away the pieces of the old one.
015.068 He returned a moment later, recommended more skill to the prisoner and left.
015.069 Dantes listened with unspeakable joy to the creaking of the lock, which, every time it closed, squeezed his heart. He listened to the sound of footsteps, then when the sound had died away, he jumped up to his bunk, which he moved, and, in the light of the faint ray of daylight that penetrated his dungeon, could see the useless work he had done the night before, addressing the body of the stone instead of the plaster that surrounded its ends.
015.070 Humidity had made this plaster brittle.
015.071 Dantes saw with a joyful heartbeat that this plaster was coming off in fragments; these fragments were almost atoms, it is true; but after half an hour, however, Dantes had detached a handful of them. A mathematician could have calculated that with about two years of this work, supposing that the rock was not encountered, a passage of two feet square and twenty feet deep could be dug.
015.072 The prisoner then reproached himself for not having used those long hours, successively slower and slower, which he had lost in hope, in prayer, and in despair, for this work.
015.073 In the six years or so that he had been locked up in that dungeon, what work, however slow, he had not completed!
015.074 And this idea gave him a new ardor.
015.075 In three days he managed, with unprecedented care, to remove all the cement and expose the stone: the wall was made of rubble, in the middle of which, to add to its solidity, a stone had been placed from time to time. It was one of these ashlars that he had almost loosened, and that it was now a question of shaking in its socket.
015.076 Dantes tried with his fingernails, but his fingernails were insufficient for that.
015.077 The pieces of the pitcher introduced in the intervals broke when Dantes wanted to use it as a lever.
015.078 After an hour of useless attempts, Dantes got up, sweat and anguish on his forehead.
015.079 Was he to be stopped in this way from the start, and would he have to wait, inert and useless, until his neighbor, who might have grown weary, had done everything!
015.080 Then an idea passed through his mind; he remained standing and smiling; his sweaty forehead dried itself.
015.081 Every day the jailer brought Dantes' soup in a tin pot. This pan contained his soup and that of a second prisoner, for Dantes had noticed that this pan was either entirely full or half empty, depending on whether the key-holder began the distribution of food by him or by his companion.
015.082 This pan had an iron handle; it was this iron handle that Dantes wanted, and which he would have paid for with ten years of his life if it had been demanded in exchange.
015.083 The jailer poured the contents of this pan into Dantes' plate. After eating his soup with a wooden spoon, Dantes washed this plate, which was used in this way every day.
015.084 In the evening Dantes placed his plate on the floor, halfway from the door to the table; the jailer, on entering, put his foot on the plate and broke it into a thousand pieces.
015.085 This time there was nothing to say against Dantes: he had been wrong to leave his plate on the floor, it is true, but the jailer had been wrong not to look at his feet.
015.086 So the jailer was content to grumble.
015.087 Then he looked around to see what he could pour the soup into; Dantes' furniture was limited to this one plate, there was no choice.
015.088 "Leave the pot," said Dantes, "you will take it back when you bring me my lunch tomorrow."
015.089 This advice flattered the laziness of the jailer, who thus had no need to go up, down and up again.
015.090 He left the pan.
015.091 Dantes shivered with joy.
015.092 This time he ate the soup and the meat that, according to the prison custom, was put with the soup. Then, after waiting an hour, to be sure that the jailer would not change his mind, he disturbed his bed, took his saucepan, inserted the end of the handle between the cementless stone and the neighboring rubble, and began to make the lever.
015.093 A slight oscillation proved to Dantes that the work was well done.
015.094 Indeed, at the end of one hour, the stone was drawn from the wall, where it made an excavation of more than one foot and half in diameter.
015.095 Dantes carefully picked up all the plaster, carried it to the corners of his prison, scraped away the grayish earth with one of the fragments of his jug, and covered the plaster with earth.
015.096 Then, wanting to make the most of that night when chance, or rather the clever combination he had devised, had put such a valuable instrument into his hands, he continued digging furiously.
015.097 At daybreak he put the stone back in its hole, pushed his bed against the wall and went to bed.
015.098 Breakfast consisted of a piece of bread; the jailer came in and put the piece of bread on the table.
015.099 "Well, aren't you bringing me another plate?" asked Dantes.
015.100 --No, said the key-holder; you are a breaker, you have destroyed your jug, and you are the cause that I have broken your plate; if all the prisoners did as much damage, the government could not stand it. We'll leave you the pot, and we'll pour your soup into it; that way you won't break your household, perhaps."
015.101 Dantès looked up to heaven and joined his hands under his blanket. This piece of iron which remained to him caused a more lively impulse of gratitude to heaven in his heart than had ever been caused in his past life by the greater goods which had come to him.
015.102 Only he had noticed that since he had begun to work, he, the prisoner, no longer worked.
015.103 However, this was not a reason to stop working; if his neighbor did not come to him, he would go to his neighbor.
015.104 All day long he worked tirelessly; by evening he had pulled more than ten handfuls of rubble, plaster and cement from the wall with his new tool.
015.105 When the hour of the visit arrived, he straightened as best he could the twisted handle of his pan and put the vessel back in its accustomed place. The key-bearer poured in the usual ration of soup and meat, or rather soup and fish, for that day was a lean day, and three times a week the prisoners were made to do lean. This would have been another way of calculating time, if Dantes had not long since abandoned this calculation.
015.106 Then, when the soup had been poured, the key-holder withdrew. This time Dantes wanted to be sure that his neighbor had really stopped working.
015.107 He listened.
015.108 Everything was silent, as it had been during the three days when work had been interrupted.
015.109 Dantes sighed; it was obvious that his neighbor was suspicious of him.
015.110 However, he did not lose heart and continued to work all night; but after two or three hours of toil, he encountered an obstacle. The iron was no longer biting and was sliding on a flat surface.
015.111 Dantes touched the obstacle with his hands and recognized that he had hit a beam.
015.112 This beam crossed or rather completely blocked the hole that Dantes had started.
015.113 Now it was necessary to dig over or under it.
015.114 The unfortunate young man had not thought of this obstacle.
015.115 "Oh, my God, my God!" he cried, "I had prayed to you so much that I hoped you had heard me. My God! after having taken away the freedom of life, my God! after having taken away the calm of death, my God! who has called me back into existence, my God! have mercy on me, do not let me die in despair!
015.116 --Who speaks of God and despair at the same time?" articulated a voice that seemed to come from beneath the earth and that, muffled by the opacity, reached the young man with a sepulchral accent.
015.117 Edmund felt his hair stand on end and he fell back on his knees.
015.118 "Ah," he murmured, "I hear a man talking."
015.119 It had been four or five years since Edmund had heard anything but his jailer speak, and to the prisoner the jailer is not a man: he is a living door added to his oak door; he is a bar of flesh added to his iron bars.
015.120 "In the name of Heaven!" cried Dantes, "you who have spoken, speak again, though your voice has frightened me; who are you?
015.121 --Who are you?" asked the voice.
015.122 -- An unfortunate prisoner," said Dantes, who had no difficulty in answering.
015.123 --From what country?
015.124 --French.
015.125 --Your name?
015.126 --Edmond Dantes.
015.127 --Your profession?
015.128 --Marine.
015.129 --How long have you been here?
015.130 --Since February 28, 1815.
015.131 --Your crime?
015.132 --I am innocent.
015.133 --But what are you accused of?
015.134 --Having conspired for the return of the Emperor.
015.135 --How can I conspire for the return of the Emperor? Is the Emperor no longer on the throne?
015.136 -- He abdicated at Fontainebleau in 1814 and was relegated to the island of Elba. But you yourself, how long have you been here that you know nothing about all this?
015.137 --Since 1811."
015.138 Dantes shuddered; this man was four years older than he was in prison.
015.139 "That's fine, don't dig anymore," said the voice, speaking very quickly; "just tell me how high the excavation you made is?
015.140 --At ground level.
015.141 --How is it hidden?
015.142 --Behind my bed.
015.143 --Has your bed been disturbed since you were in prison?
015.144 --Never.
015.145 --What does your room look like?
015.146 --Over a corridor.
015.147 --And the corridor?
015.148 --About the courtyard.
015.149 -- Alas! whispered the voice.
015.150 --Oh, my God! what is it?" cried Dantes.
015.151 --It is that I have made a mistake, that the imperfection of my drawings has deceived me, that the defect of a compass has lost me, that one line of error on my plan has been equivalent to fifteen feet in reality, and that I have taken the wall that you are digging for that of the citadel!
015.152 --But then you ended up at the sea?
015.153 --That was what I wanted.
015.154 --And if you had succeeded!
015.155 -- I would swim out to one of the islands around the Château d'If, either the island of Daume, or the island of Tiboulen, or even the coast, and then I would be saved.
015.156 - Could you have swum there?
015.157 - God would have given me the strength, and now all is lost.
015.158 --All?
015.159 -- Yes. Fill up your hole carefully, don't work anymore, don't worry about anything, and wait to hear from me.
015.160 -- Who are you at least... tell me who you are?
015.161 -- I am... I am... number 27.
015.162 -- Do you not trust me?" asked Dantes.
015.163 Edmond thought he heard a bitter laughter pierce the vault and rise up to him.
015.164 "Oh! I am a good Christian," he cried, instinctively guessing that this man was thinking of abandoning him; "I swear to you on Christ that I will have myself killed rather than let your executioners and mine catch a glimpse of the truth; but, in the name of Heaven, do not deprive me of your presence, do not deprive me of your voice, or, I swear to you, for I am at the end of my strength, I will break my head against the wall, and you will have my death to blame.
015.165 -- How old are you? Your voice sounds like that of a young man.
015.166 -- I do not know my age, for I have not measured the time since I have been here. What I do know is that I was about to turn nineteen when I was arrested on February 18, 1815.
015.167 --Not quite twenty-six, the voice murmured. Come on, at that age one is not yet a traitor.
015.168 --Oh, no! no! I swear to you," repeated Dantes. I have already told you, and I tell you again, that I would rather have myself cut in pieces than betray you.
015.169 -- You did well to speak to me; you did well to beg me, for I was going to form another plan and go away from you. But your age reassures me, I will join you, wait for me.
015.170 -- When?
015.171 -- I have to calculate our chances; let me give you the signal.
015.172 -- But you will not abandon me, you will not leave me alone, you will come to me, or you will allow me to come to you? We will flee together, and if we cannot flee, we will talk, you about the people you love, I about the people I love. You must love someone?
015.173 -- I am alone in the world.
015.174 --Then you will love me: if you are young, I will be your comrade; if you are old, I will be your son. I have a father who must be seventy years old, if he is still alive; I loved only him and a young girl called Mercedes. My father has not forgotten me, I am sure; but she, God knows, still thinks of me. I will love you as I loved my father.
015.175 -That's fine, said the prisoner, see you tomorrow."
015.176 These few words were said with an accent that convinced Dantes; he asked no more, got up, took the same precautions for the debris pulled from the wall that he had already taken, and pushed his bed back against the wall.
015.177 From then on, Dantes let himself go entirely to his happiness; he was certainly no longer going to be alone, perhaps he was even going to be free; the worst thing, if he remained a prisoner, was to have a companion; but shared captivity is no more than half a captivity. Complaints that are shared are almost prayers; prayers that are said in pairs are almost thanksgiving.
015.178 All day long, Dantes went back and forth in his dungeon, his heart leaping with joy. From time to time, this joy suffocated him: he sat down on his bed, pressing his chest with his hand. At the slightest noise he heard in the corridor, he would jump to the door. Once or twice, this fear that he would be separated from this man he did not know, and yet whom he already loved like a friend, passed through his mind. Then he made up his mind: the moment the jailer moved his bed aside, lowered his head to examine the opening, he would break his head with the pavement on which his jug was placed.
015.179 He would be condemned to death, he knew; but would he not die of boredom and despair at the very moment when that miraculous sound had brought him back to life?
015.180 In the evening the jailer came; Dantes was on his bed, and from there it seemed to him that he had a better view of the unfinished opening. No doubt he looked at the unwelcome visitor with a strange eye, for the latter said to him:
015.181 "Let's see, are you going to go crazy again?"
015.182 Dantes answered nothing; he feared that the emotion in his voice would betray him.
015.183 The jailer withdrew, shaking his head.
015.184 When night came, Dantes thought that his neighbor would take advantage of the silence and darkness to renew the conversation with him, but he was mistaken; the night passed without any sound answering his feverish expectation. But the next day, after the morning visit, and as he had just moved his bed away from the wall, he heard three knocks at equal intervals; he rushed to his knees.
015.185 "Is that you?" he said; "here I am!
015.186 --Is your jailer gone?" asked the voice.
015.187 --Yes, answered Dantes, he will not return until this evening, we have twelve hours of freedom.
015.188 --So I can act? said the voice.
015.189 --Oh, yes, yes, without delay, at once, I beg you."
015. 190 Immediately the portion of earth on which Dantes, half lost in the opening, was leaning with both hands seemed to give way under him; he threw himself back, while a mass of earth and loose stones rushed into a hole which had just opened below the opening which he himself had made; then, at the bottom of this dark hole, the depth of which he could not measure, he saw a head, shoulders, and at last a whole man appear, who came out of the excavation made with sufficient agility.
016.000 An Italian scholar.
016.001 Dantes took in his arms this new friend, so long and impatiently awaited, and drew him towards his window, so that the little daylight that penetrated the dungeon would illuminate it all.
016.002 He was a small man, with hair bleached by sorrow rather than by age, with a penetrating eye hidden under thick eyebrows that were turning gray, with a beard that was still black and reached down to his chest: the thinness of his face, hollowed out by deep wrinkles, the bold line of his characteristic features, revealed a man more accustomed to exercising his moral faculties than his physical strength. The forehead of the newcomer was covered with sweat.
016.003 As for his clothing, it was impossible to distinguish its original form, for it was falling apart.
016.004 He appeared to be at least sixty-five years old, although a certain vigor in his movements indicated that he was perhaps less old than a long captivity would indicate.
016.005 He welcomed with a kind of pleasure the enthusiastic protestations of the young man; his icy soul seemed, for a moment, to warm up and melt at the contact of this ardent soul. He thanked him for his cordiality with a certain warmth, although his disappointment was great in finding a second dungeon where he thought he would meet with freedom.
016.006 "Let us see first," he said, "if there is any way to make the traces of my passage disappear from the eyes of your jailers. All our future tranquility lies in their ignorance of what has happened."
016.007 Then he bent down to the opening, picked up the stone, which he lifted easily despite its weight, and pushed it into the hole.
016.008 "This stone was loosened quite carelessly," he said, shaking his head, "so you have no tools?
016.009 -- And you," asked Dantes with astonishment, "do you have any?
016.010 -- I have made some for myself. Except for a file, I have everything I need, chisels, pliers, and a lever.
016.011 -- Oh, I would be curious to see these products of your patience and your industry, said Dantes.
016.012 --Here is a chisel first."
016.013 And he showed her a strong, sharp blade fitted into a piece of beech wood.
016.014 "What did you use to make this?" said Dantes.
016.015 --With one of the pins of my bed. It is with this instrument that I dug myself all the way here; fifty feet or so.
016.016 --Fifty feet!" cried Dantes with a sort of terror.
016.017 --Speak lower, young man, speak lower; it often happens that one listens at the doors of prisoners.
016.018 -- They know I am alone.
016.019 -- Whatever.
016.020 --And you say you have walked fifty feet to get here?
016.021 -- Yes, that is about the distance that separates my room from yours; only I miscalculated my curve, for lack of a geometric instrument to draw up my scale of proportions; instead of forty feet of ellipse, I found fifty; I thought, as I told you, that I would reach the outer wall, pierce it and throw myself into the sea. I went along the corridor, against which your room gives, instead of passing under it; all my work is lost, because this corridor gives on a court full of guards.
016.022 --That's true, said Dantes; but this corridor runs along only one side of my room, and my room has four.
016.023 --Yes, no doubt, but here is one of which the rock makes the wall; it would take ten years of work for ten miners equipped with all their tools to pierce the rock; this other must be leaning against the foundations of the governor's apartment; we would fall into the cellars which obviously lock up and we would be caught; the other face gives, wait, where does the other face give?
016.024 This face was the one where the loophole was pierced through which came the day: this loophole, which was always narrowing until it gave entry to the day, and through which a child could certainly not have passed, was moreover furnished by three rows of iron bars which could reassure the most suspicious jailer about the fear of an escape by this means.
016.025 And the newcomer, making this question, dragged the table below the window.
016.026 "Get on that table" he said to Dantes.
016.027 Dantes obeyed, climbed on the table, and, guessing the intentions of his companion, leaned his back against the wall and presented him with both hands.
016. 028 The one who had given himself the name of the number of his room, and whose true name Dantes did not yet know, then climbed more lightly than his age could have foreshadowed, with the skill of a cat or a lizard, first on the table, then from the table onto Dantes' hands, then from his hands onto his shoulders; Thus bent in two, because the vault of the dungeon prevented him from righting himself, he slipped his head between the first row of bars, and could then plunge up and down.
016.029 A moment later he quickly withdrew his head.
016.030 "Oh, oh," he said, "I thought so.
016.031 And he let himself slide down Dantes' body onto the table, and from the table jumped to the ground.
016.032 "What did you suspect?" asked the anxious young man, jumping to his side.
016.033 The old prisoner pondered.
016.034 "Yes," he said, "that's it; the fourth face of your dungeon opens onto an outer gallery, a sort of walkway where the patrols pass and where sentries keep watch.
016.035 -- Are you sure?
016.036 -- I saw the soldier's shako and the end of his rifle, and I only withdrew so quickly for fear that he would see me.
016.037 --Well?" said Dantes.
016.038 --You can see that it is impossible to escape through your dungeon.
016.039 --Then? continued the young man with a questioning accent.
016.040 --Then, said the old prisoner, God's will be done!"
016.041 And a tinge of deep resignation spread over the old man's features.
016.042 Dantes looked at this man who was thus and so philosophically renouncing a hope nourished for so long, with astonishment mixed with admiration.
016.043 "Now, will you tell me who you are?" asked Dantes.
016.044 --Oh, my God, yes, if that can still interest you, now that I can no longer be good for anything.
016.045 --You can be good for consoling me and supporting me, for you seem to me strong among the strong."
016.046 The abbot smiled sadly.
016.047 "I am Abbé Faria," he said, "a prisoner since 1811, as you know, in the château d'If; but I had been for three years confined in the fortress of Fenestrelle. In 1811, I was transferred from Piedmont to France. It was then that I learned that destiny, which at that time seemed to be submissive to him, had given a son to Napoleon, and that this son in the cradle had been named king of Rome. I was far from suspecting then what you told me just now: that, four years later, the colossus would be overthrown. Who then reigns in France? Is it Napoleon II?
016.048 -- No, it is Louis XVIII.
016.049 --Louis XVIII, the brother of Louis XVI, the decrees of heaven are strange and mysterious. What, then, was the intention of Providence in lowering the man it had raised and in raising the one it had lowered?"
016.050 Dantes followed with his eyes this man who forgot his own destiny for a moment to be thus concerned with the destinies of the world.
016.051 "Yes, yes," he continued, "it is as in England: after Charles I, Cromwell, after Cromwell, Charles II, and perhaps after James II, some son-in-law, some relative, some Prince of Orange; a stathouder who will make himself king; and then new concessions to the people, then a constitution, then freedom! You will see that, young man," he said, turning back to Dantes, and looking at him with brilliant and deep eyes, such as the prophets must have had. You are still of an age to see it; you will see it.
016.052 --Yes, if I get out of here.
016.053 --Ah, that's right, said Father Faria. There are moments when I forget that, and when, because my eyes pierce the walls that enclose me, I believe myself to be at liberty.
016.054 --But why are you locked up?
016.055 --Me? because I dreamed in 1807 the project that Napoleon wanted to realize in 1811; because, like Machiavelli, in the midst of all those principicles that made Italy a nest of small, tyrannical and weak kingdoms, I wanted a great and only empire, compact and strong: because I believed to find my Caesar Borgia in a crowned fool who pretended to understand me in order to better betray me. This was the project of Alexander VI and Clement VII; it will always fail, since they undertook it in vain and Napoleon could not complete it; decidedly Italy is cursed!"
016.056 And the old man bowed his head.
016.057 Dantes did not understand how a man could risk his life for such interests; it is true that if he knew Napoleon for having seen him and having spoken to him, he was completely ignorant, on the other hand, of what Clement VII and Alexander VI were.
016.058 "Aren't you," said Dantes, beginning to share the opinion of his jailer, which was the general opinion in the Château d'If, "the priest who is believed to be... ill?
016.059 -- Who is thought to be mad, you mean, don't you?
016.060 -- I didn't dare, said Dantes, smiling.
016.061 --Yes, yes," continued Faria with a bitter laugh; "yes, it is I who pass for mad; it is I who have so long entertained the guests of this prison, and who would cheer the little children, if there were children in the sojourn of hopeless pain."
016.062 Dantes remained motionless and mute for a moment.
016.063 "So you give up running away?" he said to her.
016.064 --I see escape impossible; it is rebelling against God to attempt what God does not want to be accomplished.
016.065 -- Why should you be discouraged? It would be asking too much of Providence to want to succeed at the first attempt. Can't you do again in another direction what you did in this one?
016.066 - But do you know what I did, to speak thus of starting over? Do you know that it took me four years to make the tools I have? Do you know that for two years I have been scraping and digging a hard earth like granite? Do you know that I have had to remove stones that I would not have thought possible in the past, that entire days have been spent in this titanic work and that sometimes, in the evening, I was happy when I had removed a square inch of this old cement, which had become as hard as the stone itself? Do you know, do you know that in order to accommodate all this earth and all these stones that I buried, I had to pierce the vault of a staircase, in the drum of which all this rubble was in turn buried, so that today the drum is full, and I would not know where to put a handful of dust? Do you know, finally, that I thought I had reached the goal of all my work, that I felt I had the strength to accomplish this task, and that God not only moved this goal back, but also transported it to who knows where? Ah, I tell you, I tell you again, I will do nothing from now on to try to regain my freedom, since God's will is that it be lost forever."
016.067 Edmond bowed his head so as not to admit to the man that the joy of having a companion prevented him from sympathizing, as he should have, with the pain the prisoner felt at not being able to save himself.
016.068 Abbot Faria let himself lie on Edmund's bed, and Edmund remained standing.
016.069 The young man had never thought of running away. There are those things that seem so impossible that one does not even think of attempting them, and one avoids them by instinct. To dig fifty feet under the ground, to devote to this operation a work of three years to arrive, if one succeeds, at a precipice giving steeply on the sea; to precipitate oneself of fifty, sixty, perhaps of hundred feet, to crush oneself, while falling, the head on some rock, if the bullet of the sentinels did not already kill you before; To be obliged, if one escaped all these dangers, to swim a league, was too much for one not to resign himself, and we have seen that Dantes had almost pushed this resignation to the point of death.
016.070 But now that the young man had seen an old man clinging to life with such energy and giving him the example of desperate resolutions, he began to reflect and to measure his courage. Another had attempted what he had not even thought of doing; another, less young, less strong, less skilful than himself, had procured, by dint of skill and patience, all the instruments he needed for this incredible operation, which only a wrong measure could have caused to fail: another had done all this, so nothing was impossible to Dantes: Faria had drilled fifty feet, he would drill a hundred, Faria, at fifty years old, had taken three years to do his work; he was only half Faria's age, he would take six; Faria, abbot, scholar, man of the Church, had not feared to risk the crossing from the castle of If to the island of Daume, Ratonneau or Lemaire; he, Edmond the sailor, he, Dantes the bold diver, who had been so often to seek a branch of coral at the bottom of the sea, would he thus hesitate to make a league while swimming? What did it take to swim a league? an hour? Well, hadn't he stayed in the sea for hours without coming ashore! No, no, Dantes only needed to be encouraged by an example. Everything that another had done or could have done, Dantes would do.
016.071 The young man thought for a moment.
016.072 "I have found what you were looking for," he says to the old man.
016.073 Faria shuddered.
016.074 "You?" he said, raising his head with an air that indicated that if Dantes was telling the truth, his companion's despondency would not be long-lasting.
016.075 --The corridor that you cut to come from your house here runs in the same direction as the outer gallery, doesn't it?
016.076 --Yes.
016.077 --It must be only about fifteen paces away from it?
016.078 --At most.
016.079 --Well, toward the middle of the corridor we make a path forming the branch of a cross. This time you can measure better. We emerge on the outer gallery. We kill the sentry and we escape. For this plan to succeed, all you need is courage, which you have, and strength, which I have. I am not talking about patience, you have proven yourself and I will prove mine.
016.080 - One moment, replied the abbot; you have not known, my dear companion, what kind of courage I have, and what use I intend to make of my strength. As for patience, I believe I have been patient enough in starting again each morning the task of the night, and each night the task of the day. But then listen to me well, young man, it is that it seemed to me that I was serving God, by delivering one of his creatures who, being innocent, could not be condemned.
016.081 -- Well," asked Dantes, "isn't the matter at the same point, and have you recognized your guilt since you met me?
016.082 -- No, but I don't want to be. Up to now I thought I was dealing only with things, but now you propose to deal with men. I may have pierced a wall and destroyed a staircase, but I will not pierce a chest and destroy an existence."
016.083 Dantes made a slight movement of surprise.
016.084 "How," he said, "being able to be free, would you be held back by a similar scruple?
016.085 --But you yourself," said Faria, "why did you not knock your jailer out one evening with the leg of your table, put on his clothes and try to escape?
016.086 --The idea did not occur to me, said Dantes.
016.087 -It is that you have such an instinctive horror for such a crime, such a horror that you have not even thought of it," continued the old man; "for in simple and permissible things our natural appetites warn us that we do not deviate from the line of our right. The tiger, who sheds blood by nature, for which it is the state, the destination, needs only one thing, that his sense of smell warns him that he has a prey within his reach. Immediately, it leaps towards this prey, falls on it and tears it. This is his instinct, and he obeys it. But man, on the contrary, repels blood; it is not the social laws that repel murder, it is the natural laws."
016.088 Dantes remained confounded: this was, indeed, the explanation of what had passed unbeknownst to him in his mind, or rather in his soul, for there are thoughts that come from the head, and others that come from the heart.
016.089 "And then," continued Faria, "for the past twelve years that I have been in prison, I have gone over in my mind all the famous escapes. I have seen escapes succeed only rarely. The happy escapes, the escapes crowned with a full success, are the escapes meditated with care and slowly prepared; it is thus that the duke of Beaufort escaped from the castle of Vincennes; the abbot Dubuquoi from the Fort-l'Évêque, and Latude from the Bastille. There are still those which chance can offer: those are the best; let us wait for an occasion, believe me, and if this occasion presents itself, let us benefit from it.
016.090 -- "You could wait, you," said Dantes, sighing; "this long work kept you busy all the time, and when you did not have your work to distract you, you had your hopes to console you.
016.091 -- Then," said the abbot, "that was all I was occupied with.
016.092 -- What were you doing then?
016.093 -- Writing or studying.
016.094 -- So you were given paper, pens, ink?
016.095 -- No," said the abbot, "but I make do.
016.096 -- You make yourself paper, pens and ink?" cried Dantes.
016.097 --Yes." Dantes looked at this man with admiration; only he still could hardly believe what he was saying. Faria noticed this slight doubt.
016.098 "When you come to my house," he said to him, "I will show you a whole work, the result of the thoughts, researches, and reflections of my whole life, which I had meditated in the shadow of the Colosseum in Rome, at the foot of St. Mark's column in Venice, on the banks of the Arno in Florence, and which I scarcely suspected that one day my gaolers would give me the leisure to execute within the four walls of the Château d'If. It is a _Treaty on the possibility of a general monarchy in Italy_. It will make a large volume in-quarto.
016.099 --And you wrote it?
016.100 --On two folders. I have invented a preparation that makes the linen smooth and even as parchment.
016.101 -- So you are a chemist.
016.102 --A little. I knew Lavoisier and I am related to Cabanis.
016.103 --But for a work like this, you had to do some historical research. So you had books?
016.104 -- In Rome, I had about five thousand volumes in my library. By dint of reading and rereading them, I discovered that with one hundred and fifty well-chosen works one has, if not the complete summary of human knowledge, at least all that it is useful for a man to know. I devoted three years of my life to reading and re-reading these one hundred and fifty volumes, so that I knew them more or less by heart when I was arrested. In my prison, with a slight effort of memory, I remembered them completely. Thus I could recite to you Thucydides, Xenophon, Plutarch, Titus Livius, Tacitus, Strada, Jornanes, Dante, Montaigne, Shakespeare, Spinosa, Machiavelli and Bossuet. I will only mention the most important ones.
016.105 --But you know several languages?
016.106 -- I speak five living languages, German, French, Italian, English and Spanish; with the help of ancient Greek I understand modern Greek; I only speak it poorly, but I am studying it now.
016.107 --You are studying it? said Dantes.
016.108 --Yes, I have made myself a vocabulary of the words I know, I have arranged them, combined them, turned them around and around, so that they may suffice to express my thoughts. I know about a thousand words, that's all I need, although there are a hundred thousand, I think, in the dictionaries. Only I will not be eloquent, but I will make myself understood wonderfully, and that is enough for me."
016.109 Increasingly amazed, Edmund began to find the faculties of this strange man almost supernatural; he wanted to find him wanting on some point, he continued:
016.110 "But if you were not given feathers," he said, "with what could you have written this voluminous treatise?
016.111 -- I made some excellent ones for myself, which would be preferable to ordinary feathers if the material were known, with the cartilage from the heads of those enormous whiting that are sometimes served to us during the lean days. So I always look forward to Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays with great pleasure, for they give me the hope of increasing my supply of feathers, and my historical work is, I confess, my sweetest occupation. By descending into the past, I forget the present; by walking free and independent in history, I no longer remember that I am a prisoner.
016.112 --But ink? said Dantes, with what did you make ink?
016.113 -- There was once a chimney in my dungeon, said Faria; this chimney was blocked up some time before my arrival, no doubt, but for many years they had made a fire in it: the whole interior is therefore covered with soot. I dissolve this soot in a portion of the wine that is given to me every Sunday; it provides me with excellent ink. For particular notes, which need to attract the eyes, I prick my fingers and write with my blood.
016.114 -- And when can I see all this?
016.115 -- Whenever you like, replied Faria.
016.116 --Oh! at once! cried the young man.
016.117 -- "Follow me," said the abbot.
016.118 And he went into the underground corridor where he disappeared. Dantes followed him.
017.000 The abbot's room.
017.001 After having passed through the underground passageway, bending down, but nevertheless with relative ease, Dantes reached the opposite end of the corridor which led to the abbot's room. Here the passage narrowed and offered barely enough space for a man to crawl through. The abbot's room was paved; it was by lifting one of these slabs placed in the darkest corner that he had begun the laborious operation whose end Dantes had seen.
017.002 As soon as he entered and stood up, the young man examined this room with great attention. At first glance, there was nothing special about it.
017.003 "Well," said the abbot, "it's only a quarter past noon, and we still have a few hours ahead of us."
017.004 Dantes looked around, searching for what clock the abbot had been able to read the time so accurately.
017.005 "Look at this ray of daylight coming through my window," said the abbot, "and look on the wall at the lines I have drawn. Thanks to these lines, which are combined with the double movement of the earth and the ellipse it describes around the sun, I know the time more exactly than if I had a watch, for a watch gets out of order, while the sun and the earth never get out of order."
017.006 Dantes had understood nothing of this explanation; he had always believed, when he saw the sun rise behind the mountains and set in the Mediterranean, that it was he who walked and not the earth. This double movement of the globe which he inhabited, and yet of which he was not aware, seemed almost impossible to him; in each of the words of his interlocutor, he saw mysteries of science as admirable to dig as those gold and diamond mines which he had visited in a journey which he had made almost as a child to Guzarate and Golconde.
017.007 "Let's see," he said to the abbot, "I am anxious to examine your treasures."
017.008 The abbot went to the fireplace, moved with the chisel he always held in his hand the stone that once formed the hearth and which hid a rather deep cavity; it was in this cavity that all the objects he had told Dantes about were contained.
017.009 "What do you want to see first?" he asked him.
017.010 -Show me your great work on royalty in Italy."
017.011 Faria drew from the precious cupboard three or four rolls of linen turned in on themselves, like sheets of papyrus: they were strips of cloth, about four inches wide and eighteen long. These strips, numbered, were covered with writing that Dantes could read, for they were written in the abbot's mother tongue, that is, in Italian, an idiom that, as a Provençal, Dantes understood perfectly.
017.012 "See," he said to her, "everything is there; it is about eight days since I wrote the word End at the bottom of the sixty-eighth strip. Two of my shirts and all that I had of handkerchiefs passed there; if ever I become free again and that it is found in all Italy a printer who dares to print me, my reputation is made.
017.013 --Yes, replied Dantes, I see. And now, please show me the pens with which this work was written.
017.014 -- See," said Faria. And he showed the young man a small stick six inches long, as big as the handle of a brush, at the end of which was tied by a thread one of those cartilages, still stained by ink, of which the abbot had spoken to Dantes; it was elongated in a beak and split like an ordinary feather. Dantes examined it, looking with his eyes for the instrument with which it could have been cut in such a correct manner.
017.015 "Ah, yes," said Faria, "the penknife, isn't it? It is my masterpiece; I made it, as well as the knife here, with an old iron candlestick."
017.016 The penknife cut like a razor. As for the knife, it had the advantage that it could be used both as a knife and a dagger. Dantes examined these various objects with the same attention that, in the curiosity stores of Marseilles, he had sometimes examined these instruments made by savages and brought back from the South Seas by the captains of the long course.
017.017 "As for the ink," said Faria, "you know how I proceed; I make it as I need it.
017.018 -- Now, I am surprised at one thing, said Dantes, it is that the days were enough for you for all this work.
017.019 --I had the nights, replied Faria.
017.020 --Nights! Are you then of the nature of cats and do you see clearly at night?
017.021 --No; but God gave man intelligence to help the poverty of his senses: I got myself some light.
017.022 --How is that?
017.023 - I separate the fat from the meat that is brought to me, I melt it and I get a kind of compact oil. Here is my candle."
017.024 And the abbot showed Dantes a sort of lantern, like those used in public illuminations.
017.025 "But fire?
017.026 --Here are two pebbles and some burnt linen.
017.027 --But matches?
017.028 --I pretended to have a skin disease, and asked for some sulfur, which was granted."
017.029 Dantes put down the objects he held on the table and bowed his head, crushed under the perseverance and strength of this spirit.
017.030 "That is not all," continued Faria; "for one must not put all one's treasures in one hiding place; let us close this one."
017.031 They put the slab in its place; the abbot sowed a little dust on it, ran his foot over it to remove any trace of a solution of continuity, went over to his bed and moved it.
017.032 Behind the bedside, hidden by a stone which closed it with almost perfect hermeticity, was a hole, and in this hole a rope ladder twenty-five to thirty feet long.
017.033 Dantes examined it: it was solid as a rock.
017.034 "Who supplied you with the rope for this wonderful work?" asked Dantes.
017.035 -First, some shirts I had, then the sheets from my bed, which I tapered during my three years of captivity at Fenestrelle. When I was transported to the château d'If, I found a way to take this thinning with me; here I continued the work.
017.036 --But didn't you notice that the sheets of your bed had no hem?
017.037 -- I sewed them up.
017.038 --With what?
017.039 --With this needle."
017.040 And the abbot, opening a flap of his clothing, showed Dantes a long, sharp, and still threaded ridge, which he was carrying.
017.041 "Yes," continued Faria, "I had at first thought of unsealing those bars and escaping through that window, which is a little wider than yours, as you see, and which I would have widened still further at the time of my escape; but I found that this window looked out on an inner court, and I gave up my project as being too lucky. However, I kept the ladder for an unforeseen circumstance, for one of those escapes of which I spoke to you, and which chance provides."
017.042 Dantes while seeming to examine the ladder, was this time thinking of something else; an idea had crossed his mind. It was that this man, so intelligent, so ingenious, so profound, would perhaps see clearly in the darkness of his own misfortune, where he himself had never been able to distinguish anything.
017.043 "What are you thinking of?" asked the abbot, smiling, and taking Dantes' absorption for admiration carried to the highest degree.
017.044 --I am thinking of one thing at first, and that is the enormous amount of intelligence you had to expend to arrive at the goal you have reached; what would you have done freely?
017.045 -Nothing, perhaps: this overflow of my brain would have evaporated in trivia. It takes misfortune to dig certain mysterious mines hidden in human intelligence; it takes pressure to make the powder burst. Captivity brought together on a single point all my faculties floating here and there; they collided in a narrow space; and, as you know, from the clash of clouds results electricity, from electricity lightning, from lightning light.
017.046 --No, I don't know anything, said Dantes, dejected by his ignorance; some of the words you pronounce are empty words to me; you are very happy to be so learned, you!"
017.047 The abbot smiled.
017.048 "You were thinking of two things, you said just now?
017.049 --Yes.
017.050 --And you only told me the first; what is the second?
017.051 --The second is that you have told me your life story, and you don't know mine.
017.052 -- Your life, young man, is very short to contain events of any importance.
017.053 --It contains an immense misfortune, said Dantes; a misfortune that I did not deserve; and I would like, in order not to blaspheme God any more as I have done sometimes, to be able to blame the men of my misfortune.
017.054 -So you claim to be innocent of the crime you are accused of?
017.055 --Completely innocent, on the heads of the only two people who are dear to me, on the heads of my father and Mercedes.
017.056 --Let's see," said the abbot, closing his hiding place and pushing his bed back into its place, "tell me your story."
017.057 Dantès then told what he called his story, which was limited to a voyage to India and two or three voyages to the Levant; finally, he came to his last crossing, to the death of Captain Leclère, to the packet delivered by him for the grand marshal, to the interview with the grand marshal, to the letter delivered by him and addressed to a M. Noirtier; finally to his arrival in Marseilles, to his meeting with his father, to his love affair with Mercédès, to the meal of his engagement, to his arrest, to his interrogation, to his provisional prison in the palace of justice, and finally to his definitive prison in the château d'If. Once there, Dantes knew nothing more, not even how long he had been a prisoner there.
017.058 When the story was finished, the abbot reflected deeply.
017.059 "There is," he said after a moment, "an axiom of law of great depth, and which comes back to what I told you earlier, that unless evil thought is born with a distorted organization, human nature is repugnant to crime. However, civilization has given us needs, vices, artificial appetites which sometimes have the influence of making us stifle our good instincts and which lead us to evil. Hence this maxim: If you want to find the culprit, first look for the one to whom the crime committed can be useful! To whom could your disappearance be useful?
017.060 -- To no one, my God! I was so little.
017.061 -- Don't answer like that, because the answer lacks both logic and philosophy; everything is relative, my dear friend, from the king who hinders his future successor, to the employee who hinders the supernumerary: if the king dies, the successor inherits a crown; if the employee dies, the supernumerary inherits twelve hundred pounds of salary. These twelve hundred pounds of salary are his civil list; they are as necessary for him to live as the twelve millions of a king. Each individual, from the lowest to the highest degree of the social scale, groups around him a whole little world of interests, having its vortices and its hooked atoms, like Descartes' worlds. Only, these worlds are always widening as they rise. It is an inverted spiral that stands on its tip by a game of balance. Let's get back to your world. Were you going to be appointed captain of the _Pharaoh_?
017.062 -- Yes.
017.063 --You were going to marry a beautiful girl?
017.064 --Yes.
017.065 --Did anyone have an interest in your not becoming captain of the _Pharaoh_? Did anyone have an interest in your not marrying Mercedes? Answer the first question first; order is the key to all problems. Did anyone have an interest in your not becoming captain of the _Pharaoh_?
017.066 -- No; I was much loved on board. If the sailors could have elected a leader, I am sure they would have elected me. Only one man had some reason to resent me: I had had a quarrel with him some time before, and I had proposed a duel, which he had refused.
017.067 -Come on, then? This man, what was his name?
017.068 --Danglars.
017.069 -- What was he on board?
017.070 --Accountant.
017.071 --If you had become captain, would you have kept him in his position?
017.072 -- No, if the matter had depended on me, because I thought I had noticed some infidelities in his accounts.
017.073 --Good. Now, was anyone present at your last meeting with Captain Leclère?
017.074 -- No, we were alone.
017.075 --Was anyone able to hear your conversation?
017.076 -- Yes, because the door was open; and even... wait... yes, yes Danglars passed by just as Captain Leclère was handing me the package intended for the Grand Marshal.
017.077 - "Well," said the abbot, "we are on the way. Did you bring anyone with you when you went ashore at Elba?
017.078 -- No one.
017.079 -- Were you given a letter?
017.080 -- Yes, the Grand Marshal.
017.081 -- What did you do with this letter?
017.082 -- I put it in my wallet.
017.083 -- So you had your wallet with you? How could a wallet containing an official letter fit in a sailor's pocket?
017.084 -- You are right, my wallet was on board.
017.085 -So it was only on board that you locked the letter in the wallet?
017.086 --Yes.
017.087 --From Puerto Ferrajo to the ship, what did you do with the letter?
017.088 -- I held it in my hand.
017.089 --When you went up on the _Pharaon_, everyone could see that you were holding a letter?
017.090 --Yes.
017.091 --Danglars like the others?
017.092 --Danglars like the others.
017.093 --Now listen carefully; gather all your memories: do you remember in what terms the denunciation was written?
017.094 --Oh, yes, I read it three times, and every word of it has remained in my memory.
017.095 --Repeat it for me."
017.096 Dantes recollected himself for a moment.
017.097 "Here it is," he said, "verbatim:
017.098 "_M. le procureur du roi est prévenu par un ami du trône et de la religion que le nommé Edmond Dantès, second in command of the ship the_ Pharaon, _arrived this morning from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, was charged by Murat with a packet for the usurper, and by the usurper with a letter for the Bonapartist committee in Paris_.
017.099 "_We shall have the proof of his crime by arresting him, for this letter will be found on him, or at his father's house, or in his cabin on board the_ Pharaon."
017.100 The abbot shrugged his shoulders.
017.101 "It's as clear as day," he said, "you must have had a very naive and good heart not to have guessed the thing at first.
017.102 --You think so?" cried Dantes. Ah! that would be very infamous!
017.103 --What was Danglars' ordinary handwriting?
017.104 --A beautiful cursive.
017.105 --What was the handwriting of the anonymous letter?
017.106 --A reversed handwriting."
017.107 The abbot smiled.
017.108 "Forged, isn't it?
017.109 --Bold to be forged.
017.110 --Hold on," he said.
017.111 He took his pen, or rather what he called it, dipped it in ink and wrote with his left hand, on a cloth prepared for the purpose, the first two or three lines of the denunciation.
017.112 Dantes stepped back and looked almost in terror at the abbot.
017.113 "Oh, it's astonishing," he cried, "how similar this handwriting is to this one.
017.114 -It is that the denunciation had been written with the left hand. I observed one thing," continued the abbot.
017.115 -What was it?
017.116 -It is that all the writings made with the right hand are varied, and that all the writings made with the left hand are similar.
017.117 -- So you have seen everything, observed everything?
017.118 --Continue.
017.119 -- Oh, yes, yes.
017.120 --Let's move on to the second question.
017.121 --I am listening.
017.122 -- Did anyone have an interest in your not marrying Mercedes?
017.123 -- Yes! A young man who loved her.
017.124 --His name?
017.125 --Fernand.
017.126 --Is that a Spanish name?
017.127 --He was Catalan.
017.128 --Do you think this one was able to write the letter?
017.129 --No! This one would have stabbed me. That is all.
017.130 -- Yes, that is Spanish nature: murder, yes, but cowardice, no.
017.131 -- Besides," continued Dantes, "he did not know all the details recorded in the denunciation.
017.132 --You did not give them to anyone? Not even to your mistress?
017.133 --Not even to my fiancée.
017.134 --It's Danglars.
017.135 --Oh! now I'm sure of it.
017.136 --Wait.... Did Danglars know Fernand?
017.137 --No...yes.... I remember....
017.138 --What?
017.139 --On my wedding vigil I saw them sitting together under Father Pamphile's arbour. Danglars was friendly and mocking, Fernand was pale and troubled.
017.140 --Were they alone?
017.141 -- No, they had with them a third companion, well known to me, who no doubt had introduced them to each other, a tailor named Caderousse; but this one was already drunk. Wait... wait.... How did I not remember that? Near the table where they were drinking were an inkwell, paper, and quills. (Dantes raised his hand to his forehead). Oh! the vile! the vile!
017.142 --Do you want to know anything else?" said the abbot, laughing.
017.143 --Yes, yes, since you go into everything in depth, since you see everything clearly, I want to know why I have only been questioned once, why I have not been given judges, and how I am condemned without stopping.
017.144 --Oh, this, says the abbot, is a little more serious; justice has dark and mysterious aspects that are difficult to penetrate. What we have done so far for your two friends was child's play; it will be necessary, on this subject, to give me the most precise indications.
017.145 -- Let's see, ask me, because in truth you see more clearly in my life than I do.
017.146 -- Who questioned you? Was it the public prosecutor, the deputy, the examining magistrate?
017.147 -- It was the substitute.
017.148 --Young or old?
017.149 --Young: twenty-seven or twenty-eight.
017.150 --Well, not yet corrupt, but already ambitious, said the abbot. What were his manners with you?
017.151 --Mild rather than severe.
017.152 --Have you told him everything?
017.153 --Everything.
017.154 --And did his manner change in the course of the interrogation?
017.155 -For a moment they were altered, when he read the letter that compromised me; he seemed overwhelmed by my misfortune.
017.156 --With your misfortune?
017.157 -- Yes.
017.158 --And you are quite sure that it was your misfortune that he pitied?
017.159 -- He gave me great proof of his sympathy, at least.
017.160 --What was it?
017.161 -- He burned the only piece that could compromise me.
017.162 --What? The denunciation?
017.163 -- No, the letter.
017.164 --Are you sure?
017.165 --That happened in front of me.
017.166 --That's another thing; this man could be a deeper villain than you think.
017.167 --You make me shudder, on my honor! said Dantes, is the world populated by tigers and crocodiles?
017.168 -- Yes; only the tigers and the two-footed crocodiles are more dangerous than the others.
017.169 --Continue, continue.
017.170 --Willingly; he burned the letter, you say?
017.171 --Yes, saying to me, "You see, there is only this evidence against you, and I am destroying it."
017.172 --This behavior is too sublime to be natural.
017.173 --You think so?
017.174 -- I am sure of it. To whom was this letter addressed?
017.175 -- To M. Noirtier, rue Coq-Héron, No. 13, in Paris.
017.176 --Can you assume that your substitute had any interest in the disappearance of this letter?
017.177 --Perhaps; for he made me promise two or three times, in my interest, he said, not to speak to anyone about this letter, and he made me swear not to mention the name that was written on the address.
017.178 --Noirtier? repeated the abbot.... Noirtier? I knew a Noirtier at the court of the former Queen of Etruria, a Noirtier who had been a Girondin during the Revolution. What was the name of your substitute?
017.179 --De Villefort."
017.180 The abbot burst out laughing.
017.181 Dantes looked at him in amazement.
017.182 "What's the matter?" he said.
017.183 --Do you see this ray of daylight?" asked the abbot.
017.184 --Yes.
017.185 --Well, everything is clearer to me now than this transparent, luminous ray. Poor child, poor young man! And that magistrate was good to you.
017.186 --Yes.
017.187 --That worthy substitute burned, destroyed the letter?
017.188 --Yes.
017.189 --That honest purveyor of the executioner made you swear never to utter the name of Noirtier?
017.190 --Yes.
017.191 --This Noirtier, poor blind man that you are, do you know what this Noirtier was? "This Noirtier was his father!"
017.192 Lightning, falling at the feet of Dantes and digging for him an abyss at the bottom of which opened hell, would have produced a less rapid, less electric, less crushing effect on him than these unexpected words; he rose, grasping his head with both hands as if to prevent it from bursting.
017.193 "His father! His father!" he cried.
017.194 --Yes, his father, who is called Noirtier de Villefort," continued the abbot.
017.195 Then a dazzling light flashed through the prisoner's brain, everything that had remained obscure to him was at once illuminated with a bright light. The dithering of Villefort during the interrogation, the destroyed letter, the demanded oath, the almost imploring voice of the magistrate, who, instead of threatening, seemed to be imploring, all came back to his memory; he gave a cry, staggered for a moment like a drunken man; then, rushing through the opening which led from the abbe's cell to his own, he said: "Oh!
017.196 "Oh!" he said, "I must be alone to think of all this."
017.197 And, on reaching his dungeon, he fell on his bed, where the key-bearer found him in the evening, seated, his eyes fixed, his features contracted, but motionless and mute as a statue.
017.198 During those hours of meditation, which had passed like seconds, he had made a terrible resolution and a formidable oath.
017.199 A voice drew Dantes out of this reverie; it was that of Abbot Faria, who, having received a visit from his jailer, had come to invite Dantes to dine with him. His quality of recognized madman, and especially of entertaining madman, was worth to the old prisoner some privileges, like that to have bread a little whiter and a small bottle of wine on Sunday. Now it was Sunday, and the abbot had come to invite his young companion to share his bread and wine.
017.200 Dantes followed him: all the lines of his face had recovered and resumed their accustomed place, but with a stiffness and firmness, if one may say so, which showed a resolution taken. The abbot stared at him.
017.201 "I am sorry to have helped you in your search and to have told you what I told you," he said.
017.202 -Why is that?" asked Dantes.
017.203 --Because I have infiltrated your heart with a feeling that was not there: revenge."
017.204 Dantes smiled.
017.205 "Let's talk about something else," he said.
017.206 The abbot looked at him again for a moment and nodded sadly; then, as Dantes had asked, he spoke of something else.
017.207 The old prisoner was one of those men whose conversation, like that of people who have suffered a great deal, contains many lessons and is of sustained interest; but it was not selfish, and this unhappy man never spoke of his misfortunes.
017.208 Dantes listened to each of his words with admiration: some of them corresponded to ideas he already had and to knowledge which was within the scope of his state as a sailor, others touched on unknown things, and, like those aurora borealis which illuminate navigators in the southern latitudes, showed the young man new landscapes and horizons, illuminated with fantastic gleams. Dantes understood the happiness that there would be for an intelligent organization to follow this spirit raised on the moral, philosophical or social heights on which it was accustomed to play.
017.209 "You should teach me a little of what you know," said Dantes, "if only to keep from boring you with me. It seems to me now that you must prefer solitude to an uneducated and unreachable companion like myself. If you will consent to what I ask of you, I promise not to speak to you again about running away."
017.210 The abbot smiled.
017.211 "Alas, my child," he said, "human science is quite limited, and when I have taught you mathematics, physics, history, and the three or four living languages I speak, you will know what I know: now, all this science I shall be two years short of pouring it from my mind into yours.
017.212 -Two years!" said Dantes, "do you think I could learn all these things in two years?
017.213 --In their application, no; in their principles, yes: to learn is not to know; there are those who know and those who know: it is memory that makes the one, it is philosophy that makes the other.
017.214 - But can we not learn philosophy?
017.215 --Philosophy cannot be learned; philosophy is the union of the acquired sciences with the genius that applies them: philosophy is the bright cloud on which Christ set foot to ascend to heaven.
017.216 -- Let us see, says Dantes, what do you teach me first? I am in a hurry to start, I am thirsty for science.
017.217 --All!" said the abbot.
017.218 Indeed, that evening the two prisoners decided on a plan of education which began to be carried out the next day. Dantes had a prodigious memory, an extreme facility of conception: the mathematical disposition of his mind made him capable of understanding everything by calculation, while the poetry of the sailor corrected all that could have been too material in a demonstration reduced to the dryness of figures or the rectitude of lines; he already knew, moreover, Italian and a little Roman, which he had learned in his travels in the East. With these two languages, he soon understood the mechanism of all the others, and, after six months, he began to speak Spanish, English and German. As he had told Father Faria, either the distraction of study took the place of freedom, or he was, as we have already seen, rigidly observant of his speech, he no longer spoke of running away, and the days passed for him quickly and instructively. After a year he was a different man.
017.219 As for Abbot Faria, Dantes noticed that, in spite of the distraction which his presence had brought to his captivity, he grew darker every day. An incessant and eternal thought seemed to besiege his mind; he fell into deep reveries, sighed involuntarily, rose suddenly, crossed his arms, and walked gloomily around his prison.
017.220 One day he suddenly stopped in the middle of one of those hundred times repeated circles that he described around his room, and cried out:
017.221 "Ah! if there were no sentry!
017.222 --There will be no sentry except as you wish," said Dantes, who had followed his thought through the box of his brain as through a crystal.
017.223 --Ah! I told you," said the abbot, "I am repulsed by murder.
017.224 --And yet this murder, if it is committed, will be done out of the instinct of self-preservation, out of a feeling of self-defense.
017.225 -- Anyway, I can't.
017.226 -- You are thinking about it, though?
017.227 --Constantly, constantly, murmured the abbot.
017.228 --And you have found a way, haven't you?
017.229 -- Yes, if it happened that a blind and deaf sentry could be placed on the gallery.
017.230 -- "She will be blind, she will be deaf," replied the young man with an accent of resolution that frightened the abbot.
017.231 --No, no!" he cried; "impossible.
017.232 Dantes wanted to detain him on this subject, but the abbot shook his head and refused to answer further.
017.233 Three months passed.
017.234 "Are you strong?" the abbot asked Dantes one day.
017.235 Dantes, without answering, took the chisel, twisted it like a horseshoe and straightened it.
017.236 "Would you commit yourself to killing the sentry only in the last extremity?
017.237 --Yes, on my honor.
017.238 --Then, said the abbot, we can carry out our plan.
017.239 -- And how long will it take us to carry it out?
017.240 -- One year, at least.
017.241 --But we could get to work?
017.242 --At once.
017.243 -- See, we've lost a year," cried Dantes.
017.244 --Do you think we have lost it?
017.245 --Oh, pardon, pardon," cried Edmund, blushing.
017.246 --Hush!" said the abbot, "a man is only ever a man; and you are still one of the best I have known. Here is my plan."
017.247 The abbe then showed Dantes a drawing he had made: it was the plan of his room, of Dantes' room, and of the corridor which joined one to the other. In the middle of this gallery, he established a hose similar to that which one practises in the mines. This tunnel led the two prisoners under the gallery where the sentry was walking; once there, they made a large excavation, unsealed one of the slabs which formed the floor of the gallery; the slab, at a given moment, sank under the weight of the soldier, who disappeared engulfed in the excavation; Dantes rushed upon him at the moment when, dazed by his fall, he could not defend himself, bound him, gagged him, and both then, passing through one of the windows of this gallery, descended along the outer wall by means of the rope ladder and saved themselves.
017.248 Dantes clapped his hands and his eyes sparkled with joy; this plan was so simple that it was bound to succeed.
017.249 That same day the miners set to work with all the more ardor, since this work followed a long rest, and in all probability only continued the intimate and secret thoughts of each of them.
017.250 Nothing interrupted them but the hour at which each of them was forced to return home to receive the visit of the jailer. They had, moreover, become accustomed to distinguishing, by the imperceptible sound of footsteps, the moment when this man came down, and neither of them was ever caught unawares. The earth which they extracted from the new gallery, and which would have ended up filling the old corridor, was thrown little by little, and with unheard-of precautions, through one or other of the two windows of Dantes' dungeon or Faria's dungeon: it was pulverized with care, and the night wind carried it away without leaving any trace.
017.251 More than a year passed in this work, carried out with a chisel, a knife, and a wooden lever for all instruments; during this year, and while working, Faria continued to instruct Dantes, speaking to him sometimes one language, sometimes another, teaching him the history of nations and of great men who from time to time leave behind them one of those luminous traces which we call glory. The abbot, a man of the world and of the great world, had, moreover, in his manners, a sort of melancholy majesty from which Dantes, thanks to the spirit of assimilation with which nature had endowed him, was able to extract that elegant politeness which he lacked and those aristocratic manners which one usually acquires only by the friction of the higher classes or the society of superior men.
017.252 At the end of fifteen months, the hole was completed; the excavation was made under the gallery; the sentry could be heard passing and re-passing, and the two workmen, who were forced to wait for a dark and moonless night to make their escape even more certain, had only one fear left: it was to see the too hasty ground collapse of itself under the feet of the soldier. This inconvenience was avoided by placing a sort of small beam, which they had found in the foundations as a support. Dantes was busy placing it, when he suddenly heard Abbé Faria, who had remained in the young man's room, where he was busy sharpening a peg intended to hold the rope ladder, calling him with an accent of distress. Dantes returned briskly, and saw the abbe standing in the middle of the room, pale, with sweat on his forehead and his hands clenched.
017.253 "Oh, my God!" cried Dantes, "what is it, and what have you got?
017.254 --Hurry, hurry!" said the abbot, "listen to me."
017.255 Dantes looked at Faria's livid face, his eyes ringed with a bluish circle, his white lips, his bristling hair; and in terror he dropped to the ground the chisel he held in his hand.
017.256 "But what is it?" cried Edmond.
017.257 --I am lost!" said the abbot. A terrible, perhaps fatal, illness is about to seize me; I can feel it coming on: I was already afflicted with it the year before my imprisonment. There is only one remedy for this illness, I will tell you: run quickly to my house, raise the foot of the bed; this foot is hollow, you will find there a small bottle half full of a red liquor, bring it; or rather, no, no, I could be surprised here; help me to return to my house while I still have some strength. Who knows what will happen while the attack lasts?
017.258 Dantes, without losing his head, although the misfortune that befell him was immense, went down the corridor, dragging his unfortunate companion after him, and leading him, with infinite difficulty, to the opposite end, found himself in the abbot's room, which he laid on his bed.
017.259 "Thank you," said the abbot, shivering with all his limbs as if he had come out of an icy water. Here comes the evil, I shall fall into catalepsy; perhaps I shall not make a movement, perhaps I shall not utter a complaint; but perhaps I shall foam, I shall stiffen, I shall cry out; try not to let my cries be heard, that is the important thing, for then perhaps I shall be changed to another room, and we shall be separated for ever. When you see me motionless, cold and dead, so to speak, only at that moment, hear you well, loosen my teeth with the knife, pour into my mouth eight or ten drops of this liquor, and perhaps I will return.
017.260 --Maybe? cried Dantes painfully.
017.261 -- "To me! To me!" cried the abbot, "I am... I am..."
017.262 The fit was so sudden and so violent that the unhappy prisoner could not even finish the word begun; a cloud passed over his forehead, swift and dark as the storms of the sea; the crisis dilated his eyes, twisted his mouth, puffed up his cheeks; he agitated, cried out, roared; but as he himself had recommended, Dantes stifled his cries under his blanket. This lasted two hours. Then, more inert than a mass, paler and colder than marble, more broken than a reed trodden under foot, he fell, stiffened again in a last convulsion, and became livid. Edmond waited until this apparent death had invaded the body and frozen to the heart; then he took the knife, inserted the blade between the teeth, loosened with infinite difficulty the clenched jaws, counted one after the other ten drops of the red liquor, and waited. An hour passed without the old man making the slightest movement. Dantes feared that he had waited too late, and looked at him with both hands buried in his hair. At last a slight coloring appeared on his cheeks; his eyes, which had always remained open and atonic, regained their gaze; a faint sigh escaped from his mouth; he made a movement.
017.263 "Saved! Saved!" cried Dantes.
017.264 The patient could not speak yet, but with visible anxiety he stretched out his hand toward the door. Dantes listened, and heard the jailer's footsteps: it was nearly seven o'clock, and Dantes had not had the leisure to measure the time.
017.265 The young man leaped to the opening, sank down, replaced the slab over his head, and went home.
017.266 A moment later, his door opened in turn, and the jailer, as usual, found the prisoner sitting on his bed.
017.267 As soon as his back was turned, and the sound of footsteps was lost in the corridor, Dantes, consumed with anxiety, took up the path he had just taken, without thinking of eating, and, lifting the slab with his head, entered the abbot's room.
017.268 The abbot had regained consciousness, but he was still lying inert and without strength on his bed.
017.269 "I did not expect to see you again," he said to Dantes.
017.270 --Why is that?" asked the young man; "Were you planning to die?
017.271 --No; but everything is ready for your escape, and I counted on you escaping."
017.272 The redness of indignation colored the cheeks of Dantes.
017.273 "Without you! he cried; did you really think me capable of this?
017.274 -- Now I see that I was mistaken," said the patient. Ah, I am very weak, very broken, very shattered.
017.275 --Courage, your strength will return," said Dantes, sitting down by Faria's bed and taking his hands. The abbot shook his head.
017.276 "The last time," he said, "the attack lasted half an hour, after which I was hungry and got up alone; today I can move neither my leg nor my right arm; my head is embarrassed, which proves an effusion in the brain. The third time, I will be completely paralyzed or I will die on the spot.
017.277 -- No, no, rest assured, you will not die; this third attack, if it takes you, will find you free. We will save you as we did this time, and better than this time, for we will have all the help we need.
017.278 -My friend," said the old man, "don't be fooled, the crisis that has just happened has condemned me to a perpetual prison: to escape, one must be able to walk.
017.279 -- Well, we will wait eight days, a month, two months, if necessary; in that interval your strength will return; everything is prepared for our escape, and we have the freedom to choose the hour and the moment. The day you feel strong enough to swim, well, on that day we will put our plan into execution.
017.280 --I will not swim any more, said Faria, this arm is paralyzed, not for a day, but for ever. Lift it yourself, and see what it weighs."
017.281 The young man lifted the arm, which fell back insensible. He heaved a sigh.
017.282 "You are convinced now, are you not, Edmund?" said Faria; "believe me, I know what I am saying: since the first attack I had of this ailment I have not ceased to think about it. I was waiting for it, because it is a family heritage; my father died at the third attack, my ancestor too. The doctor who composed this liquor for me, and who is none other than the famous Cabanis, predicted the same fate.
017.283 -- The doctor is mistaken, cried Dantes; as for your paralysis, it does not bother me, I will take you on my shoulders and swim while supporting you.
017.284 -- "Child," said the abbot, "you are a sailor, you are a swimmer, and therefore you must know that a man loaded with such a burden would not make fifty fathoms in the sea. Stop allowing yourself to be deceived by chimeras of which your excellent heart is not even the dupe: I shall therefore remain here until the hour of my deliverance sounds, which can now only be that of death. As for you, run away, go away! You are young, skilful and strong, do not worry about me, I give you your word.
017.285 -That's good, said Dantes. Well, then, I too will stay."
017.286 Then, rising and extending a solemn hand over the old man:
017.287 "By the blood of Christ, I swear I will not leave you until you are dead!"
017.288 Faria considered this young man, so noble, so simple, so elevated, and read on his features, animated by the expression of the purest devotion, the sincerity of his affection and the loyalty of his oath.
017.289 "Come," said the patient, "I accept; thank you."
017.290 Then, holding out his hand:
017.291 "Perhaps you will be rewarded for such selfless devotion," he said to him; "but as I cannot and you will not leave, it is important that we plug up the underground made under the gallery: the soldier may discover as he walks the sound of the mined place, call the attention of an inspector, and then we would be discovered and separated. Go and do this work, in which I can unfortunately no longer help you; employ the whole night in it, if necessary, and do not return until tomorrow morning after the visit of the gaoler, I shall have something important to say to you."
017.292 Dantes took the hand of the abbot, who reassured him with a smile, and went out with that obedience and respect which he had devoted to his old friend.
018.000 The treasure.
018.001 When Dantes returned the next morning to the room of his fellow prisoner, he found Faria sitting with a calm face.
018.002 Under the ray that slid through the narrow window of his cell, he held open in his left hand, the only one, it should be remembered, whose use had remained with him, a piece of paper, to which the habit of being rolled into a thin volume had imprinted the shape of a cylinder rebellious to be extended.
018.003 He showed the paper to Dantes without saying anything.
018.004 "What is this?" asked the latter.
018.005 --Read it well, said the abbot, smiling.
018.006 --I look with all my eyes, said Dantes, and I see nothing but a half-burned paper, and on which are traced Gothic characters with a singular ink.
018.007 --This paper, my friend," said Faria, "is, I can confess to you now, since I have tested you, this paper is my treasure, of which from today half belongs to you."
018.008 A cold sweat passed over Dantes' forehead. Up to this day, and for what a space of time! he had avoided speaking with Faria of this treasure, the source of the accusation of madness which weighed on the poor abbot; with his instinctive delicacy, Edmond had preferred not to touch this painfully vibrating string; and, on his side, Faria had been silent. He had taken the old man's silence for a return to reason; today, these few words, escaped by Faria after such a painful crisis, seemed to announce a serious relapse of insanity.
018.009 "Your treasure?" stammered Dantes.
018.010 Faria smiled.
018.011 "Yes," he said; "in every way you are a noble heart, Edmund, and I understand, by your pallor and your shudder, what is going on in you at this moment. No, rest assured, I am not mad. This treasure exists, Dantes, and if it was not given to me to possess it, you will possess it: nobody wanted to listen to me or believe me because I was judged to be mad; but you, who must know that I am not, listen to me, and you will believe me afterwards if you wish.
018.012 --Alas!" murmured Edmund to himself, "there he goes again! I missed this misfortune."
018.013 Then out loud:
018.014 "My friend," he said to Faria, "perhaps your access has tired you; will you not take a little rest? Tomorrow, if you wish, I will hear your story, but today I want to treat you, that's all. Besides," he continued, smiling, "is there any hurry for us to get a treasure?
018.015 --Highly urgent, Edmund!" replied the old man. Who knows if tomorrow, the day after tomorrow perhaps, the third attack will not arrive? Think that everything would be over then! Yes, it is true, I have often thought with bitter pleasure of those riches, which would make the fortune of ten families, lost to those men who persecuted me: this idea served as a revenge, and I savored it slowly in the night of my dungeon and in the despair of my captivity. But now that I have forgiven the world for the love of you, now that I see you young and full of future, now that I think of all the happiness that may result for you from such a revelation, I shudder at the delay, and I tremble at not assuring an owner so worthy as you are of the possession of so much buried wealth."
018.016 Edmond turned his head away with a sigh.
018.017 "You persist in your incredulity, Edmond," continued Faria, "my voice has not convinced you? I see that you need proof. Well, read this paper which I have not shown to anyone.
018.018 -- Tomorrow, my friend," said Edmund, reluctant to lend himself to the old man's folly; "I thought it was agreed that we would not speak of this until tomorrow.
018.019 --We won't talk about it until tomorrow, but read this paper today.
018.020 --Let's not irritate him," thought Edmund.
018.021 And, taking the paper, half of which was missing, consumed as it probably had been by some accident, he read.
018.022 _That treasure which may amount to two_ _Roman ecus in the most el_ _corner of the second opening, which_ _declares to be his in all pro_ _tier_ _25 April 149_.
018.023 "Well," said Faria when the young man had finished reading.
018.024 --But, replied Dantes, I see only truncated lines, words without continuation; the characters are interrupted by the action of fire and remain unintelligible.
018.025 --For you, my friend, who are reading them for the first time, but not for me, who have swooned over them for many nights, who have reconstructed every sentence, completed every thought.
018.026 --And you think you have found this suspended meaning?
018.027 -- I am sure of it, you will judge for yourself; but first listen to the story of this paper.
018.028 --Silence! exclaimed Dantes.... Footsteps!... One approaches... I leave.... Farewell!"
018.029 And Dantes, happy to escape the story and explanation which would not have failed to confirm to him the misfortune of his friend, slipped like a snake through the narrow corridor, while Faria, rendered to a sort of activity by terror, pushed back with his foot the slab which he covered with a mat in order to conceal from the eyes the solution of continuity which he had not had time to make disappear
018.030 It was the governor who, having learned by the jailer the accident of Faria, came to ensure by himself of its gravity.
018.031 Faria received him sitting, avoided any compromising gesture, and managed to hide from the governor the paralysis which had already struck half of his person with death. His fear was that the governor, moved by pity for him, would want to put him in a healthier prison and thus separate him from his young companion; but fortunately it was not so, and the governor withdrew convinced that his poor fool, for whom he felt in his heart a certain affection, was only suffering from a slight indisposition.
018.032 Meanwhile, Edmund, sitting on his bed and with his head in his hands, tried to gather his thoughts; everything was so reasoned, so great and so logical in Faria since he had known him, that he could not understand this supreme wisdom on all points allied to unreason on one: was it Faria who was mistaken about his treasure, was it all the world who was mistaken about Faria?
018.033 Dantes remained at home all day, not daring to return to his friend. He was trying to postpone the moment when he would become certain that the abbot was mad. This conviction must have been frightening for him.
018.034 But towards evening, after the hour of the ordinary visit, Faria, not seeing the young man return, tried to cross the space which separated him from him. Edmund shivered as he heard the painful efforts of the old man to drag himself: his leg was inert, and he could no longer help himself with his arm. Edmond was obliged to draw him to himself, for he could never have gone out alone through the narrow opening which gave into Dantes' room.
018.035 "Here I am, ruthlessly in pursuit of you," he said with a smile beaming with benevolence. You thought you could escape my magnificence, but you will not. Listen, then."
018.036 Edmund saw that he could not retreat; he made the old man sit down on his bed, and placed himself beside him on his stepladder.
018.037 "You know," said the abbot, "that I was the secretary, the familiar, the friend of Cardinal Spada, the last of the princes of that name. I owe to this worthy lord all that I have tasted of happiness in this life. He was not rich although the wealth of his family was proverbial and I often heard it said: Rich as a Spada. But he, like the public noise, lived on this reputation of opulence. His palace was my paradise. I educated his nephews, who are dead, and when he was alone in the world, I returned to him, by an absolute devotion to his wishes, all that he had done for me for ten years.
018.038 "The cardinal's house soon had no more secrets for me; I had often seen Monseigneur working at compiling antique books and eagerly digging in the dust of family manuscripts. One day, when I was reproaching him for his useless vigils and the sort of despondency that followed them, he looked at me with a bitter smile and opened a book which is the history of the city of Rome. There, in the twentieth chapter of the Life of Pope Alexander VI, were the following lines, which I have never been able to forget:
018.039 "The great wars of the Romagna were over. Caesar Borgia, who had completed his conquest, needed money to buy the whole of Italy. The pope also needed money to finish with Louis XII, king of France, still terrible in spite of his last reverses. It was thus a question of making a good speculation, which became difficult in this poor exhausted Italy.
018.040 "His Holiness had an idea. She resolved to make two cardinals.
018.041 "By choosing two of the great figures of Rome, two rich ones especially, this is what the Holy Father got out of the speculation: first of all, he had to sell the great offices and the magnificent jobs of which these two cardinals were in possession; moreover, he could count on a very brilliant price from the sale of these two hats.
018.042 "There remained a third part of speculation, which would soon appear.
018.043 "The pope and Caesar Borgia first found the two future cardinals: this was John Rospigliosi, who alone held four of the highest dignities in the Holy See, and then Caesar Spada, one of the noblest and richest Romans. Both of them felt the price of such a favor from the pope. They were ambitious. Those found, Caesar soon found purchasers for their offices.
018.044 "The result was that Rospigliosi and Spada paid to be cardinals, and eight others paid to be what were previously the two newly created cardinals. It entered eight hundred thousand ecus in the coffers of the speculators.
018.045 "Let us pass to the last part of the speculation, it is time. The Pope having showered Rospigliosi and Spada with caresses, having conferred on them the insignia of the cardinalate, sure that they had had to, in order to discharge the not fictitious debt of their recognition, bring together and realize their fortune in order to settle in Rome, the Pope and Caesar Borgia invited these two cardinals to dinner.
018.046 "This was the subject of a dispute between the Holy Father and his son: Caesar thought that one could use one of those means which he always kept at the disposal of his intimate friends, namely: first, the famous key with which some people were asked to go and open a certain cupboard. This key was equipped with a small iron point, negligence of the workman. When one forced to open the cupboard, whose lock was difficult, one pricked himself with this small point, and one died of it the following day. There was also the ring with the head of a lion, which Caesar put on his finger when he gave certain handshakes. The lion bit the skin of these favored hands, and the bite was fatal after twenty-four hours.
018.047 "Caesar therefore proposed to his father either to send the cardinals to open the cupboard or to give each of them a cordial handshake, but Alexander VI replied:
018.048 "--Let us not look at a dinner when it is a question of these excellent Cardinals Spada and Rospigliosi. Something tells me that we will win back that money. Besides, you forget, Caesar, that an indigestion starts right away, while a sting or a bite only ends up after a day or two.
018.049 "Caesar agreed with this reasoning. That is why the cardinals were invited to the dinner.
018.050 "The table was set in the vineyard owned by the pope near St. Peter's, a charming place that the cardinals knew well by reputation.
018.051 "Rospigliosi, all dazed by his new dignity, prepared his stomach and his best appearance. Spada, a prudent man who loved only his nephew, a young captain of the most beautiful hope, took paper, a quill, and made his will.
018.052 "He then told his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard, but it seems that the servant did not find him.
018.053 "Spada knew the custom of invitations. Since Christianity, eminently civilizing, had brought its progress to Rome, it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant to tell you, 'Caesar wants you to die'; but it was a legate _a latere_, who came, with a smiling mouth, to tell you from the pope, 'His Holiness wants you to dine with him."
018.054 "Spada left about two o'clock for the vineyard of St. Peter's; the pope was waiting for him there. The first figure that struck Spada's eyes was that of his nephew all adorned, all gracious, to whom Caesar Borgia was lavishing caresses. Spada paled; and Caesar, who gave him a look full of irony, let it be seen that he had foreseen everything, that the trap was well set.
018.055 "One dined. Spada could only ask his nephew: "Did you receive my message?" The nephew answered that he had not and understood perfectly the value of this question: it was too late, for he had just drunk a glass of excellent wine set apart for him by the pope's sommelier. At the same time, Spada saw another bottle approaching and was offered it liberally. An hour later, a doctor declared them both poisoned by poisonous morels, Spada died on the threshold of the vineyard, the nephew expired at his door making a sign that his wife did not understand.
018.056 "Immediately Caesar and the Pope rushed to invade the inheritance, under the pretext of searching for the papers of the deceased. But the inheritance consisted of this: a piece of paper on which Spada had written:
018.057 "I bequeath to my beloved nephew my chests, my books, among them my beautiful breviary with gold corners, wishing him to keep this memory of his beloved uncle.
018.058 "The heirs searched everywhere, admired the breviary, took possession of the furniture and were astonished that Spada, the rich man, was in fact the most miserable of the uncles; there were no treasures, except for the treasures of science contained in the library and the laboratories.
018.059 "That was all. Caesar and his father searched and searched and spied; nothing was found, or at least very little: for a thousand écus, perhaps, of silverware, and for about as much coined money; but the nephew had had time to say on returning to his wife:
018.060 "Search among my uncle's papers, there is a _real will._
018.061 "One sought even more actively perhaps than the august heirs had done. It was in vain: there remained two palaces and a vineyard behind the Palatine. But at that time real estate was of little value; the two palaces and the vineyard remained in the family, as unworthy of the rapacity of the pope and his son.
018.062 "Months and years passed. Alexander VI died poisoned, you know by what mistake; Caesar, poisoned at the same time as he was, had to change his skin like a snake, and put on a new envelope in which the poison had left stains similar to those seen on the fur of the tiger; finally, forced to leave Rome, he went to be killed obscurely in a night skirmish and almost forgotten by history.
018.063 "After the death of the pope, after the exile of his son, it was generally expected that the family would resume the princely life it had led in the time of cardinal Spada; but this was not so. The Spadas remained in doubtful ease, an eternal mystery hung over this dark affair, and the public rumor was that Caesar, a better politician than his father, had taken away from the pope the fortunes of the two cardinals; I say of the two, because Cardinal Rospigliosi, who had taken no precautions, was stripped completely.
018.064 "So far," interrupted Faria, smiling, "this does not seem too foolish to you, does it?
018.065 --O my friend," said Dantes, "it seems to me that I am reading, on the contrary, a chronicle full of interest. Please continue.
018.066 -- I will continue:
018.067 "The family became accustomed to this obscurity. The years passed; among the descendants some were soldiers, others diplomats; some churchmen, others bankers; some became rich, others finished ruining themselves. I arrive at the last of the family, to the one of whom I was the secretary, to the Count of Spada.
018.068 "I had often heard him complain about the disproportion of his fortune to his rank, so I gave him the advice to invest the little he had left in life annuities; he followed this advice and thus doubled his income.
018.069 "The famous breviary had remained in the family, and it was the Count of Spada who owned it: it had been kept from father to son, for the strange clause in the only will that had been found had made it a real relic guarded with superstitious veneration in the family; it was a book illuminated with the most beautiful Gothic figures, and so heavy with gold that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity.
018.070 "At the sight of the papers of all kinds, titles, contracts, parchments, which one kept in the archives of the family and which all came from the poisoned cardinal, I put myself in my turn, like twenty servants, twenty stewards, twenty secretaries who had preceded me, to compile the formidable bundles: in spite of the activity and the religion of my research, I found absolutely nothing. However I had read, I had even written an exact and almost ephemeral history of the family of Borgia, with the only purpose to make sure if an additional fortune had happened to these princes to the death of my cardinal César Spada, and I had noticed there only the addition of the goods of the cardinal Rospigliosi, his companion of misfortune.
018.071 "I was therefore quite sure that the inheritance had not benefited either the Borgias or the family, but had remained without a master, like those treasures of the Arabian tales which sleep in the bosom of the earth under the gaze of a genius. I searched, I counted, I estimated a thousand and one times the income and expenses of the family for three hundred years: all was useless, I remained in my ignorance, and the Count of Spada in his misery.
018.072 "My boss died. Of his life annuity he had excepted his family papers, his library, composed of five thousand volumes, and his famous breviary. He bequeathed all this to me, together with a thousand Roman ecus that he had in cash, on condition that I would have anniversary masses said and that I would draw up a family tree and a history of his house, which I did exactly....
018.073 "Don't worry, my dear Edmond, we are nearing the end.
018. 074 "In 1807, a month before my arrest and fifteen days after the death of the Count of Spada, on the 25th of December, you will understand in a moment how the date of this memorable day remained in my memory, I reread for the thousandth time these papers that I coordinated, because, the palace belonging henceforth to a foreigner, I was about to leave Rome to go and settle in Florence, taking with me a dozen thousand books that I owned, my library and my famous breviary, when, tired of this assiduous study, badly disposed by a rather heavy dinner that I had made, I let my head fall on my two hands and fell asleep: It was three o'clock in the afternoon.
018.075 "I woke up as the clock struck six.
018.076 "I looked up, I was in the deepest darkness. I rang for light, but no one came, so I decided to help myself. It was, moreover, a philosopher's habit that I would have to adopt. I took in one hand a candle all prepared, and with the other I sought, in the absence of matches absent from their box, a paper which I intended to light with a last remainder of flame above the hearth; But, fearing in the darkness to take a precious paper instead of a useless one, I hesitated, when I remembered to have seen, in the famous breviary which was placed on the table beside me, an old paper all yellow by the top, which seemed to serve as a bookmark, and which had crossed the centuries maintained in its place by the veneration of the heirs. I groped for this useless sheet, found it, twisted it, and, presenting it to the dying flame, lit it.
018.077 "But, under my fingers, as if by magic, as the fire rose, I saw yellowish characters emerge from the white paper and appear on the sheet; then terror overcame me: I clutched the paper in my hands, smothered the fire, lit the candle directly in the hearth, reopened the crumpled letter with unspeakable emotion, and recognized that a mysterious and sympathetic ink had traced these letters apparent only by contact with the lively heat. A little more than a third of the paper had been consumed by the flame: it is this paper that you read this morning; read it again, Dantes; then when you have read it again, I will complete for you the interrupted sentences and the incomplete meaning."
018.078 And Faria, interrupting, offered the paper to Dantes, who this time eagerly reread the following words traced with a reddish ink, similar to rust:
018. 079 _Today, April 25, 1498, have_ _Alexander VI, and fearing that, not_ _he would like to inherit from me, and that he would re_ _and Bentivoglio, who died of poisoning_, _my universal legatee, whom I have enf_ _to have visited with me, that is to say, in_ _the island of Monte Cristo, all that I pos_ _gold, diamonds, jewelry; that only_ _can go up to about two mil_ _find having raised the twentieth roch_ _creek of the East in a straight line. Two openu_ _in these caves: the treasure is in the most é_ _which treasure I bequeath and cede to him in tou_ _sole heir_. April 25, 1498_ _CES_
018.080 "Now," continued the abbot, "read this other paper." And he presented Dantes with a second sheet with other fragments of lines. Dantes took it and read:
018. 081 _Having been invited to dinner by His Holiness_ _content to have me pay for the hat_, _serves the fate of the Crapara Cardinals_ _I declare to my nephew Guido Spada_, _yes in a place known to him_ _the caves of the little_ _sedges of ingots, of gold coined, of pier_ _I know the existence of this treasure, which_ _lions of Roman ecus, and that it_ _e, from the small_ _res were practiced_ _far from the second_, _your property as to my_ AR-SPADA
018.082 Faria followed him with an ardent eye.
018.083 "And now," he said, when he had seen that Dantes had reached the last line, "bring the two fragments together, and judge for yourself."
018.084 Dantes obeyed; the two fragments brought together gave the following whole:
018.085 "Today, April 25, 1498, having... been invited to dinner by His Holiness Alexander VI, and fearing that, not... content with having made me pay for the hat, he would want to inherit me and would not re... serve me the fate of the cardinals Crapara and Bentivoglio, who died of poisoning,... I declare to my nephew Guido Spada, my universal legatee, that I have in... I declare to my nephew Guido Spada, my universal legatee, that I have in a place that he knows for having visited it with me, that is to say in... the caves of the small island of Monte Cristo, all that I pos... sedate of ingots, coined gold, gems, diamonds jewels; that alone. I know the existence of this treasure, which may amount to about two thousand lions of Roman ecus, and which he will find having raised the twentieth rock from the small eastern creek in a straight line. Two openings have been made in these caves... The treasure is in the farthest corner of the second one, which treasure I bequeath and cede to him in full ownership, as to my sole heir.
018.086 "April 25, 1498
018.087 "CESAR.... SPADA."
018.088 "Well, do you understand at last?" said Faria.
018.089 --This was the declaration of the cardinal Spada and the testament which one sought for so a long time? says Edmond still incredulous.
018.090 --Yes, a thousand times yes.
018.091 --Who has reconstructed it in this way?
018.092 -- I, who, with the help of the remaining fragment, guessed the rest by measuring the length of the lines by the length of the paper and by penetrating the hidden sense by means of the visible sense, as one guides oneself in an underground passage by a remnant of light that comes from above.
018.093 --And what did you do when you thought you had acquired this conviction?
018.094 -- I wanted to leave and I left at once, taking with me the beginning of my great work on the unity of a kingdom of Italy; but for a long time the imperial police, who at that time, contrary to what Napoleon wanted since, when a son was born to him, wanted the division of the provinces, had their eyes on me: my precipitous departure, the cause of which they were far from guessing, aroused their suspicions, and at the moment I was embarking at Piombino I was arrested.
018.095 "Now," continued Faria, looking at Dantes with an almost paternal expression, "now, my friend, you know as much as I do: if we ever run away together, half of my treasure is yours; and if I die here and you run away alone, it is all yours.
018.096 --But, asked Dantes hesitatingly, doesn't this treasure have a more legitimate possessor in this world than us?
018.097 --But no, rest assured, the family is completely extinct; the last Count of Spada, moreover, made me his heir; by bequeathing me this symbolic breviary he bequeathed me what it contained; no, no, don't worry: if we get our hands on this fortune, we can enjoy it without remorse.
018.098 --And you say that this treasure contains ....
018.099 --Two million Roman ecus, about thirteen million of our currency.
018.100 --Impossible!" said Dantes, frightened by the enormity of the sum.
018.101 --Impossible! And why? The Spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century. Besides, in those times when all speculation and industry were absent, these agglomerations of gold and jewels are not rare, there are still today Roman families who starve near a million in diamonds and gems transmitted by majorate, and to which they cannot touch."
018.102 Edmund thought he was dreaming: he floated between disbelief and joy.
018.103 "I have kept the secret so long with you," continued Faria, "first only to test you, and then to surprise you; if we had escaped before my fit of catalepsy, I would have led you to Monte Cristo; now," he added with a sigh, "it is you who will lead me there. Well, Dantes, don't you thank me?
018.104 --This treasure belongs to you, my friend, said Dantes, it belongs to you alone, and I have no right to it: I am not your relative.
018.105 --You are my son, Dantes!" cried the old man, "you are the child of my captivity; my state condemned me to celibacy: God has sent you to me to console both the man who could not be a father and the prisoner who could not be free.
018.106 And Faria held out his remaining arm to the young man, who threw himself around his neck, weeping.
019.000 The third access.
019. 001 Now that this treasure, which had been so long the object of the abbot's meditations, could assure the future happiness of him whom Faria truly loved as his son, it had again doubled in value in his eyes; every day he dwelt on the quantity of this treasure, explaining to Dantes all that with thirteen or fourteen millions of fortune a man in our modern times could do good to his friends; and then the face of Dantes became brown, because the oath of vengeance which he had made represented itself to his thought, and he thought him, how much in our modern times also a man with thirteen or fourteen million of fortune could make of evil to his enemies.
019.002 The abbot did not know the island of Monte Cristo, but Dantes knew it: he had often passed in front of this island, situated at twenty-five miles from the Pianosa, between Corsica and the island of Elba, and once he had even released there. This island was, had always been and is still completely deserted; it is a rock of almost conical shape, which seems to have been pushed by some volcanic cataclysm from the bottom of the abyss to the surface of the sea.
019.003 Dantes made the plan of the island to Faria, and Faria gave advice to Dantes on the means to be employed to find the treasure.
019.004 But Dantes was far from being as enthusiastic and especially as confident as the old man. Certainly, he was quite certain now that Faria was not mad, and the way in which he had arrived at the discovery which had made him believe in his madness redoubled his admiration for him; but he could not believe that this deposit, supposing it had existed, still existed, and, when he did not look at the treasure as chimerical, he at least looked at it as absent.
019.005 However, as if fate had wanted to take away the prisoners' last hope and make them understand that they were condemned to a perpetual prison, a new misfortune befell them: the gallery on the edge of the sea, which for a long time had been threatening ruin, had been rebuilt; the foundations had been repaired and the hole already half-filled by Dantes had been plugged up with enormous quarters of rock. Without this precaution, which had been suggested, it is remembered, to the young man by the abbot, their misfortune was much greater still, for their attempt at escape was discovered, and they were undoubtedly separated: a new door, stronger, more inexorable than the others, had thus still closed upon them.
019.006 "You see well," said the young man with sweet sadness to Faria, "that God wants to take away from me even the merit of what you call my devotion to you. I promised to stay with you forever, and I am not free now to break my promise; I will have no more treasure than you, and neither of us will leave here. Besides, my real treasure, you see, my friend, is not the one that was waiting for me under the dark rocks of Monte Cristo, it is your presence, it is our cohabitation of five or six hours a day, in spite of our gaolers; it is these rays of intelligence that you have poured into my brain, these languages that you have implanted in my memory and which grow there with all their philological ramifications. These various sciences that you have made so easy for me by the depth of knowledge that you have and the clearness of the principles in which you have reduced them, here is my treasure, friend, here is what you have made me rich and happy. Believe me and console yourself, this is better for me than tons of gold and crates of diamonds, even if they are not problematic, like those clouds that one sees in the morning floating on the sea, which one takes for firm land, and which evaporate, vanish and vanish as one approaches them. To have you near me as long as possible, to listen to your eloquent voice to adorn my mind, to temper my soul, to make my whole organization capable of great and terrible things if ever I am free, to fill it so well that the despair to which I was ready to let myself go when I knew you no longer finds a place in it, this is my fortune: This one is not chimerical; I owe it to you very truly, and all the sovereigns of the earth, even if they were Caesar Borgia, would not be able to take it from me. "
019.007 Thus, it was for the two unfortunate ones, if not happy days, at least days quite promptly passed away that the days that followed. Faria, who for so many long years had kept silent about the treasure, now spoke of it at every opportunity. As he had foreseen, he had remained paralyzed in his right arm and left leg, and had pretty much lost all hope of enjoying it himself; but he still dreamed for his young companion of a deliverance or escape, and he enjoyed it for him. Lest the letter should one day be mislaid or lost, he had forced Dantes to learn it by heart, and Dantes knew it from the first word to the last. Then he had destroyed the second part, certain that the first part could be found and understood without guessing its true meaning. Sometimes whole hours were spent by Faria in giving instructions to Dantes, instructions which were to serve him on the day of his freedom. Then, once free, of the day, of the hour, of the moment when he would be free, he was to have only one thought, to reach Monte Cristo by some means, to remain there alone under a pretext that would not give rise to suspicion, and, once there, once alone, to try to find the marvelous caves and to search the place indicated. The indicated place, one remembers it, it is the most distant angle of the second opening.
019.008 Meanwhile, the hours passed, if not fast, at least bearable. Faria, as we have said, without having recovered the use of his hand and foot, had regained all the sharpness of his intelligence, and had gradually, besides the moral knowledge which we have detailed, taught his young companion that patient and sublime trade of the prisoner, who from nothing knows how to make something. Thus they occupied themselves eternally, Faria for fear of seeing himself grow old, Dantes for fear of remembering his past, which was almost extinguished, and which floated no more in the depths of his memory than a distant light lost in the night; all went on like this, as in those existences where misfortune has disturbed nothing and which flow mechanically and calmly under the eye of Providence.
019.009 But underneath this superficial calm, there were in the heart of the young man, and in that of the old man perhaps, many restrained impulses, many sighs stifled, which came to light when Faria was left alone and Edmond had returned home.
019.010 One night Edmund woke up with a start, thinking he had heard himself called.
019.011 He opened his eyes and tried to penetrate the darkness.
019.012 His name, or rather a plaintive voice that tried to articulate his name, reached him.
019.013 He got up on his bed, the sweat of anguish on his forehead, and listened. There was no longer any doubt that the complaint was coming from his companion's dungeon.
019.014 "Great God!" murmured Dantes; "could it be...?
019.015 And he moved his bed, pulled the stone, dashed down the corridor and reached the opposite end; the slab was up.
019.016 In the light of that shapeless, flickering lamp of which we have spoken, Edmund saw the pale old man, still standing and clutching the wood of his bed. His features were upset by those horrible symptoms which he already knew and which had frightened him so much when they had first appeared.
019.017 "Well, my friend," said Faria resignedly, "you understand, don't you? and I don't need to teach you anything!"
019.018 Edmund gave a painful cry, and losing his head completely, he rushed to the door, shouting:
019.019 "Help! Help!"
019.020 Faria still had the strength to stop him by the arm.
019.021 "Silence!" he said, "or you are lost. Let us think only of you my friend, to make your captivity bearable or your escape possible. It would take years for you to redo alone all that I have done here, and which would be destroyed at once by the knowledge that our overseers would have of our intelligence. Besides, rest assured, my friend, the dungeon I am about to leave will not remain empty for long: another unfortunate will come to take my place. To this other one, you will appear as a saving angel. This one will perhaps be young, strong and patient like you, this one will be able to help you in your escape, whereas I prevented it. You will no longer have half a corpse tied to you to paralyze all your movements. Decidedly, God is doing something for you at last: he is giving you back more than he is taking away, and it is high time I died."
019.022 Edmund could only join his hands and exclaim:
019.023 "Oh, my friend, my friend, be quiet!"
019.024 Then regaining his strength for a moment shaken by this unexpected blow and his courage bent by the old man's words:
019.025 "Oh!" he said, "I have already saved you once, I will save you again!"
019.026 And he lifted the foot of the bed and drew from it the bottle still a third full of the red liquor.
019.027 "Here," he said, "there is still some of that saving drink left. Quickly, quickly, tell me what I must do this time; are there any new instructions? Speak, my friend, I am listening.
019.028 --There is no hope, replied Faria, shaking his head; but no matter; God wants the man he has created, and in whose heart he has so deeply rooted the love of life, to do all he can to preserve this existence, so painful at times, so dear always.
019.029 --Oh, yes, yes," cried Dantes, "and I will save you, I tell you!
019.030 -- Well, try it! The cold is getting to me; I feel the blood rushing to my brain; that horrible tremor which makes my teeth chatter and seems to disjoin my bones is beginning to shake my whole body; in five minutes the evil will burst, in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a corpse.
019.031 --Oh!" cried Dantes, his heart full of pain.
019.032 -- You will do as you did the first time, only you will not wait so long. All the springs of life are well worn at this hour, and death," he continued, pointing to his paralyzed arm and leg, "will have only half the work to do. If after pouring twelve drops into my mouth, instead of ten, you see that I do not come back, then you will pour the rest. Now carry me to my bed, for I can no longer stand."
019.033 Edmund took the old man in his arms and laid him on the bed.
019.034 "Now friend," said Faria, "the only consolation of my miserable life, you whom heaven has given me a little late, but at last it has given me, an invaluable present and one for which I thank it; at the moment of parting from you for ever, I wish you all the happiness, all the prosperity you deserve: my son I bless you!"
019.035 The young man threw himself on his knees, leaning his head against the old man's bed.
019.036 "But above all, listen well to what I say to you at this supreme moment: the treasure of the Spada exists; God allows that there is no more for me neither distance nor obstacle. I see it at the bottom of the second cave; my eyes pierce the depths of the earth and are dazzled by so much wealth. If you manage to flee, remember that the poor abbot that everyone thought was crazy was not. Run to Monte Cristo, take advantage of our fortune, enjoy it, you have suffered enough."
019.037 A violent jolt interrupted the old man; Dantes raised his head, he saw the eyes that were injected with red: it seemed as if a wave of blood had just risen from his chest to his forehead.
019.038 "Farewell! Farewell!" murmured the old man, pressing the young man's hand convulsively, "Farewell!
019.039 --Oh! not yet, not yet!" cried the latter; "do not abandon us, O God! help him... to me....
019.040 --Silence! silence! murmured the dying man, let us not be separated if you save me!
019.041 -- You are right. Oh, yes, yes, rest assured, I will save you! Besides, although you suffer a lot, you seem to suffer less than the first time.
019.042 --Oh, think again! I suffer less, because I have less strength to suffer. At your age one has faith in life; it is the privilege of youth to believe and hope, but old people see death more clearly. Oh! here it comes... it is finished... my sight is lost... my reason flees.... Your hand, Dantes!... farewell!... farewell!"
019.043 And rising by a last effort in which he gathered all his faculties.
019.044 "Monte Cristo!" he said, "do not forget Monte Cristo!
019.045 And he fell back on his bed. The crisis was terrible: twisted limbs, swollen eyelids, bloody foam, a body without movement, that is what remained on that bed of pain in place of the intelligent being who had lain there a moment before.
019.046 Dantes took the lamp and placed it at the head of the bed on a protruding stone, from which its trembling glow illuminated the decomposed face and the inert, stiffened body with a strange and fantastic reflection.
019.047 With his eyes fixed, he waited fearlessly for the moment to administer the saving remedy.
019.048 When he thought the moment had arrived, he took the knife, loosened his teeth, which offered less resistance than the first time, counted ten drops one after the other, and waited; the vial still contained about double what he had poured.
019.049 He waited ten minutes, a quarter of an hour, half an hour, nothing moved. Trembling, his hair stiffened, his forehead frozen with sweat, he counted the seconds by the beating of his heart.
019.050 Then he thought it was time to try the last test: he brought the vial close to Faria's purple lips, and, without needing to unclench the jaws that had remained open, he poured out all the liquor it contained.
019.051 The remedy produced a galvanic effect, a violent tremor shook the old man's limbs, his eyes opened again, frightening to see, he sighed, which resembled a cry, and then the whole shivering body gradually returned to its immobility.
019.052 Only the eyes remained open.
019.053 Half an hour, an hour, an hour and a half passed. During this hour and a half of anguish, Edmund, leaning over his friend, his hand applied to his heart, felt successively that body grow colder and that heart extinguish its increasingly deaf and deep beat.
019.054 Finally nothing survived; the last tremor of the heart ceased, the face became livid, the eyes remained open, but the glance became dull.
019.055 It was six o'clock in the morning, the day was beginning to appear, and its pale ray, invading the dungeon, made the dying light of the lamp pale. Strange reflections passed over the face of the corpse, giving it from time to time the appearance of life. As long as this struggle of day and night lasted, Dantes could still doubt; but as soon as the day had overcome, he understood that he was alone with a corpse.
019.056 Then a deep and invincible terror seized him; he no longer dared to press that hand which hung out of the bed, he no longer dared to stop his eyes on those fixed and white eyes which he tried several times but in vain to close, and which were always reopening. He turned off the lamp, hid it carefully, and fled, replacing the slab over his head as best he could.
019.057 Besides, it was time, the jailer was coming.
019.058 This time he began his visit with Dantes; on leaving his cell he was going to go to Faria's, to whom he brought lunch and linen.
019.059 There was no indication that he knew of the accident. He went out.
019.060 Dantes was then seized with an unspeakable impatience to know what was going to happen in his unfortunate friend's dungeon; he therefore entered the underground gallery and arrived in time to hear the exclamations of the key-holder, who was calling for help.
019.061 Soon the other key-bearers entered; then was heard that heavy and regular step usual to soldiers, even off duty. Behind the soldiers came the governor.
019.062 Edmund heard the sound of the bed on which the corpse was being shaken; he heard the voice of the governor, who ordered water to be thrown in his face, and who, seeing that, in spite of this immersion, the prisoner did not return, sent for the doctor.
019.063 The governor went out; and a few words of compassion reached the ears of Dantes, mingled with laughter of mockery.
019.064 "Come, come," said one, "the madman has gone to his treasures, have a good journey!
019.065 --He will not have enough money for his shroud with all his millions, said the other.
019.066 --Oh! resumed a third voice, the shrouds of the Château d'If are not expensive.
019.067 --Perhaps, said one of the first interlocutors, as he is a man of the Church, some expenses will be made in his favor.
019.068 --Then he will have the honors of the bag."
019.069 Edmond listened, did not lose a word, but did not understand much of all this. Soon the voices died away, and it seemed to him that the attendants were leaving the room. However, he did not dare to go back in: they might have left some key-holder to guard the dead man.
019.070 So he remained mute, motionless and holding his breath.
019.071 After an hour or so, the silence was enlivened by a faint noise, which increased.
019.072 It was the governor returning, followed by the doctor and several officers.
019.073 There was a moment of silence: it was obvious that the doctor was approaching the bed and examining the corpse.
019.074 Soon the questions began.
019.075 The doctor analyzed the illness to which the prisoner had succumbed and declared him dead.
019.076 Questions and answers were made with a nonchalance that indignant Dantes; it seemed to him that everyone must feel for the poor abbot some of the affection he had for him.
019.077 "I am angry at what you are telling me," said the governor, responding to the doctor's certainty that the old man was really dead; he was a gentle prisoner, harmless, delightful with his madness, and above all easy to watch.
019.078 --Oh," said the key-holder, "he could have been left unguarded; he would have remained here for fifty years, I can vouch for that one, without making a single attempt to escape.
019.079 -- However," continued the governor, "I think it would be urgent, in spite of your conviction, not that I doubt your science, but for the sake of my own responsibility, to make sure that the prisoner is really dead.
019.080 There was a moment of absolute silence, during which Dantes, still listening, considered that the doctor was examining and palpating the corpse a second time.
019.081 "You can rest assured," said the doctor, "he is dead, I can vouch for that.
019.082 -- "You know, sir," continued the governor, insisting, "that we are not satisfied, in cases like this, with a simple examination; despite all appearances, please complete the task by fulfilling the formalities prescribed by law.
019.083 -- Let the irons be heated, said the doctor; but in truth, it is a very useless precaution."
019.084 This order to heat the irons made Dantes shudder.
019.085 Eager footsteps were heard, the creaking of the door, a few comings and goings inside, and, a few moments later, a teller returned, saying:
019.086 "Here is the brazier with an iron."
019.087 There was then silence for an instant, and then the quivering of burning flesh was heard, and its thick, nauseating odor pierced the very wall behind which Dantes listened with horror. At this smell of charred human flesh, sweat broke out on the young man's forehead, and he thought he would faint.
019.088 "You see, sir, that he is quite dead," said the doctor; "this burn on his heel is decisive: the poor fool is cured of his madness and delivered from his captivity.
019.089 -- Wasn't his name Faria?" asked one of the officers who accompanied the governor.
019.090 -- Yes, sir, and, as far as he could tell, it was an old name; besides, he was very learned and quite reasonable even on all points that did not touch his treasure; but on this one, it must be admitted, he was intractable.
019.091 --This is the condition we call monomania, said the doctor.
019.092 --You never had any complaints about him?" the governor asked the jailer in charge of bringing the abbot's food.
019.093 -- Never, Mr. Governor," replied the jailer, "never, never, on the contrary: in the past he even amused me greatly by telling me stories; one day when my wife was ill he even gave me a recipe that cured her.
019.094 --Ah! ah!" said the doctor, "I didn't know I was dealing with a colleague; I hope, Mr. Governor," he added, laughing, "that you will treat him accordingly.
019.095 -- Yes, yes, rest assured, he will be decently buried in the newest bag that can be found; are you satisfied?
019.096 --Do we have to perform this last formality before you, sir? asked a teller.
019.097 --Surely, but let's hurry, I can't stay in this room all day."
019.098 New comings and goings were heard; a moment later, a noise of crumpled cloth reached Dantes' ears, the bed screamed on its springs, a step weighed down like that of a man lifting a burden pressed on the slab, and then the bed screamed again under the weight that was returned to it.
019.099 "Until tonight," said the governor.
019.100 --Will there be a mass?" asked one of the officers.
019.101 --Impossible, replied the governor; the chaplain of the castle came to ask me yesterday for leave to make a short trip of eight days to Hyères, I answered him for all my prisoners during all that time; the poor abbot only had to not be in such a hurry, and he would have had his requiem.
019.102 --Bah! bah! Hyères said the doctor with the impiety familiar to people of his profession, he is a man of the Church: God will have regard to the state, and will not give hell the nasty pleasure of sending him a priest."
019.103 A burst of laughter followed this bad joke. Meanwhile, the burial operation continued.
019.104 "See you tonight!" said the governor when it was over.
019.105 -- At what time? asked the teller.
019.106 -- But about ten or eleven o'clock.
019.107 -- Will the dead man be watched over?
019.108 --For what purpose? We'll close the dungeon as if he were alive, that's all."
019.109 Then the footsteps receded, the voices grew fainter, the sound of the door with its shrill lock and creaking bolts was heard, a silence drearier than that of solitude, the silence of death, invaded everything, even the frozen soul of the young man.
019.110 Then he slowly lifted the slab with his head, and cast an inquiring glance into the room. The room was empty: Dantes left the gallery.
020.000 The cemetery of the Château d'If.
020.001 On the bed, lying lengthwise, and dimly lit by a foggy day which penetrated through the window, one could see a coarse canvas bag, under the wide folds of which a long, stiff form was confusedly outlined: it was Faria's last shroud, that shroud which, according to the tellers, cost so little. Thus, all was finished. A material separation already existed between Dantes and his old friend; he could no longer see his eyes, which had remained open as if to look beyond death; he could no longer shake that industrious hand which had lifted for him the veil that covered the hidden things. Faria, the useful, good companion to whom he had become so accustomed, existed only in his memory. Then he sat down at the bedside of this terrible bed, and plunged into a dark and bitter melancholy.
020.002 Alone! he had become alone again! he had fallen back into silence, he found himself facing nothingness!
020.003 Alone, no longer even the sight, no longer even the voice of the only human being who still attached him to the earth! Was it not better like Faria, to go and ask God for the enigma of life, at the risk of passing through the gloomy door of suffering!
020.004 The idea of suicide, chased away by his friend, dismissed by his presence, came back like a ghost near Faria's corpse.
020.005 "If I could die," he said, "I would go where he goes, and I would certainly find him. But how to die? It is very easy," he added, laughing; "I will stay here, I will throw myself on the first who enters, I will strangle him and they will guillotine me."
020.006 But, as it happens in great sorrows as in great storms, the abyss lies between two peaks of water, Dantes recoiled at the thought of this infamous death, and passed hastily from this despair to a burning thirst for life and liberty.
020.007 "To die! oh, no," he cried, "it is not worth having lived so much, having suffered so much, to die now! To die was good when I had resolved to do so, years ago; but now it would be too much to help my miserable destiny. No, I want to live, I want to fight to the end; no, I want to regain the happiness that has been taken away from me! Before I die, I forgot that I have my executioners to punish, and perhaps also, who knows? some friends to reward. But now I am going to be forgotten here, and I will only come out of my dungeon as Faria."
020.008 But at this word Edmond remained motionless, his eyes fixed like a man struck by a sudden idea, but which this idea frightens; suddenly he rose, brought his hand to his forehead as if he had vertigo, made two or three turns in the room and came back to stop before the bed....
020.009 "Oh! oh!" he murmured, "who sends me this thought? is it you, my God? Since it is only the dead who leave here freely, let us take the place of the dead."
020. 010 And without losing time to reconsider this decision, as if not to give the thought the dullness of destroying this desperate resolution, he bent over the hideous bag, opened it with the knife Faria had made, took the corpse out of the bag, took it home, laid it in his bed, covered it with the flap of linen he used to cover himself with, covered it with his blanket, kissed the cold forehead one last time, tried to close those rebellious eyes, which continued to remain open, frightening by the absence of thought, turned his head along the wall so that the jailer, bringing his evening meal, would think he was in bed, as was often his habit, went into the gallery, pulled the bed against the wall, returned to the other room, took the needle and thread from the cupboard, threw away his rags so that one could feel the naked flesh under the cloth, slipped into the gutted sack, placed himself in the situation where the corpse was, and closed the seam inside.
020.011 One could have heard his heart beating if by misfortune one had entered at that moment.
020.012 Dantes could have waited until after the evening visit, but he was afraid that by then the governor would have changed his mind and the corpse would have been removed.
020.013 Then his last hope was lost.
020.014 At any rate, now his plan was set.
020.015 This is what he intended to do.
020.016 If during the journey the gravediggers recognized that they were carrying a living person instead of a dead one, Dantes did not give them time to recognize each other; with a vigorous stroke of his knife he opened the sack from the top to the bottom, took advantage of their terror and escaped; if they wanted to stop him, he played with the knife.
020.017 If they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave, he let himself be covered with earth; then, as it was night, as soon as the gravediggers had turned their backs, he opened a passage through the soft earth and ran away: he hoped that the weight would not be too great for him to lift.
020.018 If he was mistaken, if on the contrary the earth was too heavy, he would die suffocated, and, so much the better!
020.019 Dantes had not eaten since the day before, but he had not thought of hunger in the morning, and he still did not think about it. His position was too precarious to give him time to stop his thoughts on any other idea.
020.020 The first danger that Dantes ran was that the jailer, in bringing him his seven o'clock supper, would notice the substitution that had been made; fortunately, twenty times, either through misanthropy or fatigue, Dantes had received the jailer in bed; and in this case, usually, this man would place his bread and soup on the table and retire without speaking to him.
020.021 But this time the jailer could break his habit of silence, speak to Dantes, and seeing that Dantes did not answer him, approach the bed and discover everything.
020.022 When seven o'clock in the evening approached, Dantes' anguish really began. His hand, resting on his heart, wiped away the beating of it, while with the other he wiped away the sweat from his forehead that trickled down his temples. From time to time shivers ran through his body and tightened his heart as in an icy vice. Then he thought he was going to die. The hours passed without bringing any movement in the castle, and Dantes understood that he had escaped this first danger; it was a good omen. At last, about the time fixed by the governor, footsteps were heard on the staircase. Edmond understood that the moment had come; he summoned up all his courage, holding his breath; happy if he could have held back at the same time and like her the precipitate pulsations of his arteries.
020.023 They stopped at the door, the step was double. Dantes guessed that it was the two gravediggers who had come to fetch him. This suspicion turned into certainty when he heard the noise they made as they deposited the stretcher.
020.024 The door opened, a veiled light reached Dantes' eyes. Through the cloth that covered him, he saw two shadows approaching his bed. A third at the door, holding a torch in his hand. Each of the two men, who had approached the bed, seized the bag by one of its ends.
020.025 "It's still heavy, for such a thin old man!" said one of them, lifting it by the head.
020.026 --They say that each year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones, said the other, taking him by the feet.
020.027 --Have you tied your knot? asked the first.
020.028 --I would be a fool to burden us with a useless weight, said the second, I will do it there.
020.029 --You're right; let's go then."
020.030 "Why this knot?" asked Dantes.
020.031 The so-called dead man was carried from the bed onto the stretcher.
020.032 Edmond stiffened to better play his role of the deceased.
020.033 He was placed on the stretcher; and the procession, illuminated by the man with the falot, who walked ahead, went up the stairs.
020.034 Suddenly, the cool, harsh night air flooded him. Dantes recognized the mistral. It was a sudden sensation, full of both delight and anguish.
020.035 The porters took about twenty steps, then stopped and laid the stretcher on the ground.
020.036 One of the porters moved away, and Dantes heard his shoes clacking on the flagstones.
020.037 "Where am I?" he asked himself.
020.038 "Do you know that he is not light at all!" said the one who had remained near Dantes, sitting down on the edge of the stretcher.
020.039 The first feeling of Dantes had been to escape, fortunately, he held back.
020.040 "Give me some light, then, animal," said the one of the two porters who had moved away, "or I shall never find what I am looking for."
020.041 The man with the falot obeyed the injunction, although, as we have seen, it was made in less than suitable terms.
020.042 "What is he looking for?" asked Dantes. A spade, no doubt."
020.043 An exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the gravedigger had found what he was looking for.
020.044 "Well," said the other, "it is not without difficulty.
020.045 --Yes," he replied, "but he will have lost nothing by waiting."
020.046 At these words he drew nearer to Edmund, who heard a heavy, resounding body being laid near him; at the same moment a rope surrounded his feet with a sharp, painful pressure.
020.047 "Well, is the knot tied?" asked the gravedigger who had remained inactive.
020.048 --And well done, said the other; I'll vouch for that.
020.049 -- In that case, let's go."
020.050 And the lifted stretcher went on its way.
020.051 They walked about fifty steps, then stopped to open a door, then set off again. The sound of the waves breaking against the rocks on which the castle is built reached Dantes' ears more distinctly as they went on.
020.052 "Bad weather!" said one of the porters, "it won't be good to be at sea tonight.
020.053 --Yes, the abbot is in great danger of getting wet," said the other--and they burst out laughing.
020.054 Dantes did not understand the joke very well, but his hair did not stand on end.
020.055 "Well, here we are!" said the first.
020.056 --Advanced, advanced, said the other, you know well that the last one remained on the road, broken on the rocks, and that the governor told us the next day that we were lazy."
020.057 Four or five more steps were taken, still climbing, and then Dantes felt that he was being taken by the head and feet and swung around.
020.058 "One," said the gravediggers.
020.059 --Two.
020.060 --Three!"
020.061 At the same time, Dantes felt himself thrown, indeed, into an enormous void, crossing the air like a wounded bird, falling, falling always with a dread that froze his heart. Although pulled down by something heavy that precipitated his rapid flight, it seemed to him that this fall lasted a century. At last, with a frightful noise, he entered like an arrow into icy water which made him utter a cry, stifled at once by the immersion.
020.062 Dantes had been thrown into the sea, at the bottom of which a ball of thirty-six attached to his feet was dragging him.
020.063 The sea is the cemetery of the castle of If.
021.000 The island of Tiboulen.
021. 001 Dantès dizzy, almost suffocated, had however the presence of mind to hold his breath, and, as his right hand, as we said, prepared as he was for all the chances, held his knife quite open, he quickly fanned the bag, took out the arm, then the head; but then, in spite of his movements to raise the ball, he continued to feel dragged; then he bent over, seeking the cord which bound his legs, and, by a supreme effort, he cut it precisely at the moment when he suffocated; then, giving a vigorous kick, he went up free on the surface of the sea, while the ball dragged in its unknown depths the coarse fabric which had almost become his shroud.
021.002 Dantes took only time to breathe, and dived a second time; because the first precaution which he had to take was to avoid the glances.
021. 003 When he returned for the second time, he was already at least fifty paces from the place of his fall; he saw above his head a black and tempestuous sky, on the surface of which the wind swept a few rapid clouds, sometimes uncovering a small corner of azure enhanced by a star; Before him stretched the dark and roaring plain, whose waves began to boil as with the approach of a storm, while, behind him, blacker than the sea, blacker than the sky, went up, like a threatening phantom, the giant of granite, whose dark point seemed an arm extended to seize its prey again; on the highest rock was a falot illuminating two shadows
021.004 It seemed to him that these two shadows were leaning over the sea with concern; indeed, these strange gravediggers must have heard the cry which he had thrown out while crossing the space. Dantes therefore dived again, and made a fairly long journey between two waters; this maneuver was formerly familiar to him, and usually attracted around him, in the cove of the Pharo, many admirers, who had often proclaimed him the most skilful swimmer in Marseilles.
021.005 When he returned to the surface of the sea, the falot had disappeared.
021.006 It was necessary to be directed: of all the islands which surround the castle of If, Ratonneau and Pomègue are the nearest; but Ratonneau and Pomègue are inhabited; it is thus of the small island of Daume; the safest island was thus that of Tiboulen or Lemaire; the Islands of Tiboulen and Lemaire are with one league of the castle of If.
021.007 Dantes did not resolve less to gain one of these two islands; but how to find these islands in the middle of the night which thickened every moment around him!
021.008 At this moment, he saw shining like a star the lighthouse of Planier. By heading straight for this lighthouse, he left the island of Tiboulen a little to the left; by pressing a little to the left, he should thus meet this island on his way.
021.009 But, we said it, there was one league at least of the castle of If to this island.
021.010 Often, in the prison, Faria repeated to the young man, by seeing him down and lazy:
021.011 "Dantes, do not let yourself go to this softening; you will drown, if you try to run away, and your strength has not been maintained."
021.012 Beneath the heavy and bitter wave this word had come ringing to Dantes' ears; he had been anxious to go up then and split the waves to see if, indeed, he had not lost any of his strength; he saw with joy that his forced inaction had taken nothing away from his power and agility, and felt that he was still master of the element where, as a child, he had played.
021.013 Moreover fear, this fast persecutor, doubled the vigor of Dantes; he listened, leaning on the top of the waves, if no rumor arrived to him. Each time he rose to the end of a wave, his rapid gaze embraced the visible horizon and tried to plunge into the thick darkness; each wave a little higher than the other waves seemed to him a boat in pursuit, and then he redoubled his efforts, which undoubtedly kept him away, but the repetition of which was to wear out his strength quickly.
021.014 He swam however, and already the terrible castle had melted a little in the night vapor: he did not distinguish it but he always felt it.
021.015 An hour passed during which Dantes, exalted by the feeling of freedom that had invaded his whole person, continued to split the waves in the direction he had made for himself.
021.016 "Let us see," he said to himself, "I have been swimming for nearly an hour, but as the wind is against me I must have lost a quarter of my speed; nevertheless, unless I have taken the wrong line, I must not be far from Tiboulen now.... But, if I had been mistaken!"
021.017 A shudder passed through the swimmer's whole body, he tried to plank for a moment to rest; but the sea grew stronger and stronger, and he soon realized that this means of relief, on which he had counted, was impossible.
021.018 "Well," he said, "so be it, I'll go all the way, until my arms tire, until the cramps take over my body, and then I'll sink to the bottom!"
021.019 And he began to swim with the strength and impulse of despair.
021.020 Suddenly it seemed to him that the sky, already so dark, was growing darker still, that a thick, heavy, compact cloud was descending toward him; at the same time he felt a violent pain in his knee: imagination, with its incalculable speed, told him then that it was the shock of a bullet, and that he would immediately hear the explosion of the gunshot; but the explosion did not sound. Dantes stretched out his hand and felt a resistance; he drew his other leg to him and touched the earth; he then saw what the object was that he had taken for a cloud.
021.021 Twenty paces from him rose a mass of strange rocks that one would take for an immense fire petrified at the moment of its most ardent combustion: it was the island of Tiboulen.
021.022 Dantes got up, took a few steps forward, and stretched out, thanking God, on these granite points, which seemed to him at that hour softer than the softest bed had ever seemed to him.
021.023 Then, in spite of the wind, in spite of the storm, in spite of the rain which started to fall, broken of tiredness that it was, it fell asleep of this delicious sleep of the man in which the body becomes numb but whose soul watches with the conscience of an unhoped-for happiness.
021.024 At the end of an hour, Edmond woke up under the roar of an immense thunderclap: the storm was unleashed in space and beat the air with its dazzling flight; from time to time a flash of lightning descended from the sky like a snake of fire, illuminating the waves and clouds which rolled in front of each other like the waves of an immense chaos.
021.025 Dantes, with his glance of sailor, had not been mistaken: he had approached the first of the two islands, which is indeed that of Tiboulen. He knew that it was bare, uncovered and offered no shelter; but when the storm had calmed down he would put to sea again and swim to Lemaire Island, which was just as barren, but wider, and therefore more hospitable.
021.026 A rock which overhung offered a momentary shelter to Dantes, he took refuge there, and almost at the same moment the storm burst in all its fury.
021. 027 Edmond felt the rock under which he was sheltering tremble; the waves, breaking against the base of the gigantic pyramid, gushed up to him; safe as he was, he was in the midst of this deep noise, in the midst of these dazzling glares, taken by a kind of vertigo: It seemed to him that the island was trembling under him, and from one moment to the next was going, like a ship at anchor, to break its cable, and drag him into the middle of the immense whirlpool.
021.028 He then remembered that for twenty-four hours he had not eaten: he was hungry, he was thirsty.
021.029 Dantes stretched out his hands and his head, and drank the water of the storm in the hollow of a rock.
021. 030 As he got up, a lightning which seemed to open the sky to the foot of the dazzling throne of God illuminated the space; In the light of this flash, between Lemaire Island and Cape Croisille, a quarter of a league from him, Dantes saw appear, like a spectre sliding from the top of a wave into an abyss, a small fishing boat carried away by both the storm and the sea; a second later, at the top of another wave, the phantom reappeared, approaching with frightful rapidity. Dantes wanted to shout, and looked for some flap of cloth to wave in the air to show them that they were lost, but they could see it themselves. In the light of another flash of lightning, the young man saw four men clinging to the masts and props; a fifth was standing at the helm of the broken rudder. These men he saw must have seen him too, for desperate cries, carried by the whistling gust, reached his ear. Above the mast, twisted like a reed, a tattered sail was flapping in the air; suddenly the ties that still held it in place broke, and it disappeared, carried into the dark depths of the sky, like those great white birds that are drawn on the black clouds.
021.031 At the same time, a frightening crack was heard, and cries of agony reached Dantes. Clinging like a sphinx to his rock, from which he plunged into the abyss, a new flash of lightning showed him the small broken building, and, among the debris, heads with desperate faces, arms stretched out towards the sky.
021.032 Then all returned in the night, the terrible spectacle had had the duration of the flash.
021.033 Dantes rushed on the slippery slope of the rocks, at the risk of rolling himself into the sea; he looked, he listened, but he heard and saw nothing more: no more cries, no more human efforts; the storm alone, this great thing of God, continued to roar with the winds and to foam with the waves.
021.034 Little by little, the wind died down; the sky rolled towards the west with large gray clouds, so to speak, tainted by the storm; the azure reappeared with the stars more scintillating than ever; soon, towards the east, a long reddish band drew blue-black undulations on the horizon; the waves leaped, a sudden gleam ran over their tops and changed their foamy tops into manes of gold.
021.035 It was the day.
021.036 Dantes remained motionless and mute before this great spectacle, as if he were seeing it for the first time. Indeed, he had forgotten how long he had been in the Chateau d'If. He turned back to the fortress, looking at the land and the sea with a long circular glance.
021.037 The dark building emerged from the heart of the waves with that imposing majesty of immobile things, which seem to watch and command at the same time.
021.038 It could be five o'clock in the morning; the sea continued to calm.
021.039 "In two or three hours," said Edmond to himself, "the key-bearer will enter my room, will find the corpse of my poor friend, will recognize it, will search for me in vain and will give the alarm. Then they will find the hole, the gallery; they will question those men who threw me into the sea and who must have heard the cry that I uttered. Immediately, boats filled with armed soldiers will run after the unfortunate fugitive that one knows well not to be far. The cannon will warn all the coast that it is not necessary to give shelter to a man whom one will meet, naked and starving. The spies and the alguazils of Marseille will be warned and will beat the coast, while the governor of the château d'If will have the sea beaten. Then, hunted on the water, surrounded on the land, what will become of me? I am hungry, I am cold, I have dropped even the knife that saved me from swimming; I am at the mercy of the first peasant who will want to earn twenty francs by handing me over; I have no more strength, no idea, no resolution. O my God! my God! see if I have suffered enough, and if you can do more for me than I can do myself."
021.040 At the moment when Edmond, in a sort of delirium occasioned by the exhaustion of his strength and the emptiness of his brain, pronounced, anxiously turned towards the château d'If, this ardent prayer, he saw appear, at the point of the island of Pomègue, drawing its Latin sail on the horizon, and similar to a seagull which flies by skimming the sea, a small vessel which the eye of a sailor could alone recognize for a Genoese tartane on the still half-dark line of the sea. It came from the port of Marseilles and gained the open sea by pushing the sparkling foam in front of the sharp prow which opened an easier road to its rebounded sides.
021.041 "Oh!" cried Edmond, "to think that in half an hour I would have joined this ship if I did not fear being questioned, recognized as a fugitive, and driven back to Marseilles! What to do? What to say? What fable to invent that they could be fooled by? These people are all smugglers, half-pirates. Under the pretext of coastal navigation, they scour the coasts; they would rather sell me than do a good and sterile deed.
021.042 "Let us wait.
021.043 "But waiting is impossible: I am dying of hunger; in a few hours, the little strength I have left will be gone: besides, the hour of the visit is approaching; the awakening has not yet been given, perhaps nothing will be suspected: I can pass myself off as one of the sailors of the little ship that broke up last night. This fable will not lack verisimilitude; no one will come to contradict me, they are all well swallowed up. Let us go."
021.044 And, while saying these words, Dantes turned his eyes towards the place where the little ship had broken up, and flinched. On the edge of a rock had hung the Phrygian cap of one of the shipwrecked sailors, and close by floated some debris of the hull, inert joists which the sea was pushing and pushing against the base of the island, which they were beating like powerless battering rams.
021.045 In an instant, Dantes' resolution was made; he put himself back into the sea, swam towards the bonnet, covered his head with it, seized one of the joists and headed to cut the line that the ship was to follow.
021.046 "Now I am saved," he murmured.
021.047 And this conviction gave him back his strength.
021.048 Soon he saw the tartan, which, having the wind almost up, was running broadsides between the Château d'If and the Planier tower. For a moment, Dantes feared that instead of hugging the coast the little ship would have gone out to sea, as it would have done, for example, if its destination had been Corsica or Sardinia: but, from the way it maneuvered, the swimmer soon recognized that it wished to pass, as is the habit of ships going to Italy, between the island of Jaros and the island of Calasereigne.
021.049 However, the ship and the swimmer approached each other imperceptibly; in one of its tacks, the small vessel even came within a quarter of a league of Dantes. He then rose on the waves, waving his cap as a sign of distress; but no one saw him on the ship, which turned the edge and began a new tack. Dantes thought of calling; but he measured the distance with his eyes and understood that his voice would not reach the ship, carried away and covered by the sea breeze and the noise of the waves.
021.050 It is then that he was pleased with this precaution which he had taken to lie down on a joist. Weakened as he was, perhaps he would not have been able to support himself on the sea until he had joined the tartane; and, certainly, if the tartane, which was possible, passed without seeing him, he would not have been able to regain the coast.
021.051 Dantes, although he was more or less certain of the route the ship was following, followed it with his eyes with a certain anxiety, until he saw it make its descent and return to him.
021.052 Then he went forward to meet it; but before they had joined, the ship began to turn away.
021.053 Immediately Dantes, with a supreme effort, rose almost to his feet on the water, waving his cap, and uttering one of those lamentable cries which sailors in distress utter, and which seem to be the complaint of some genius of the sea.
021.054 This time, one saw and heard him. The tartan interrupted its maneuver and turned the course on its side. At the same time, he saw that they were preparing to put a rowboat into the sea.
021.055 A moment later, the longboat, mounted by two men, headed in his direction, beating the sea with its double oar. Dantes then let the joist slide, which he thought he no longer needed, and swam vigorously to spare those who were coming to him halfway.
021.056 However, the swimmer had counted on almost absent forces; it was then that he felt of what use had been to him this piece of wood which was already floating, inert, a hundred steps from him. His arms began to stiffen, his legs had lost their flexibility; his movements became hard and jerky, his chest was panting.
021.057 He uttered a loud cry, the two rowers redoubled their energy, and one of them shouted to him in Italian:
021.058 "Courage!"
021.059 The word came to him just as a wave, which he no longer had the strength to overcome, passed over his head and covered him with foam.
021.060 He returned, beating the sea with the unequal and desperate movements of a drowning man, uttered a third cry, and felt himself sinking into the sea as if he still had the mortal ball and chain at his feet.
021.061 The water passed over his head, and through the water he saw the sky livid with black spots.
021.062 A violent effort brought him back to the surface of the sea. Then it seemed to him that he was being grabbed by the hair; then he saw nothing more, heard nothing more; he was faint.
021.063 When he opened his eyes again, Dantes found himself on the deck of the tartan, which was continuing on its way; his first glance was to see in which direction it was going: it was still moving away from the Château d'If.
021.064 Dantes was so exhausted that his exclamation of joy was taken for a sigh of pain.
021.065 As we have said, he was lying on the deck: a sailor was rubbing his limbs with a woolen blanket; another, whom he recognized as the one who had shouted to him: "Courage! Another, whom he recognized as the one who had shouted "Courage!" was putting the mouth of a gourd into his mouth; a third, an old sailor, who was both pilot and skipper, was looking at him with the feeling of selfish pity that men generally feel for a misfortune from which they have escaped the day before and which may befall them the next day.
021.066 A few drops of rum, which the gourd contained, revived the young man's failing heart, while the frictions which the sailor, kneeling before him, continued to operate with wool restored elasticity to his limbs.
021.067 "Who are you?" asked the master in bad French.
021.068 --I am," replied Dantes in bad Italian, "a Maltese sailor; we came from Syracuse, we were loaded with wine and panoline. The squall of this night surprised us at Cape Morgiou, and we were broken against those rocks that you see over there.
021.069 --Where did you come from?
021.070 --From those rocks where I had the good fortune to cling, while our poor captain broke his head. Our three other companions drowned. I think I am the only one left alive; I saw your ship, and, fearing that I would have to wait for a long time on this isolated and deserted island, I ventured on a piece of our ship to try to come to you. Thank you," continued Dantes, "you saved my life; I was lost when one of your sailors seized me by the hair.
021.071 --That's me, said a sailor with a frank and open face, framed by long black sideburns; and it was time, you were sinking.
021.072 --Yes, said Dantes, extending his hand, yes, my friend, and I thank you a second time.
021.073 --My faith!" said the sailor, "I almost hesitated; with your six-inch long beard and your foot-long hair, you looked more like a brigand than an honest man."
021.074 Dantes did indeed remember that since he had been in the Castle of Yew he had not cut his hair, nor had he grown a beard.
021.075 "Yes," he said, "it was a vow I had made to Our Lady of the Pius of the Grotta, in a moment of danger, to be ten years without cutting my hair or my beard. Today is the expiration of my vow, and I almost drowned on my birthday.
021.076 --Now, what are we going to do with you?
021.077 -- Alas! replied Dantes, whatever you like: the felucca I was riding is lost, the captain is dead; as you see, I escaped the same fate, but absolutely naked: fortunately, I am a good enough sailor; throw me into the first port where you land, and I will always find employment on a merchant ship.
021.078 -- You know the Mediterranean?
021.079 -- I have been sailing there since I was a child.
021.080 --You know the good anchorages?
021.081 --There are few ports, even the most difficult ones, that I cannot enter or leave with my eyes closed.
021.082 -- Well, tell me, boss," asked the sailor who had shouted courage to Dantes, "if the comrade is telling the truth, who's stopping him from staying with us?
021.083 --Yes, if he is telling the truth, said the skipper with an air of doubt, but in the state the poor devil is in, one promises a lot, even if it means keeping what one can.
021.084 --I will keep more than I promised, said Dantes.
021.085 --Oh! oh! laughed the boss, we'll see about that.
021.086 -- Whenever you like," said Dantes, rising to his feet. Where are you going?
021.087 -- To Livorno.
021.088 -- Well, then, instead of running into tacks that waste precious time, why don't you simply follow the wind as closely as possible?
021.089 --Because we'd be going straight for the island of Rion.
021.090 --You will pass it at more than twenty fathoms.
021.091 -Take the helm, said the skipper, and let us judge your science."
021.092 The young man went and sat down at the rudder, made sure by a slight pressure that the vessel was obedient; and, seeing that, without being of the first finesse, he did not refuse:
021.093 "To arms and bolts!" he said.
021.094 The four sailors who formed the crew ran to their post, while the boss watched them.
021.095 "Hale!" continued Dantes.
021.096 The sailors obeyed with enough precision.
021.097 "And now, tie up well!"
021.098 This order was carried out like the first two, and the little vessel, instead of continuing to run broadsides, began to advance toward the island of Riton, near which it passed, as Dantes had predicted, leaving it, by starboard, about twenty fathoms away.
021.099 "Bravo!" said the skipper.
021.100 --Bravo!" repeated the sailors.
021.101 And all looked, amazed, at this man whose eyes had regained an intelligence and his body a vigor that one was far from suspecting in him.
021.102 "You see," said Dantes, leaving the helm, "that I may be of some use to you, during the crossing at least. If you do not want me in Livorno, well, you will leave me there; and, out of my first months' pay, I will reimburse you for my food up to that point and for the clothes you will lend me.
021.103 -That's good, that's good, said the boss; we can work something out if you are reasonable.
021.104 -A man is worth a man, said Dantes; what you give to the comrades, you will give to me, and all will be said.
021.105 --That is not fair, said the sailor who had pulled Dantes from the sea, for you know more than we do.
021.106 -What on earth are you meddling with? Is that any of your business, Jacopo?" said the skipper; "Everyone is free to commit himself for the amount that suits him.
021.107 --That's right, said Jacopo; it was a simple observation that I was making.
021.108 -- Well, you'd better lend this good boy, who is naked, a pair of pants and a jacket, if you have any spare.
021.109 -- No, said Jacopo, but I have a shirt and pants.
021.110 --That's all I need, said Dantes; thank you, my friend."
021.111 Jacopo let himself slip down the hatch, and came up a moment later with the two garments, which Dantes put on with unspeakable happiness.
021.112 "Now, do you need anything else?" asked the boss.
021.113 --A piece of bread and a second sip of that excellent rum of which I have already tasted; for it has been a long time since I have taken anything."
021.114 Indeed, it was about forty hours ago. A piece of bread was brought to Dantes, and Jacopo presented him with the flask. "Port helm!" cried the captain, turning back to the helmsman. Dantes glanced to the same side as he brought the gourd to his mouth, but the gourd remained halfway.
021.115 "Well," asked the skipper, "what is going on at the Château d'If?"
021.116 Indeed, a small white cloud, the cloud that had attracted Dantes' attention, had just appeared, crowning the battlements of the southern bastion of the Castle of Yew.
021.117 A second later, the sound of a distant explosion died on board the tartan.
021.118 The sailors raised their heads and looked at each other.
021.119 "What does that mean?" asked the skipper.
021.120 --He will have escaped some prisoner this night, said Dantes, and the alarm gun is fired."
021.121 The skipper glanced at the young man, who, as he said these words, had raised the flask to his mouth; but he saw him savoring the liquor it contained with such calmness and satisfaction, that, if he had had any suspicion at all, it only passed through his mind and died at once.
021.122 "Here is rum that is devilishly strong," said Dantes, wiping with the sleeve of his shirt his forehead streaming with sweat.
021.123 --In any case," murmured the boss, looking at him, "if it's him, so much the better; for I have acquired a proud man there."
021.124 Under the pretext that he was tired, Dantes then asked to sit at the helm. The helmsman, delighted to be relieved of his duties, consulted the skipper with his eyes, who nodded that he could hand over the helm to his new companion.
021.125 Dantes thus placed could remain the eyes fixed on the side of Marseilles.
021.126 "What date of the month are we holding?" asked Dantes to Jacopo, who had come to sit after him, losing sight of the Château d'If.
021.127 -The 28th of February, answered the latter.
021.128 --From what year? asked Dantes again.
021.129 --How, what year! You ask of what year?
021.130 --Yes," continued the young man, "I'm asking you what year.
021.131 --You have forgotten what year it is?
021.132 -- What do you want! I was so frightened last night," laughed Dantes, "that I almost lost my mind; so much so that my memory remained all blurred: I ask you, then, on the 28th of February, what year it is?
021.133 --The year 1829," said Jacopo.
021.134 It was fourteen years to the day that Dantes had been arrested.
021.135 He had entered the Chateau d'If at nineteen, and had left at thirty-three.
021.136 A painful smile passed over his lips; he wondered what had become of Mercedes during this time when she must have believed him dead.
021.137 Then a flash of hatred flashed in his eyes as he thought of those three men to whom he owed such long and cruel captivity.
021.138 And he renewed against Danglars, Fernand and Villefort that oath of implacable vengeance which he had already pronounced in his prison.
021.139 And this oath was no longer a vain threat, for, at that hour, the finest sailing ship in the Mediterranean could certainly not have caught up with the little tartan which was making its way under full sail towards Livorno.
022.000 The smugglers.
022.001 Dantes had not yet spent a day on board, that he had already recognized who he was dealing with. Without ever having been at the school of the abbot Faria, the worthy captain of the _Jeune-Amélie_, that was the name of the Genoese tartan, knew almost all the languages that are spoken around this great lake called the Mediterranean; from Arabic to Provençal; This gave him, by sparing him the interpreters, people always annoying and sometimes indiscreet, great facilities of communication, either with the ships which he met at sea, or with the small boats which he raised along the coasts, or finally with the people without name, without fatherland, without apparent state, as there are always some on the paving stones of the quays which border the sea ports, and which live of these mysterious and hidden resources which it is necessary to believe come to them in direct line of the Providence, since they do not have any means of existence visible to the naked eye: one guesses that Dantes was on board a smuggler's ship.
022.002 Also the owner had received Dantes on board with a certain mistrust: he was very well known by all the customs officers of the coast, and, as it was between these gentlemen and him an exchange of ruses more adroit the one than the other, he had thought at first that Dantes was an emissary of lady gabelle, who employed this ingenious means to penetrate some of the secrets of the trade. But the brilliant way in which Dantes had escaped from the ordeal when he had steered as close as possible had entirely convinced him; then, when he had seen that light smoke floating like a plume above the bastion of the Château d'If, and when he had heard the distant sound of the explosion, he had had for a moment the idea that he had just received on board the one to whom, as with the entrances and exits of the kings, the honors of the cannon were granted; This worried him less, it must be said, than if the newcomer were a customs officer; but this second supposition had soon disappeared like the first at the sight of the perfect tranquillity of his recruit.
022.003 Edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what his boss was without his boss being able to know what he was; on whatever side the old sailor or his comrades attacked him, he held firm and made no confession: giving many details about Naples and Malta, which he knew as well as Marseilles, and maintaining, with a firmness that did credit to his memory, his first narrative. It was therefore the Genoese, subtle as he was, who let himself be fooled by Edmond, in whose favor his gentleness, his nautical experience and above all his most skilful dissimulation spoke.
022.004 And then, perhaps the Genoese was like those people of spirit who never know that which they must know, and who believe only what they have interest to believe.
022.005 It was thus in this reciprocal situation that one arrived at Livorno.
022.006 Edmond had to try a new test there: it was to know if he would recognize himself, since he had not seen himself for fourteen years; he had preserved a rather precise idea of what the young man was, he was going to see what he had become man. In the eyes of his comrades, his wish was fulfilled: twenty times already, he had released in Livorno, he knew a barber in rue Saint-Ferdinand. He went to his house to have his beard and hair cut.
022.007 The barber looked with astonishment at this man with long hair and a thick, black beard, who looked like one of those beautiful heads of Titian. It was not yet fashionable in those days to have such a full beard and hair: today a barber would only be surprised that a man with such great physical advantages would agree to do without.
022.008 The barber of Livorno began to work without observation.
022.009 When the operation was finished, when Edmund felt his chin completely shaved, when his hair was reduced to the ordinary length, he asked for a mirror and looked at himself.
022.010 He was then thirty-three years old, as we have said, and these fourteen years in prison had brought about a great moral change in his figure.
022.011 Dantes had entered the Chateau d'If with the round, laughing, blooming face of the happy young man, to whom the first steps in life were easy, and who counts on the future as on the natural deduction of the past: all that was quite changed.
022. 012 His oval figure had lengthened, his laughing mouth had taken on those firm, arrested lines which indicate resolution; his eyebrows had arched under a single, pensive wrinkle; his eyes had become imbued with a deep sadness, from the depths of which sprang from time to time dark flashes of misanthropy and hatred; His complexion, so long removed from the light of day and the rays of the sun, had taken on that matte color which makes, when their faces are framed in black hair, the aristocratic beauty of the men of the North; this profound knowledge which he had acquired had, moreover, reflected on his whole face a halo of intelligent security; moreover, he had, though naturally of a rather high stature, acquired that stocky vigor of a body always concentrating its forces within itself.
022.013 To the elegance of the nervous and thin forms had succeeded the solidity of the rounded and muscular forms. As for his voice, the prayers, the sobs and the imprecations had changed it, sometimes into a timbre of a strange sweetness, sometimes into a rough and almost hoarse accentuation.
022.014 Moreover, unceasingly in a half-light and in the darkness, its eyes had acquired this singular faculty to distinguish the objects during the night, as do those of the hyena and the wolf.
022.015 Edmond smiled when he saw himself: it was impossible that his best friend, if he had a friend left, would recognize him; he did not even recognize himself.
022. 016 The owner of the _Jeune-Amélie_, who was very anxious to keep a man of Edmond's value among his people, had offered him some advances on his share of future profits, and Edmond had accepted; his first care, on leaving the barber's who had just made this first metamorphosis in him, was therefore to go into a store and buy a complete sailor's garment: this clothing, as one knows, is very simple: it consists of white pants, a striped shirt and a Phrygian cap.
022.017 It was in this costume, bringing back to Jacopo the shirt and pants that he had lent him, that Edmond reappeared before the owner of the _Jeune-Amélie_, to whom he was obliged to repeat his story. The skipper did not want to recognize in this handsome and elegant sailor the man with the thick beard, the hair mixed with seaweed, and the body soaked with sea water, whom he had picked up naked and dying on the deck of his ship.
022.018 Carried away by his good looks, he renewed his proposals of engagement to Dantes; but Dantes, who had his own plans, would only accept them for three months.
022.019 Besides, the crew of the _Jeune-Amélie_ was a very active one, and subject to the orders of a skipper who was accustomed not to waste his time. He had hardly been in Livorno for eight days when the ship's sides were filled with painted muslins, prohibited cottons, English powder, and tobacco on which the management had forgotten to put its stamp. It was a question of getting all this out of Livorno, a free port, and disembarking on the shore of Corsica, from where certain speculators took charge of getting the cargo to France.
022.020 One left; Edmond split again this azure sea, first horizon of his youth, which he had seen so often in the dreams of his prison. He left on his right the Gorgon, on his left the Pianosa, and advanced towards the fatherland of Paoli and Napoleon.
022.021 The next day, as he went up on deck, which he always did at a fairly early hour, the skipper found Dantes leaning against the wall of the ship and looking with a strange expression at a pile of granite rocks that the rising sun was flooding with a pinkish light: it was the island of Monte Cristo.
022.022 The _Jeune-Amélie_ left her about three quarters of a league to starboard and continued on her way to Corsica.
022.023 Dantes thought, while skirting this island with a name so resounding to him, that he would only have to jump into the sea and that in half an hour he would be on this promised land. But what would he do there, without instruments to discover his treasure, without weapons to defend it? Besides, what would the sailors say? What would the boss think? It was necessary to wait.
022.024 Fortunately, Dantes knew how to wait: he had waited fourteen years for his freedom; now that he was free, he could wait six months or a year for wealth.
022.025 Would he not have accepted freedom without wealth if it had been offered to him?
022.026 Moreover this wealth was not all chimerical? Born in the sick brain of poor Father Faria, had it not died with him?
022.027 It is true that this letter of Cardinal Spada was strangely precise.
022.028 And Dantes repeated from one end to the other in his memory this letter, of which he had not forgotten a word.
022.029 Evening came; Edmund saw the island pass through all the shades that twilight brings with it, and become lost to everyone in the darkness; but he, with his eyes accustomed to the darkness of the prison, no doubt continued to see it, for he remained the last on deck.
022.030 The next day, one woke up at the height of Aleria. All day long there were broadsides, and in the evening fires were lit on the coast. By the disposition of these fires it was undoubtedly recognized that it was possible to disembark, because a lantern went up instead of a flag on the horn of the small ship, and they approached within rifle range of the shore.
022.031 Dantes had noticed, for these solemn circumstances no doubt, that the skipper of the _Jeune Amélie_ had mounted on his pivot, as he approached the land, two small couleuvrines, similar to bulwark guns, which, without making much noise, could send a nice four-to-the-pound bullet a thousand paces.
022.032 But, for this evening, the precaution was superfluous; all passed most gently and most politely of the world. Four boats approached the ship with little noise, which, undoubtedly to do them honor, put its own boat overboard; so much so that at two o'clock in the morning all the load had passed from the edge of the _Jeune-Amélie_ on the dry land.
022.033 The same night, since the skipper of the _Jeune Amélie_ was a man of order, the distribution of the bounty was made: each man had a hundred Tuscan pounds of share, that is to say about eighty francs of our currency.
022.034 But the expedition was not finished; one put the course on Sardinia. It was a question of going to reload the building which one had just unloaded.
022.035 The second operation was carried out as well as the first; the _Jeune-Amélie_ was on a lucky streak.
022.036 The new cargo was for the duchy of Lucca. It consisted almost entirely of Havana cigars, sherry and Malaga wine.
022.037 There they had a run-in with the gabelle, that eternal enemy of the owner of the _Jeune-Amélie_. A customs officer was killed and two sailors were wounded. Dantes was one of these two sailors; a bullet had pierced the flesh of his left shoulder.
022.038 Dantes was almost happy with this skirmish and almost happy with this wound; they had taught him, these rough teachers, with what eye he looked at the danger and with what heart he bore the suffering. He had looked at the danger with a laugh, and on receiving the blow he had said, like the Greek philosopher, "Pain, you are not an evil."
022.039 Moreover, he had examined the mortally wounded customs officer, and, whether the heat of the blood in the action or the chill of human feelings, the sight had produced only a slight impression on him. Dantes was on the road he wanted to travel, and was walking to the goal he wanted to reach: his heart was petrifying in his chest.
022.040 Besides, Jacopo, who had thought he was dead when he saw him fall, had rushed to him, picked him up, and finally, once he had been picked up, had looked after him like an excellent comrade.
022.041 So this world was not so good as Dr. Pangloss saw it; but neither was it so bad as Dantes saw it, since this man, who had nothing to expect from his companion but to inherit his share of the bounty, felt so keenly afflicted by seeing him killed?
022.042 Fortunately, as we have said, Edmond was only wounded. Thanks to certain herbs gathered at certain times and sold to the smugglers by old Sardinian women, the wound closed very quickly. Edmond then wanted to tempt Jacopo; he offered him, in exchange for the care he had received, his share of the bounty, but Jacopo refused indignantly.
022.043 The result of this kind of sympathetic devotion that Jacopo had shown to Edmond from the first moment he had seen him was that Edmond granted Jacopo a certain amount of affection. But Jacopo did not ask for more: he had instinctively guessed in Edmond this supreme superiority to his position, a superiority that Edmond had managed to hide from the others. And the brave sailor was happy with the little that Edmond gave him.
022.044 Also, during the long days on board, when the ship running with safety on this azure sea needed, thanks to the favorable wind which inflated its sails, only the help of the helmsman, Edmond, a marine chart in the hand, made himself a teacher with Jacopo, as poor Father Faria had made himself a teacher with him. He showed him the location of the coasts, explained to him the variations of the compass, taught him to read in that great open book above our heads, which is called the sky, and where God has written on the azure with letters of diamond.
022.045 And when Jacopo asked him:
022.046 "What is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me?"
022.047 Edmond would answer:
022.048 "Who knows? you may be a ship's captain one day: your compatriot Bonaparte has indeed become emperor!"
022.049 We forgot to say that Jacopo was Corsican.
022.050 Two and a half months had already passed in these successive races. Edmond had become as skilful a coaster as he had once been a bold sailor; he had become acquainted with all the smugglers of the coast: he had learned all the Masonic signs by means of which these half-pirates recognize each other.
022.051 He had passed his island of Monte Cristo twenty times, but in all this he had not once found the opportunity to land there.
022.052 He had therefore made a resolution:
022.053 It was, as soon as his engagement with the skipper of the _Jeune-Amélie_ had come to an end, to hire a small boat on his own account (Dantes could, for in his various errands he had amassed a hundred piastres), and, under some pretext, to go to the island of Monte Cristo.
022.054 There he would be free to do his research.
022.055 Not in complete freedom, because he would, without a doubt, be spied on by those who had led him.
022.056 But in this world one must risk something.
022.057 Prison had made Edmond cautious, and he would have liked to risk nothing.
022.058 But no matter how much he searched his imagination, no matter how fertile it was, he could find no other way to get to the island he wanted so badly than to have someone drive him there.
022.059 Dantes was floating in this hesitation, when the skipper, who had put great confidence in him, and who had a great desire to keep him in his service, took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern in the via del Oglio, in which the best smugglers of Livorno used to gather.
022.060 It was there that the business of the coast was usually treated. Two or three times already Dantes had entered this maritime exchange; and on seeing these bold skimmers, which a coastline of about two thousand leagues in circumference provides, he had wondered what power a man would not have who could manage to give the impulse of his will to all these united or divergent threads.
022.061 This time, it was a question of a great affair: it was a question of a ship loaded with Turkish carpets, fabrics of the Levant and Cashmere; it was necessary to find a neutral ground where the exchange could be made, then to try to throw these objects on the coasts of France.
022.062 The premium was enormous if one succeeded; it was fifty to sixty piastres per man.
022.063 The skipper of the _Jeune Amélie_ proposed as a landing place the island of Monte Cristo, which, being completely deserted and having neither soldiers nor customs officers, seems to have been placed in the middle of the sea in the time of pagan Olympus by Mercury, that god of merchants and thieves, classes which we have made separate, if not distinct, and which antiquity, as it seems, placed in the same category.
022.064 At this name of Monte Cristo, Dantes flinched with joy: he rose to hide his emotion and took a tour of the smoky tavern where all the idioms of the known world were melting into the Frankish language.
022.065 When he approached the two interlocutors, it was decided that they would release Monte Cristo and that they would leave for this expedition the following night.
022.066 Edmond, consulted, was of the opinion that the island offered all possible security, and that great enterprises to succeed, needed to be carried out quickly.
022.067 Nothing was therefore changed in the program that had been decided. It was agreed that we would sail the next evening, and that we would try, the sea being beautiful and the wind favorable, to be in the waters of the neutral island the following day.
023.000 The island of Monte Cristo.
023.001 At last Dantes, by one of those unhoped-for happinesses which sometimes happen to those on whom the rigor of fate has long wearied, Dantes was going to arrive at his goal by a simple and natural means, and set foot on the island without inspiring any suspicion in anyone.
023.002 Only one night separated him from this long-awaited departure.
023.003 This night was one of the most feverish that Dantes spent. During that night, all the good and bad chances presented themselves in turn to his mind: if he closed his eyes, he saw Cardinal Spada's letter written in flaming characters on the wall; if he fell asleep for a moment, the most insane dreams came swirling into his brain. He descended into the caves with emerald pavements, ruby walls and diamond stalactites. The pearls fell drop by drop as underground water usually filters.
023.004 Edmond, delighted, amazed, filled his pocket with gems; then he returned to the day, and these gems had changed into simple pebbles. Then he tried to return in these marvellous caves, only glimpsed; but the way twisted in infinite spirals: the entry had become invisible again. He searched uselessly in his tired memory for that magic and mysterious word which opened for the Arab fisherman the splendid caves of Ali-Baba. All was useless; the disappeared treasure had again become the property of the geniuses of the earth, from whom he had had a moment's hope of taking it.
023.005 The day came almost as feverishly as the night had been; but it brought logic to bear on the imagination, and Dantes was able to arrest a plan that had hitherto been vague and floating in his brain.
023.006 The evening came, and with the evening the preparations for departure. These preparations were a means for Dantes to hide his agitation. Little by little, he had taken that authority over his companions, to command as if he were the master of the ship; and as his orders were always clear, precise and easy to carry out, his companions obeyed him not only promptly, but also with pleasure.
023.007 The old sailor let him do this: he too had recognized the superiority of Dantes over his other sailors and over himself. He saw in the young man his natural successor, and he regretted that he did not have a daughter to chain Edmund to this high alliance.
023.008 At seven o'clock in the evening everything was ready; at ten minutes past seven they passed the lighthouse, just as the light was coming on.
023.009 The sea was calm, with a fresh wind coming from the southeast; one sailed under a sky of azure, where God also lit in turn his lighthouses, each of which is a world. Dantes declared that everyone could lie down and that he would take over the helm.
023.010 When the Maltese (as Dantes was called) had made such a declaration, that was enough, and everyone went to bed in peace.
023.011 That happened sometimes: Dantes, rejected from the solitude in the world, felt from time to time an imperious need for solitude. Now, what solitude could be more immense and more poetic than that of a ship floating alone on the sea, during the darkness of the night, in the silence of the immensity and under the gaze of the Lord?
023.012 This time, the solitude was populated by his thoughts, the night illuminated by his illusions, the silence animated by his promises.
023.013 When the master woke up, the ship was under full sail: there was not a shred of canvas that was not swollen by the wind; we were making more than two and a half leagues an hour.
023.014 The island of Monte Cristo grew on the horizon.
023.015 Edmond returned the ship to his master and went to lie down in his hammock: but, in spite of his sleepless night, he could not sleep a wink.
023.016 Two hours later, he went up on the bridge; the building was doubling the island of Elba. One was at the height of Mareciana and above the flat and green island of Pianosa. One saw the flaming top of Monte Cristo rising into the azure of the sky.
023.017 Dantes ordered the helmsman to put the helm to port, in order to leave the Pianosa to the right; he had calculated that this maneuver should shorten the route by two or three knots.
023.018 Towards five o'clock in the evening, one had the complete sight of the island. The smallest details were visible, thanks to that atmospheric limpidity which is peculiar to the light poured out by the sun's rays at its decline.
023.019 Edmond devoured with the eyes this mass of rocks which passed by all the twilight colors, since the sharp pink until the dark blue; from time to time, ardent puffs went up to the face to him; his forehead empourpait, a purple cloud passed in front of his eyes.
023.020 Never a player whose whole fortune is at stake had, on a throw of the dice, the anguish that Edmond felt in his paroxysms of hope.
023.021 The night came: at ten o'clock in the evening they boarded; the _Jeune-Amélie_ was the first to arrive.
023.022 Dantes, in spite of his ordinary empire over himself, could not contain himself: he jumped first on the shore; if he had dared like Brutus, he would have kissed the ground.
023.023 It was nighttime; but at eleven o'clock the moon rose from the middle of the sea, silvery with every quiver; then its rays, as it rose, began to play, in white cascades of light, on the piled up rocks of this other Pelion.
023.024 The island was familiar to the crew of the _Jeune Amélie_: it was one of their ordinary stations. As for Dantes, he had recognized it on each of his voyages to the Levant, but he had never been down there.
023.025 He questioned Jacopo.
023.026 "Where shall we spend the night?" he asked.
023.027 --But on board the tartan, answered the sailor.
023.028 --Wouldn't we be better off in the caves?
023.029 --In what caves?
023.030 --But in the caves of the island.
023.031 --I don't know any caves," said Jacopo.
023.032 A cold sweat passed over Dantes' forehead.
023.033 "There are no caves in Monte Cristo?" he asked.
023.034 --No."
023.035 Dantes remained a moment dazed; then he thought that these caves might have been filled in since by some accident, or even plugged up, for greater precautions, by Cardinal Spada. The main thing, in this case, was to find this lost opening. It was useless to look for it during the night. Dantes therefore postponed the investigation until the following day. Moreover, a signal flown half a league out to sea, to which the _Jeune Amélie_ immediately replied with a similar signal, indicated that the time had come to set to work. The late vessel, reassured by the signal which should have made known to the last to arrive that there was every safety to be had, soon appeared white and silent as a ghost, and came to cast anchor a cable from the shore.
023.036 Immediately the transport began.
023.037 Dantes thought, while working, of the hurrah of joy that with a single word he could provoke among all those men if he said aloud the incessant thought that was buzzing low in his ear and heart. But, quite to the contrary of revealing the magnificent secret, he feared to have already said too much and to have, by his comings and goings, his repeated requests, his minute observations and his continual preoccupation, aroused suspicions. Fortunately, for this circumstance at least, a very painful past reflected on his face an indelible sadness, and the glimmers of gaiety seen under this cloud were really only flashes.
023.038 No one suspected anything, and when the next day, taking a rifle, lead and powder, Dantes manifested the desire to go and kill one of those numerous wild goats that one saw jumping from rock to rock, one attributed this excursion of Dantes only to the love of hunting or to the desire for solitude. It was only Jacopo who insisted on following him. Dantes did not want to oppose it, fearing by this reluctance to be accompanied to inspire some suspicions. But hardly had he gone a quarter of a league, that having found the occasion to shoot and kill a kid, he sent Jacopo to carry it to his companions, inviting them to cook it and to give him, when it was cooked, the signal to eat his share of it by firing a gun; some dried fruits and a fiasco of wine of Monte-Pulciano were to complete the order of the meal.
023.039 Dantes continued his way while turning over from time to time. Arrived at the top of a rock, he saw at one thousand feet below him his companions whom Jacopo had just joined and who were already actively occupied with the preparations of the lunch, increased, thanks to the address of Edmond, of a capital piece.
023.040 Edmond looked at them for a moment with the gentle, sad smile of a superior man.
023.041 "In two hours," he said, "these people will leave, rich with fifty piastres, to go, risking their lives, to try to win fifty more; then they will return, rich with six hundred pounds, to squander this treasure in some city, with the pride of sultans and the confidence of nabobs. Today, hope makes me despise their wealth, which seems to me the deepest misery; tomorrow, disappointment will perhaps make me be forced to look upon this deep misery as the supreme happiness.... Oh, no," cried Edmund, "that will not be; the learned, the infallible Faria would not have been mistaken in this one thing. Besides, it would be better to die than to continue to lead this miserable and inferior life."
023.042 Thus Dantes, who three months ago aspired only to liberty, had already had enough of liberty and aspired to wealth; the fault was not with Dantes, but with God, who, by limiting man's power, made him have infinite desires! However, by a road lost between two walls of rock, following a path dug by the torrent and which, in all probability, no human foot had ever trodden, Dantes had approached the place where he supposed the caves must have existed. While following the shore of the sea and examining the smallest objects with serious attention, he thought he noticed on certain rocks notches dug by the hand of man.
023.043 Time, which throws over all physical things its mantle of moss, as over moral things its mantle of oblivion, seemed to have respected these signs traced with a certain regularity, and with the aim probably of indicating a trace; from time to time, however, these signs disappeared under clumps of myrtle, which bloomed in large bouquets loaded with flowers, or under parasitic lichens. It was then necessary for Edmond to spread the branches or to lift the mosses to find the signs that led him into this other labyrinth. These signs had, moreover, given Edmond good hope. Why shouldn't the cardinal have drawn them so that they could serve as a guide for his nephew in the event of a catastrophe that he had not been able to foresee so completely? This solitary place was well suited to a man who wanted to bury a treasure. Only, had these unfaithful signs not attracted other eyes than those for whom they were traced, and had the island of dark wonders faithfully kept its magnificent secret?
023.044 However, at about sixty paces from the port, it seemed to Edmond, always hidden from his companions by the accidents of the ground, that the cuts stopped; only they did not lead to any cave. A large round rock placed on a solid base was the only goal to which they seemed to lead. Edmond thought that instead of having arrived at the end, he was perhaps, on the contrary, only at the beginning; he therefore took the opposite course and returned on his steps.
023.045 Meanwhile, his companions prepared lunch, fetched water from a spring, carried bread and fruit to the ground, and cooked the kid. Just as they were pulling it from its improvised spit, they saw Edmond, light and bold as a chamois, jumping from rock to rock: they fired a shotgun to give him the signal. The hunter immediately changed direction, and came running back to them. But at the moment when all followed him with their eyes in the sort of flight he was executing, taxing his skill with temerity, as if to give reason to their fears, Edmond's foot failed him; he was seen to stagger to the top of a rock, to utter a cry and disappear.
023.046 All jumped up with one accord, for they all loved Edmund, in spite of his superiority; however, it was Jacopo who arrived first.
023.047 He found Edmund lying bloody and almost unconscious: he must have rolled from a height of twelve or fifteen feet. A few drops of rum were introduced into his mouth, and this remedy, which had already been so effective on him, produced the same effect as the first time.
023.048 Edmond reopened his eyes, complained of a sharp pain in his knee, a great heaviness in his head, and unbearable twinges in his kidneys. They wanted to carry him to the shore; but when they touched him, although it was Jacopo who directed the operation, he declared with a groan that he did not feel strong enough to bear the transport.
023.049 It is understandable that there was no question of lunch for Dantes; but he demanded that his comrades, who did not have the same reasons as him for going on a diet, return to their posts. As for himself, he claimed that he only needed a little rest, and that on their return they would find him relieved.
023.050 The sailors were not too eager: the sailors were hungry, the smell of goat meat reached them, and one is not ceremonious between sea wolves.
023.051 An hour later, they returned. All Edmund could do was to drag himself for a space of about ten steps to lean against a mossy rock.
023.052 But, far from calming down, Dantes' pains had seemed to grow in violence. The old boss, who was forced to leave in the morning to go to deposit his load on the borders of Piedmont and France, between Nice and Fréjus, insisted that Dantes try to get up. Dantes made superhuman efforts to comply with this invitation, but with each effort he fell back plaintive and pale.
023.053 "He has broken his back," said the skipper, "but he is a good companion, and we must not abandon him; let us try to carry him to the tartan.
023.054 But Dantes declared that he would rather die where he was than endure the excruciating pain that the movement would cause him, weak as he was.
023.055 "Well," said the boss, "come what may, but it will not be said that we have left a brave companion like you without help. We will not leave until this evening."
023.056 This proposal astonished the sailors greatly, though none of them fought it, on the contrary. The skipper was such a rigid man, that it was the first time he had been seen to give up an enterprise, or even to delay its execution.
023.057 Dantes did not want to allow such a serious breach of the rules of discipline on board to be made in his favor.
023.058 "No," he said to the skipper, "I have been a blunderer, and it is right that I should bear the penalty for my blunder. Leave me a small supply of cookies, a rifle, powder and bullets to kill goats, or even to defend myself, and a pickaxe to build me, if you were too slow in coming to take me, a sort of house.
023.059 --But you will starve, said the boss.
023.060 --I like that better, replied Edmond, than to suffer the unheard-of pains that a single movement makes me endure."
023.061 The skipper turned to the side of the ship, which was rocking with a start in the little harbor, ready to put to sea again as soon as her toilet was completed.
023.062 "What do you want us to do, Maltese," he said, "we cannot leave you like this, and we cannot stay, however?
023.063 --Partez, partez!" cried Dantes.
023.064 -- We will be gone for at least eight days, said the boss, and we will have to turn aside from our route to come and take you.
023.065 --Listen, said Dantes: if in two or three days you meet some fishing vessel or other that comes to these parts, recommend me to him, I will give twenty-five piastres for my return to Livorno. If you don't find one, come back."
023.066 The boss shook his head.
023.067 "Listen, boss Baldi, there is a way to reconcile everything," said Jacopo; "go away; I will stay with the wounded man to look after him.
023.068 --And you will give up your share of the money, said Edmund, to stay with me?
023.069 -- Yes, said Jacopo, and without regret.
023.070 --Come on, you are a good boy, Jacopo, said Edmund, God will reward you for your good will; but I don't need anyone, thank you: a day or two of rest will make me well, and I hope to find in these rocks some excellent herbs against bruises."
023.071 And a strange smile passed over the lips of Dantes; he shook hands with Jacopo effusively, but he remained unshaken in his resolution to stay, and to stay alone.
023.072 The smugglers left Edmund with what he asked for, and walked away, not without turning around several times, giving him every sign of a cordial farewell, to which Edmund answered with his hand only, as if he could not move the rest of his body.
023.073 Then, when they had disappeared:
023.074 "It is strange," murmured Dantes, laughing, "that it should be among such men as these that one finds proofs of friendship and acts of devotion."
023.075 Then he carefully dragged himself to the top of a rock that hid the sight of the sea from him, and from there he saw the tartan complete its sail, raise the anchor, swing gracefully like a seagull about to take flight, and depart.
023.076 After an hour, she had completely disappeared: at least, from the place where the wounded man had remained, it was impossible to see her.
023.077 Then Dantes got up, more supple and lighter than one of the goats that leaped among the myrtles and lentisks on those wild rocks, took his rifle in one hand, his pickaxe in the other, and ran to that rock to which the notches he had noticed on the rocks led.
023.078 "And now," he cried, remembering that story of the Arab fisherman that Faria had told him, "now, Sesame, open up!"
024.000 Dazzle.
024. 001 The sun had arrived at about the third of its course, and its May rays gave, warm and lively, on these rocks, which themselves seemed sensitive to its heat; thousands of cicadas, invisible in the heather, made their monotonous and continuous murmur heard; the leaves of the myrtles and olive trees shivered, and made an almost metallic noise; with each step that Edmond made on the heated granite, he made lizards flee which seemed emeralds; one saw leaping, on the inclined slopes, the wild goats which sometimes attract the hunters there In a word, the island was inhabited, alive, animated, and yet Edmond felt alone there under the hand of God.
024.002 He felt some emotion rather like fear: it was that suspicion of the great day, which makes one suppose, even in the desert, that inquisitive eyes are open upon us.
024.003 This feeling was so strong, that at the moment of setting out to work, Edmond stopped, put down his pickaxe, took up his rifle, climbed one last time the highest rock of the island, and from there threw a vast glance on all that surrounded him.
024. 004 But, we must say it, what attracted his attention, it was not this poetic Corsica of which he could distinguish until the houses, nor this almost unknown Sardinia which follows him, nor the island of Elba with the gigantic memories, nor finally this imperceptible line which extended to the horizon and which with the trained eye of the sailor revealed Gênes the superb and Livourne the commercial one; no: it was the brigantine which had left at the point of the day, and the tartane which had just left. The first was on the point of disappearing in the strait of Bonifacio; the other, following the opposite road, skirted Corsica, which it was preparing to pass.
024.005 This sight reassured Edmond.
024.006 He then brought his eyes back to the objects that surrounded him more immediately; he saw himself on the highest point of the island, conical, a small statue of this immense pedestal; below him, not a man; around him, not a boat: nothing but the azure sea that came to beat the base of the island, and that this eternal shock bordered with a silver fringe.
024.007 Then he descended of a fast walk, but however full of prudence: he feared, in such a moment, an accident similar to that which he had so skilfully and so happily simulated.
024.008 Dantes, as we have said, had taken the opposite line of the notches left on the rocks and he had seen that this line led to a kind of small cove hidden like an ancient nymph bath; this cove was wide enough at its opening and deep enough in its center that a small vessel of the kind of the spéronares could enter and remain hidden there. Then, following the thread of inductions, that thread which in the hands of Abbot Faria he had seen guide the mind so ingeniously through the maze of probabilities, he thought that Cardinal Spada, in his interest in not being seen, had approached that cove, had hidden his little vessel there, had followed the line indicated by notches, and had, at the end of that line, buried his treasure.
024.009 It was this supposition that had brought Dantes near the circular rock.
024.010 Only, this thing worried Edmund and upset all the ideas that he had in dynamics: how had one been able, without using considerable forces, to raise this rock, which weighed perhaps five or six thousand, on the kind of base where it rested?
024.011 Suddenly an idea came to Dantes.
024.012 "Instead of making it go up," he said to himself, "we will have made it go down."
024.013 And he himself sprang above the rock, in order to seek the place of its original base.
024. 014 Indeed, soon he saw that a slight slope had been made; the rock had slipped on its base and had come to rest there; another rock, as large as an ordinary stone, had served as a wedge; stones and pebbles had been carefully adjusted to remove any solution of continuity; this kind of small work in masonry had been covered with vegetable ground, grass had pushed there, the moss had spread there, some seeds of myrtle and lentisks had stopped there, and the old rock seemed welded to the ground.
024.015 Dantes carefully removed the earth, and recognized or thought he recognized all this ingenious artifice.
024.016 Then he began to attack with his pickaxe this intermediate wall cemented by time.
024.017 After a work of ten minutes, the wall gave way, and a hole to put the arm in was opened.
024.018 Dantes went to cut the strongest olive tree he could find, stripped it of its branches, inserted it in the hole and made a lever of it.
024.019 But the rock was both too heavy and too firmly wedged by the lower rock for any human force, even that of Hercules himself, to shake it.
024.020 Dantes then thought that it was this hold itself that it was necessary to attack.
024.021 But by what means?
024.022 Dantes cast his eyes around him, as embarrassed men do; and his gaze fell on a mouflon horn full of powder that his friend Jacopo had left him.
024.023 He smiled: the infernal invention was about to do its work.
024.024 With the help of his pickaxe Dantes dug, between the upper rock and the one on which it was placed, a mine duct as pioneers are wont to do, when they want to spare the man's arm too much fatigue, then he stuffed it with gunpowder; then, fraying his handkerchief and rolling it in the saltpeter, he made a wick of it.
024.025 The fire put to this wick, Dantes moved away.
024.026 The explosion was not made to wait: the higher rock was in one instant raised by the incalculable force, the lower rock flew in splinters; by the small opening that had initially made Dantes, escaped a whole world of quivering insects, and an enormous snake, guard of this mysterious way, rolled on its bluish volutes and disappeared.
024.027 Dantes approached: the higher rock, henceforth without support, inclined towards the abyss; the intrepid researcher made the turn of it, chose the most vacillating place, leaned his lever in one of its edges and, similar to Sisyphus, stiffened himself of all his power against the rock.
024.028 The rock, already shaken by the concussion, staggered; Dantes redoubled his efforts: he looked like one of those Titans who uprooted mountains to wage war against the master of the gods. At last the rock gave way, rolled, leaped, and disappeared, sinking into the sea.
024.029 It left discovered a circular place, and brought to light an iron ring sealed in the middle of a square slab.
024.030 Dantes uttered a cry of joy and astonishment: never had a more magnificent result crowned a first attempt.
024.031 He wanted to continue; but his legs trembled so much, but his heart beat so violently, but a cloud so burning passed before his eyes, that he was forced to stop.
024.032 This moment of hesitation had the duration of lightning. Edmond passed his lever in the ring, raised vigorously, and the unsealed slab opened, discovering the fast slope of a kind of staircase which was going to sink in the shade of a cave more and more obscure.
024.033 Another would have rushed up, would have uttered exclamations of joy; Dantes stopped, turned pale, doubted.
024.034 "Let's see," he said to himself, "let's be men! accustomed to adversity, let's not let ourselves be brought down by a disappointment; or else it would be for nothing that I would have suffered! The heart breaks, when after having been dilated beyond measure by the hope with the tepid breath it returns and closes itself in the cold reality! Faria had a dream: Cardinal Spada buried nothing in that cave, perhaps he never even came there, or, if he did, Caesar Borgia the intrepid adventurer, the tireless and dark thief, came there after him, discovered his trail, followed the same broken ground as I did, as I did lifted that stone, and, descending before me, left me nothing to take after him."
024.035 He remained for a moment motionless, thoughtful, his eyes fixed on that dark and continuous opening.
024.036 "Now, now that I am not counting on anything, now that I have told myself that it would be foolish to hold out any hope, the continuation of this adventure is for me a thing of curiosity, that is all."
024.037 And he remained still and meditating.
024. 038 "Yes, yes, this is an adventure to find its place in the mingled life of shadow and light of this royal bandit, in that web of strange events which compose the diaprous weft of his existence; this fabulous event must have chained itself invincibly to the other things; Yes, Borgia came some night here, a torch in one hand, a sword in the other, while twenty paces away from him, at the foot of this rock perhaps, stood, dark and threatening, two henchmen interrogating the earth, the air, and the sea, while their master entered as I shall, shaking the darkness with his fearsome and flaming arm.
024.039 "Yes; but of the henchmen to whom he will have thus delivered his secret, what will Caesar have made of them?" asked Dantes.
024.040 "What was done," he replied, smiling, "with the buriers of Alaric, whom they buried with the buried.
024.041 "However, if he had come there," said Dantes, "he would have found and taken the treasure; Borgia, the man who compared Italy to an artichoke and who ate it leaf by leaf, Borgia knew the use of time too well to have lost his in putting that rock back on its base.
024.042 "Let's go down."
024.043 Then he descended, the smile of doubt on his lips, muttering that last word of human wisdom: Perhaps!
024. 044 But instead of the darkness he had expected to find, instead of an opaque and vitiated atmosphere, Dantes saw only a soft glow broken down into bluish day; The air and the light filtered not only by the opening which had just been made, but also by cracks in the rocks invisible from the ground outside, and through which one saw the azure of the sky where the trembling branches of the holm oaks and the thorny and creeping ligaments of the brambles played.
024.045 After a few seconds of stay in this cave, whose atmosphere rather tepid than wet, rather odorous than insipid, was to the temperature of the island what the blue glow was to the sun, the glance of Dantes, accustomed, as we said, to the darkness, was able to fathom the most remote angles of the cavern: it was of granite whose spangled facets sparkled like diamonds.
024.046 "Alas!" said Edmund to himself, smiling, "here are doubtless all the treasures the cardinal will have left; and this good abbot, seeing in his dreams these walls all resplendent, will have entertained himself in his rich hopes." But Dantès remembered the terms of the will, which he knew by heart: "In the farthest corner of the second opening," said this will.
024.047 Dantes had penetrated only into the first cave; now he had to look for the entrance to the second.
024.048 Dantes oriented himself: this second cave was naturally to sink into the interior of the island; he examined the stumps of the stones, and he went to knock at one of the walls which seemed to him that where this opening was to be, masked undoubtedly for greater precaution.
024.049 The pickaxe resounded for a moment, drawing from the rock a dull sound, whose compactness made Dantes sweat; finally it seemed to the persevering miner that a portion of the granite wall answered by a duller and deeper echo to the call which was made to him; he brought his ardent glance closer to the wall and recognized, with the tact of the prisoner, what no one else would have recognized perhaps: it is that there must be an opening there.
024.050 However, not to make a useless work, Dantes, who, like Caesar Borgia, had studied the price of time, probed the other walls with his pickaxe, questioned the ground with the butt of his rifle, opened the sand in the suspect places, and having found nothing recognized, returned to the portion of the wall which gave this consoling sound.
024.051 He struck again and with greater force.
024.052 Then he saw a singular thing, that under the blows of the instrument a kind of plaster, similar to that which one applies to the walls to paint in fresco, was raised and fell in scales revealing a whitish and soft stone, similar to our ordinary stones of size. One had closed the opening of the rock with stones of another nature, then one had spread on these stones this coating, then on this coating one had imitated the tint and the crystalline of the granite.
024.053 Dantes then struck by the sharp end of the pickaxe, which entered an inch into the wall holder.
024.054 It was there that it was necessary to excavate.
024. 055 By a strange mystery of human organization, the more the proofs that Faria had not been mistaken should, by accumulating, reassure Dantes, the more his failing heart gave way to doubt and almost to discouragement: this new experience, which should have given him new strength, took away the strength that remained to him: the pickaxe went down, almost escaping from his hands; he put it on the ground, wiped his forehead and went up towards the day, giving himself the pretext to see if nobody spied on him, but, in reality, because he needed air, because he felt that he was going to faint.
024.056 The island was deserted, and the sun at its zenith seemed to cover it with its eye of fire; in the distance, small fishermen's boats opened their wings on the sapphire blue sea.
024.057 Dantes had not yet taken anything: but it was a long time to eat at such a moment; he swallowed a mouthful of rum and returned to the cave with a strengthened heart.
024.058 The pickaxe that had seemed so heavy had become light again; he lifted it as he would a feather, and vigorously set to work again.
024.059 After a few strokes he saw that the stones were not sealed, but only laid one on top of the other and covered with the plaster we have spoken of; he inserted the point of the pickaxe into one of the cracks, weighed down the handle, and saw with joy the stone fall at his feet.
024.060 From then on, Dantes had only to pull each stone to himself with the iron tooth of the pickaxe, and each stone in turn fell near the first.
024.061 From the first opening, Dantes could have entered; but to delay for a few moments was to delay certainty by clinging to hope.
024.062 Finally, after a new hesitation of a moment, Dantes passed from this first cave into the second.
024.063 This second cave was lower, darker and more frightening than the first; the air, which only penetrated through the opening just made, had that mephitic odor that Dantes had been surprised not to find in the first.
024.064 Dantes gave the outside air time to revive this dead atmosphere, and entered.
024.065 To the left of the opening was a deep, dark corner.
024.066 But, as we have said, for Dantes' eye there was no darkness.
024.067 He probed the second cave with his eyes: it was empty like the first.
024.068 The treasure, if it existed, was buried in that dark corner.
024.069 The hour of anguish had arrived; two feet of earth to search was all that remained to Dantes between supreme joy and supreme despair.
024.070 He advanced toward the corner, and, as if seized by a sudden resolution, he attacked the ground boldly.
024.071 At the fifth or sixth blow of the pickaxe, the iron sounded on iron.
024.072 No funeral tocsin, no shuddering knell ever had such an effect on the one who heard it. Dantes would not have encountered anything that would not have made him pale.
024.073 He probed next to the place where he had already probed, and encountered the same resistance but not the same sound.
024.074 "It is a wooden box, banded with iron," he said.
024.075 At that moment a swift shadow passed intercepting the day.
024.076 Dantes dropped his pickaxe, grabbed his rifle, passed through the opening again, and dashed toward the day.
024.077 A wild goat had leaped over the first entrance to the cave and was grazing a few feet away.
024.078 It was a good opportunity to secure his dinner, but Dantes was afraid that the sound of the gun would attract someone.
024.079 He thought for a moment, cut down a resinous tree, went to light it at the still smoldering fire where the smugglers had cooked their lunch, and returned with the torch.
024.080 He did not want to lose any details of what he was about to see.
024.081 He brought the torch close to the shapeless, unfinished hole, and recognized that he had not been mistaken: his blows had struck alternately on the iron and on the wood.
024.082 He planted his torch in the ground and set to work.
024.083 In an instant, a site about three feet long and two feet wide was cleared, and Dantes could recognize a chest of oak wood ringed with chased iron. In the middle of the lid shone, on a silver plate that the earth had not been able to tarnish, the arms of the Spada family, that is to say a sword posed in pale on an oval escutcheon, as are the Italian escutcheons, and surmounted by a hat of cardinal.
024.084 Dantes recognized them easily: Abbot Faria had drawn them for him so many times!
024.085 From then on, there was no longer any doubt that the treasure was there; they would not have taken so many precautions to put an empty chest back in its place.
024.086 In an instant, all the surroundings of the chest were cleared, and Dantes saw in turn the middle lock, placed between two padlocks, and the handles of the side faces appear; all this was chiseled as one chiseled at that time, when art made the vilest metals precious.
024.087 Dantes took the chest by the handles and tried to lift it: it was impossible.
024.088 Dantes tried to open it: lock and padlock were closed; the faithful guardians seemed not to want to return their treasure.
024.089 Dantes inserted the sharp side of his pickaxe between the chest and the lid, pressed the handle of the pickaxe, and the lid, after shouting, burst. A wide opening of the ais rendered the fittings useless, they fell in their turn, still clutching with their tenacious nails the planks notched by their fall, and the chest was uncovered.
024.090 A dizzying fever seized Dantes; he seized his rifle, cocked it, and placed it near him. First he closed his eyes, as children do, to see, in the sparkling night of their imagination, more stars than they can count in a still-lit sky, then he opened them again and remained dazzled.
024.091 Three compartments divided the chest.
024.092 In the first shone gleaming gold shields with tawny reflections.
024.093 In the second, badly polished ingots arranged in good order, but which had of gold only the weight and the value.
024.094 In the third finally, with half full, Edmond moved with handle diamonds, pearls, rubies, which, cascade sparkling, made, while falling the ones on the others, the noise of the hail on the panes.
024.095 After having touched, palpated, sunk his quivering hands in the gold and the gems, Edmond got up and took his race through the caves with the trembling exaltation of a man who touches the madness. He jumped on a rock from which he could see the sea, and saw nothing; he was alone, quite alone, with these incalculable, unheard-of, fabulous riches which belonged to him: only was he dreaming or was he awake? was he dreaming a fleeting dream or was he embracing a reality?
024.096 He needed to see his gold again, and however he felt that he would not have the strength, at this moment, to support the sight of it. For a moment, he leaned his two hands on the top of his head, as if to prevent his reason from running away; then he dashed across the island, without following, not a path, there is none in the island of Monte Cristo, but a fixed line, making the wild goats flee and frightening the sea birds by his cries and gesticulations. Then, by a detour, he returned, doubting again, rushing from the first cave into the second, and finding himself in front of this gold and diamond mine.
024.097 This time he fell to his knees, compressing his leaping heart with his two convulsive hands, and murmuring a prayer intelligible to God alone.
024.098 Soon he felt calmer and therefore happier, for from that hour alone he began to believe in his bliss.
024. 099 He then began to count his fortune; there were one thousand gold bars of two to three pounds each; then he piled up twenty-five thousand gold shields, each worth eighty francs of our present money, all with the effigy of Pope Alexander VI and his predecessors, and he found that the compartment was only half empty; Finally, he measured ten times the capacity of his two hands in pearls, in gems, in diamonds, many of which, mounted by the best goldsmiths of the time, offered a remarkable value of execution, even beside their intrinsic value.
024.100 Dantes saw the day going down and extinguished little by little. He feared to be surprised if he remained in the cave, and went out with his rifle in his hand. A piece of cookie and a few sips of wine were his supper. Then he replaced the stone, lay down on it, and slept for a few hours, covering the entrance to the cave with his body.
024.101 This night was at the same time one of these delicious and terrible nights, as this man with the lightning emotions had already passed two or three in the life.
025.000 The unknown.
025.001 The day came. Dantes had been waiting for it for a long time, his eyes open. At its first rays, he got up, climbed, as the day before, on the highest rock of the island, in order to explore the surroundings; as the day before, everything was deserted.
025. 002 Edmond went down, lifted the stone, filled his pockets with stones, replaced as best he could the boards and fittings of the chest, covered it with earth, trampled on this earth, threw sand on it, in order to make the freshly turned place similar to the rest of the ground; went out of the cave, replaced the slab, heaped stones of different sizes on the slab; introduced earth in the intervals, planted in these intervals myrtles and heathers, watered the new plantations so that they seemed old; erased the traces of its steps amassed around this place, and awaited with impatience the return of its companions. Indeed, it was no longer a question of spending his time looking at this gold and these diamonds and staying at Monte Cristo like a dragon watching over useless treasures. Now it was necessary to return to life, among men, and to take in society the rank, the influence and the power that wealth, the first and greatest of the forces that the human creature can have, gives in this world.
025.003 The smugglers returned on the sixth day. Dantes recognized from afar the port and the march of the _Jeune-Amelie_; he dragged himself to the port like a wounded Philoctetes, and when his companions boarded, he announced to them, while still complaining, a sensible improvement; then in his turn he listened to the account of the adventurers. They had succeeded, it is true; but hardly had the cargo been deposited, when they had received notice that a brig on guard at Toulon had just left the harbor and was heading their way. They had then fled in a hurry, regretting that Dantes, who knew how to give such superior speed to the ship, was not there to direct it. Indeed, soon they had seen the hunting ship; but with the help of the night, and by doubling the Cape Corsica, they had escaped him.
025.004 All in all, the voyage had not been bad; and all, especially Jacopo, regretted that Dantes had not been on it, in order to have his share of the profits he had brought back, which amounted to fifty piastres.
025.005 Edmund remained inscrutable; he did not even smile at the enumeration of the advantages he would have shared if he had left the island; and, as the _Jeune Amélie_ had only come to Monte Cristo to look for him, he reembarked that same evening and followed the master to Livorno.
025.006 In Livorno he went to a Jew and sold four of his smallest diamonds for five thousand francs each. The Jew could have asked how a sailor came to possess such objects; but he did not, because he earned a thousand francs on each one.
025.007 The next day he bought a brand new boat which he gave to Jacopo, adding to this gift one hundred piastres so that he could hire a crew; and this on condition that Jacopo would go to Marseilles to ask for news of an old man named Louis Dantes who lived in the Allées de Meilhan, and of a young girl who lived in the village of the Catalans and who was called Mercédès.
025.008 It was Jacopo who believed that he was dreaming: Edmund then told him that he had become a sailor on a whim, and because his family refused him the money necessary for his maintenance; but that on arriving in Livorno he had received the estate of an uncle who had made him his sole heir. Dantes' high education gave this account such plausibility that Jacopo did not doubt for a moment that his former companion had told him the truth.
025.009 On the other hand, as Edmund's engagement on board the _Jeune Amélie_ had expired, he took leave of the sailor, who at first tried to detain him, but who, having learned as Jacopo had done the story of the inheritance, gave up the hope of overcoming the resolution of his former sailor.
025.010 The next day Jacopo set sail for Marseilles; he was to meet Edmond at Monte Cristo.
025.011 That same day, Dantes left without saying where he was going, taking leave of the crew of the _Jeune-Amelie_ with a splendid gratuity, and of the skipper with the promise to give him news some day.
025.012 Dantes went to Genoa.
025.013 At the time of his arrival, a small yacht was being tested by an Englishman who, having heard that the Genoese were the best builders in the Mediterranean, had wanted to have a yacht built in Genoa; the Englishman had made a price of forty thousand francs: Dantes offered sixty thousand, on condition that the vessel would be delivered to him the same day. The Englishman had gone to Switzerland for a while, while waiting for his ship to be completed. He was not due back for three weeks or a month: the builder thought that he would have time to put another one on the yard. Dantes took the builder to a Jew's house, went with him into the back room and the Jew counted the builder sixty thousand francs.
025.014 The builder offered his services to Dantes to compose a crew for him; but Dantes thanked him, saying that he was used to sailing alone, and that the only thing he wanted was for a secret cupboard to be made in the cabin, at the head of the bed, in which there would also be three secret compartments. He gave the measure of these compartments, which were executed the next day.
025.015 Two hours later, Dantes left the port of Genoa, escorted by the eyes of a crowd of curious people who wanted to see the Spanish lord who was used to sailing alone.
025.016 Dantes did wonderfully; with the help of the rudder, and without needing to leave it, he made his ship make all the desired evolutions; one seemed an intelligent being ready to obey the least given impulse, and Dantes agreed in himself that the Genoese deserved their reputation of first builders of the world.
025.017 The curious followed the little ship with their eyes until they had lost sight of it, and then discussions arose as to where it was going: some leaned towards Corsica, others towards the island of Elba; these offered to bet that it was going to Spain, others maintained that it was going to Africa; no one thought of naming the island of Monte Cristo.
025.018 However, it was to Monte Cristo that Dantes went.
025.019 He arrived there towards the end of the second day: the ship was an excellent sailing ship and had covered the distance in thirty-five hours. Dantes had recognized the coastline perfectly, and instead of landing at the usual port, he dropped anchor in the small cove.
025.020 The island was deserted; nobody seemed to have landed there since Dantes had left; he went to his treasure: everything was in the same state as he had left it.
025.021 The next day, his immense fortune was transported aboard the yacht and locked in the three compartments of the secret cabinet.
025.022 Dantes waited another eight days. For eight days he maneuvered his yacht around the island, studying it as a squire studies a horse: at the end of this time he knew all its qualities and all its defects; Dantes promised himself to increase some and to remedy the others.
025.023 On the eighth day, Dantes saw a small ship coming towards the island with all sails set, and recognized Jacopo's boat; he made a signal to which Jacopo replied, and two hours later the boat was near the yacht.
025.024 There was a sad answer to each of the two requests made by Edmund.
025.025 Old Dantes was dead.
025.026 Mercedes had disappeared.
025.027 Edmund listened to these two pieces of news with a calm face; but immediately he went ashore, forbidding anyone to follow him there.
025.028 Two hours later he returned; two men from Jacopo's boat passed over to his yacht to help him maneuver, and he gave the order to set sail for Marseilles. He foresaw the death of his father; but what had become of Mercedes?
025.029 Without divulging his secret, Edmond could not give sufficient instructions to an agent; besides, there was other information that he wanted to take, and for which he relied only on himself. His mirror had taught him in Livorno that he did not run the danger of being recognized, besides he had now at his disposal all the means of disguising himself. One morning, therefore, the yacht, followed by the small boat, bravely entered the port of Marseilles and stopped just opposite the place where, that fatal evening, he had been taken on board for the Château d'If.
025.030 It was not without a certain shudder that, in the boat, Dantes saw a policeman coming towards him. But Dantes, with that perfect assurance which he had acquired, presented him with an English passport which he had bought in Livorno; and with this foreign pass, much more respected in France than ours, he went ashore without difficulty.
025.031 The first thing Dantes saw, as he set foot on the Canebière, was one of the sailors of the _Pharaon_. This man had served under him, and was there as a means of reassuring Dantes of the changes that had taken place in him. He went straight to this man and asked him several questions, to which the latter replied, without even giving any hint, either by his words or by his physiognomy, that he remembered ever having seen the one who was addressing him.
025.032 Dantes gave the sailor a coin to thank him for his information; a moment later he heard the good man running after him.
025.033 Dantes turned around.
025.034 "Pardon me, sir," said the sailor, "but you were undoubtedly mistaken; you thought you were giving me a forty-cent coin, and you gave me a double napoleon.
025.035 --In effect, my friend," said Dantes, "I was mistaken; but, as your honesty deserves a reward, here is a second one which I beg you to accept in order to drink to my health with your comrades."
025.036 The sailor looked at Edmund with such astonishment, that he did not even think of thanking him; and he watched him go away, saying:
025.037 "It's some nabob coming from India."
025.038 Dantes continued his way; every step he took oppressed his heart with a new emotion: all his childhood memories, indelible recollections, eternally present to the thought, were there, standing at every corner of the square, at every street corner, at every crossroads marker. When he reached the end of the rue de Noailles, and when he saw the Allées de Meilhan, he felt his knees bending, and he almost fell under the wheels of a car. Finally, he arrived at the house his father had lived in. The aristoloches and nasturtiums had disappeared from the attic, where once the good man's hand had trellised them with such care. He leaned against a tree, and remained for some time pensive, looking at the last floors of this poor little house; at last he advanced to the door, crossed the threshold, asked if there was not a vacant dwelling, and, although it was occupied, insisted so long on visiting that of the fifth, that the concierge went up and asked, on behalf of a stranger, the persons who inhabited it, permission to see the two rooms of which it was composed. The people who lived in this small apartment were a young man and a young woman who had been married only eight days before.
025.039 On seeing these two young people, Dantes sighed deeply.
025.040 Besides, nothing reminded Dantes of his father's apartment: it was no longer the same paper; all the old furniture, those childhood friends of Edmond's, present to his memory in all their details, were gone. Only the walls were the same.
025.041 Dantes turned to the side of the bed, it was there in the same place as that of the former tenant; in spite of himself, Edmond's eyes became wet with tears: it was in this place that the old man had had to expire by naming his son.
025.042 The two young people looked with astonishment at this man with the severe forehead, on whose cheeks two large tears ran without his face frowning. But, as all grief carries with it its religion, the young men made no questions to the stranger; only they withdrew back to let him weep at his ease, and when he withdrew they accompanied him, telling him that he could come back whenever he wished and that their poor house would always be hospitable to him.
025.043 Passing to the floor below, Edmond stopped at another door and asked if it was still the tailor Caderousse who lived there. But the concierge told him that the man he was talking about had done some bad business and was now running a small inn on the road from Bellegarde to Beaucaire.
025.044 Dantes went downstairs, asked for the address of the owner of the house on the Allées de Meilhan, went to his house, announced himself under the name of Lord Wilmore (that was the name and title on his passport), and bought the little house from him for the sum of twenty-five thousand francs. This was at least ten thousand francs more than it was worth. But Dantes, if he had made it half a million, would have paid that price.
025.045 That same day, the young men on the fifth floor were informed by the notary who had made the contract that the new owner was giving them a choice of an apartment in the whole house, without increasing their rent in any way, on condition that they give up the two rooms they were occupying.
025.046 This strange event occupied for more than eight days all the regulars of the Allées de Meilhan, and made them make a thousand conjectures, not one of which proved to be accurate.
025.047 But what especially confused all the brains and minds was that the same man who had been seen entering the house in the Allées de Meilhan was seen walking through the little village of the Catalans, and entering a poor fishermen's house where he stayed for more than an hour asking for news of several people who had died or disappeared for more than fifteen or sixteen years.
025.048 The next day, the people he had entered to ask all these questions received as a gift a brand new Catalan boat, equipped with two seines and a trawl net.
025.049 These good people would have liked to thank the generous questioner; but while leaving them one had seen him, after having given some orders to a sailor, to go up on horse and to leave Marseilles by the door of Aix.
026.000 The inn of the bridge of Gard.
026.001 Those who, like me, have walked through the South of France have noticed between Bellegarde and Beaucaire, about half way from the village to the city, but closer to Beaucaire than to Bellegarde, a small inn where hangs, on a sheet metal plate that creaks in the slightest wind, a grotesque representation of the Pont du Gard. This little inn, taking the course of the Rhone as a rule, is situated on the left side of the road, turning its back to the river; it is accompanied by what in Languedoc is called a garden: that is to say that the face opposite to that which opens its door to the travelers gives on an enclosure where crawl some stunted olive-trees and some wild fig trees with the foliage silvered by dust; in their intervals grow, for any vegetable, garlics, peppers and shallots; finally, with one of its angles, like a forgotten sentinel, a large umbrella pine elongates melancholically its flexible stem, while its top, spread out in fan, cracks under a sun of thirty degrees
026.002 All these trees, big or small, bend naturally in the direction where the mistral passes, one of the three scourges of Provence; the two others, as one knows or does not know, being the Durance and the Parliament.
026.003 Here and there, in the surrounding plain, which resembles a great lake of dust, vegetate some stalks of wheat that the horticulturists of the country raise undoubtedly by curiosity and each one of which is used as perch with a cicada which pursues with its sour and monotonous song the travelers lost in this thebaid.
026.004 For about seven or eight years, this small inn had been run by a man and a woman, with a maid called Trinette and a stable boy by the name of Pacaud as their only servants; a double cooperation which, moreover, was more than sufficient for the needs of the service, since a canal dug from Beaucaire to Aigues-mortes had victoriously replaced the boats with the accelerated transport, and the coach with the diligence.
026.005 This canal, as if to make the regrets of the unhappy innkeeper that it ruined even more vivid, passed between the Rhone which feeds it and the road that it drains, to a hundred steps or so of the inn of which we have just given a short but faithful description.
026.006 The innkeeper who ran this small inn was a man of forty to forty-five years of age, tall, dry and wiry, a true southern type with his deep-set and brilliant eyes, his eagle-beak nose and his white teeth like those of a carnivorous animal. His hair, which seemed, in spite of the first breaths of age, unable to decide to whiten, was, as well as his beard, which he wore as a collar, thick, frizzy and barely dotted with a few white hairs. His complexion, naturally tanned, was still covered with a new layer of bistre by the habit that the poor devil had taken to stand from the morning until the evening on the threshold of his door, to see if, either on foot, or in the car, it did not arrive to him some practice: waiting almost always disappointed, and during which he opposed to the devouring ardor of the sun of another preservative for his face that a red handkerchief tied on his head, with the manner of the Spanish muleteers. This man was our old acquaintance Gaspard Caderousse.
026.007 His wife, on the other hand, who, from her daughter's name, was called Madeleine Radelle, was a pale, thin and sickly woman; born in the vicinity of Arles, she had, while preserving the primitive traces of the traditional beauty of her compatriots, seen her face slowly decay in the almost continual attack of one of those dull fevers so common among the populations near the ponds of Aigues-mortes and the marshes of the Camargue. She therefore almost always sat shivering at the back of her room on the second floor, either stretched out in an armchair or leaning against her bed, while her husband went up to the door for his usual faction: a faction that he prolonged all the more willingly because each time he found himself with his bitter half, she pursued him with her eternal complaints against fate, complaints to which her husband usually only replied with these philosophical words:
026.008 "Shut up, Carconte! It's God's will this way."
026.009 This sobriquet came from the fact that Madeleine Radelle had been born in the village of la Carconte, situated between Salon and Lambesc. Now, following a habit of the country, which wants that one almost always designates people by a nickname instead of designating them by a name, her husband had substituted this appellation for that of Madeleine, too soft and too euphonious perhaps for his rough language.
026.010 However, in spite of this pretended resignation to the decrees of Providence, let it not be believed that our innkeeper did not feel deeply the state of misery to which this miserable canal of Beaucaire had reduced him, and that he was invulnerable to the incessant complaints with which his wife pursued him. He was, like all southerners, a sober man without great needs, but vain for external things; Also, at the time of his prosperity, he did not let pass neither a ferrade, nor a procession of the tarasque without showing himself there with the Carconte, the one in this picturesque costume of the men of the South and which holds at the same time of the Catalan and the Andalusian; the other with this charming dress of the women of Arles which seems borrowed from Greece and Arabia; but little by little, chains of watches, necklaces, belted with the thousand colors, embroidered bodices, velvet jackets, stockings with elegant corners, gaiters bariolées, shoes with silver buckles had disappeared, and Gaspard Caderousse, not being able to show himself any more with the height of his former splendor, had renounced for himself and for his wife all these worldly pomp, whose joyful noises he heard, while gnawing his heart deafly, resounding up to this poor inn, which he continued to keep much more as a shelter than as a speculation.
026. 011 Caderousse had thus stood, as was his habit, a part of the morning in front of the door, walking his melancholy gaze from a small peeled lawn, where a few hens were pecking, to the two ends of the deserted path which went on one side to the south and the other to the north, when suddenly the sour voice of his wife forced him to leave his post; He returned grumbling and went up to the second floor, leaving the door wide open as if to invite travelers not to forget him as they passed.
026.012 At the moment when Caderousse returned, the great road of which we spoke, and which his eyes traversed, was as naked and as solitary as the desert at midday; it extended, white and infinite, between two rows of thin trees, and one understood perfectly that no traveler, free to choose another hour of the day, ventured into this appalling Sahara.
026. 013 However, in spite of all the odds, if he had remained at his post, Caderousse could have seen a rider and a horse coming from the side of Bellegarde with that honest and friendly look which indicates the best relations between horse and rider; the horse was a gelding, walking pleasantly at amble; the rider was a priest dressed in black and wearing a three-horned hat, despite the devouring heat of the sun then at its noon; they were both going at a very reasonable trot.
026. 014 Arrived in front of the door, the group stopped: it would have been difficult to decide whether it was the horse which stopped the man or the man who stopped the horse; but in any case the rider put his foot down, and, pulling the animal by the bridle, he went to attach it to the turnstile of a dilapidated windscreen which was only held up by a hinge; Then advancing towards the door, wiping with a red cotton handkerchief his forehead streaming with sweat, the priest struck three blows on the threshold, with the iron end of the cane which he held in his hand.
026.015 Immediately a large black dog rose and took a few steps, barking and showing its sharp white teeth; a double hostile demonstration which proved how little he was used to society.
026.016 Immediately a heavy step shook the wooden staircase crawling along the wall, and which the guest of the poor house at whose door the priest was standing was descending, bending down and backwards.
026.017 "Here I am!" said Caderousse all astonished, "here I am! will you be silent, Margottin! Do not be afraid, sir, he barks, but he does not bite. You want some wine, don't you? because he is a hot mess.... Ah! pardon," interrupted Caderousse, seeing what sort of traveler he was dealing with, "I did not know whom I had the honor of receiving; what do you desire, what do you ask, monsieur l'abbé? I am at your orders."
026.018 The priest looked at this man for two or three seconds with a strange attention, he even seemed to seek to draw the attention of the innkeeper to himself; then, seeing that the latter's features expressed no other feeling than surprise at not receiving an answer, he judged that it was time to put an end to this surprise, and said with a very pronounced Italian accent:
026.019 "Are you not monsou Caderousse?
026.020 --Yes, sir," said the host, perhaps even more astonished at the request than he had been at the silence, "I am indeed; Gaspard Caderousse, to serve you.
026.021 --Gaspard Caderousse... yes, I believe that is the first and last name; you used to live in the Allées de Meilhan, didn't you?
026.022 --That's right.
026.023 --And you were a tailor?
026.024 -- Yes, but the state has turned out badly: it is so hot in this rascal of Marseille that one will end up, I believe, by not dressing there at all. But speaking of heat, don't you want to cool off, Father?
026.025 -If you do, give me a bottle of your best wine, and we'll take up the conversation, please, where we left off.
026.026 --As it will please you, Mr. Abbot" said Caderousse.
026.027 And not to lose this occasion to place one of the last bottles of wine of Cahors which remained to him, Caderousse hastened to raise a trap door practised in the floor even of this kind of room of the first floor, which was used at the same time of room and kitchen.
026.028 When at the end of five minutes he returned, he found the abbot seated on a stepladder, his elbow leaning on a long table, while Margottin, who seemed to have made his peace with him on hearing that, against the habit, this singular traveler was going to take something, stretched out his gaunt neck and his languid eye on his thigh.
026.029 "Are you alone?" asked the abbot to his host, while the latter placed the bottle and a glass before him.
026.030 --Oh, my God! yes! alone, or more or less, Mr. Abbot; for I have my wife who cannot help me in anything, since she is always sick, poor Carconte.
026.031 --Ah! you are married! said the priest with a sort of interest, and casting around him a glance which seemed to estimate the meager furniture of the poor household at its thin value.
026.032 --You think I am not rich, don't you, Monsieur l'abbé?" said Caderousse, sighing; "but what do you want! it is not enough to be an honest man to prosper in this world.
026.033 The abbot fixed a piercing glance on him.
026.034 "Yes, honest man; of that I can boast, sir," said the host, holding the abbot's gaze with one hand on his breast and nodding his head up and down; "and in our time not everyone can say the same.
026.035 --About as well if what you boast about is true, said the abbot; for sooner or later, I am firmly convinced, the honest man is rewarded and the wicked punished.
026.036 -It is your state to say that, Monsieur l'abbé; it is your state to say that, Caderousse continued with a bitter expression; after that, one is free not to believe what you say.
026.037 -- You are wrong to speak thus, sir, said the abbot, for perhaps I myself will be for you, just now, a proof of what I am saying.
026.038 --What do you mean?" asked Caderousse with an astonished air.
026.039 -- I mean that I must first make sure that you are the one I am dealing with.
026.040 -- What proof do you want me to give you?
026.041 --Did you know in 1814 or 1815 a sailor named Dantes?
026.042 --Dantes!... if I knew him, poor Edmond! I believe so! he was even one of my best friends! exclaimed Caderousse, whose face flushed crimson, while the clear and assured eye of the abbot seemed to dilate to cover entirely the one he was questioning.
026.043 --Yes, I believe indeed that his name was Edmond.
026.044 -I believe he was called Edmond, the little one! as true as my name is Gaspard Caderousse. And what has become of poor Edmond, sir?" continued the innkeeper; "have you met him? is he still living? is he free? is he happy?
026.045 --He died a prisoner, more desperate and more miserable than the convicts who drag their ball and chain to the prison of Toulon.
026.046 A mortal pallor succeeded on Caderousse's face to the redness that had first seized it. He turned around and the abbot saw him wiping away a tear with a corner of the red handkerchief that served as his headdress.
026.047 "Poor little one!" murmured Caderousse. Well, here is another proof of what I was telling you, Monsieur l'Abbé, that the Good Lord was only good to the bad. Ah! continued Caderousse, with the colorful language of the people of the South, the world is going from bad to worse, so let two days of powder and one hour of fire fall from heaven, and let everything be said!
026.048 -- You seem to love this boy with all your heart, sir, asked the abbot.
026.049 -- Yes, I loved him well, said Caderousse, although I have to reproach myself for having envied his happiness for a moment. But since then, I swear to you, faith of Caderousse, I have pitied his unfortunate fate."
026.050 There was a moment of silence during which the fixed gaze of the abbot did not cease for a moment to interrogate the mobile physiognomy of the innkeeper.
026.051 "And you knew him, poor boy?" continued Caderousse.
026.052 -- I was called to his deathbed to offer him the last aid of religion," replied the abbot.
026.053 --And of what did he die?" asked Caderousse in a choked voice.
026.054 --And of what does one die in prison when one dies there at thirty, if not of the prison itself?"
026.055 Caderousse wiped the sweat that ran from his forehead.
026.056 "What is strange in all this," continued the abbot, "is that Dantes, on his deathbed, on the Christ whose feet he kissed, always swore to me that he did not know the true cause of his captivity.
026.057 --That's true, that's true, Caderousse murmured, he couldn't have known it; no, Monsieur l'Abbé, he wasn't lying, poor fellow.
026.058 --That is why he charged me with clearing up his misfortune, which he had never been able to clear up himself, and with rehabilitating his memory, if that memory had received any stain."
026.059 And the abbot's gaze, becoming more and more fixed, devoured the almost gloomy expression that appeared on Caderousse's face.
026.060 "A rich Englishman," continued the abbot, "his companion in misfortune, and who came out of prison, at the second Restoration, was the owner of a diamond of great value. On leaving prison, he wanted to leave Dantes, who, in an illness he had suffered, had cared for him like a brother, a testimony of his gratitude by leaving him this diamond.
026.061 Dantes, instead of using it to seduce his jailers, who moreover could take it and betray him afterwards, always kept it preciously for the case where he came out of prison; for if he came out of prison, his fortune was assured by the sale of this diamond alone.
026.062 -Was it, then, as you say," asked Caderousse with burning eyes, "a diamond of great value?
026.063 --All is relative, the abbot continued; of great value to Edmond; this diamond was estimated at fifty thousand francs.
026.064 --Fifty thousand francs! said Caderousse; but was it as big as a walnut?
026.065 --No, not quite, said the abbot, but you will judge for yourself, for I have it with me."
026.066 Caderousse seemed to look under the abbot's clothes for the deposit of which he spoke.
026.067 The abbot drew from his pocket a small black chagrin box, opened it, and flashed before Caderousse's dazzled eyes the sparkling marvel mounted on a ring of admirable workmanship.
026.068 "And this is worth fifty thousand francs?
026.069 --Without the setting, which is itself of a certain price," said the abbot.
026.070 And he closed the case, and put back into his pocket the diamond that continued to sparkle in Caderousse's mind.
026.071 "But how do you come to have this diamond in your possession, Monsieur l'abbé?" asked Caderousse. So Edmond has made you his heir?
026.072 -- No, but his executor. "I had three good friends and a fiancée," he told me: "all four of them, I am sure, regret me bitterly: one of these good friends was called Caderousse."
026.073 Caderousse shuddered.
026.074 "--The other," continued the abbe without seeming to notice Caderousse's emotion, "the other was called Danglars; the third," he added, "though my rival, loved me too."
026.075 A devilish smile lit up Caderousse's features, and he made a movement to interrupt the abbe.
026.076 "Wait," said the abbe, "let me finish, and if you have any observation to make, you will make it to me presently. "The other, though my rival, loved me too and was called Fernand; as for my fiancée her name was..." I don't remember the name of the fiancée," said the abbot.
026.077 --Mercedes, said Caderousse.
026.078 --Ah, yes, that's it," said the abbot with a stifled sigh, "Mercédès.
026.079 --Well?" asked Caderousse.
026.080 --Give me a jug of water," said the abbot.
026.081 Caderousse hastened to obey.
026.082 The abbot filled the glass and drank a few sips.
026.083 "Where were we?" he asked, placing his glass on the table.
026.084 --The bride's name was Mercedes.
026.085 --Yes, that's right. "You will go to Marseilles..." It is always Dantes who speaks, do you understand?
026.086 --Perfectly.
026.087 -- "You will sell this diamond, you will make five shares and you will divide them among these good friends, the only people who have loved me on earth!"
026.088 --How five shares?" said Caderousse, "you have only named four people.
026.089 --Because the fifth is dead, I am told.... The fifth was the father of Dantes.
026.090 -- Alas! yes, said Caderousse moved by the passions which were clashing within him; alas! yes, the poor man, he is dead.
026.091 --I learned of this event in Marseilles, replied the abbot, making an effort to appear indifferent, but it is so long since this death occurred that I have not been able to gather any details.... Would you know anything about the end of this old man?
026.092 --Eh! said Caderousse, who can know that better than I? I lived door to door with the good man.... My God! yes: hardly a year after the disappearance of his son, he died, the poor old man!
026.093 --But what did he die of?
026.094 --The doctors called his illness... gastro-enteritis, I believe; those who knew him said he died of pain... and I, who almost saw him die, say that he died..."
026.095 Caderousse stopped. "Dead of what?" resumed the priest anxiously.
026.096 --Well, dead of hunger!
026.097 -Hungry?" cried the abbot, leaping up on his stepladder, "from hunger! The vilest animals do not die of hunger! the dogs that roam the streets find a compassionate hand that throws them a piece of bread; and a man, a Christian, died of hunger in the midst of other men who call themselves Christians like him! Impossible! Oh, it is impossible!
026.098 -- I have said what I have said, Caderousse continued.
026.099 --And you are wrong, said a voice on the stairs, what are you meddling with?"
026.100 The two men turned, and saw through the bars of the banister the sickly head of Carconte; she had dragged herself up there and was listening to the conversation, sitting on the last step, her head leaning on her knees.
026.101 "What are you meddling with yourself, woman?" said Caderousse. Monsieur asks for information, politeness demands that I give it to him.
026.102 --Yes, but prudence requires that you refuse them. Who is to say with what intention they want to make you speak, you fool?
026.103 -In an excellent way, madam, I can tell you," said the abbot. So your husband has nothing to fear, as long as he answers frankly.
026.104 --Nothing to fear, yes! One begins with fine promises, then is content, afterwards, to say that one has nothing to fear; then one goes away without keeping anything of what one has said, and one fine morning misfortune falls on the poor world without one knowing where it comes from.
026.105 --Be quiet, good woman, misfortune will not come to you from my side, I answer you."
026.106 The Carconte muttered a few words that could not be heard, let her head fall back on her knees for a moment raised and continued to tremble with fever, leaving her husband free to continue the conversation, but placed in such a way as not to lose a word.
026.107 Meanwhile, the abbot had drunk a few sips of water and had recovered.
026.108 "But was this unfortunate old man so abandoned by everyone that he died such a death?
026.109 --Oh, sir," continued Caderousse, "it is not that Mercedes the Catalan or M. Morrel abandoned him; but the poor old man had taken a deep dislike to Fernand, the very man," continued Caderousse with an ironic smile, "whom Dantes told you was his friend.
026.110 --Wasn't he then? said the abbot.
026.111 --Gaspard! Gaspard!" murmured the woman from the top of her stairs, "be careful what you say.
026.112 Caderousse made a movement of impatience, and without granting any other answer to the one who interrupted him:
026.113 "Can one be the friend of one whose wife one covets?" he replied to the abbe. Dantes, who was a heart of gold, called all these people his friends.... Poor Edmond!... In fact, it is better that he did not know anything; he would have had too much trouble forgiving them at the moment of his death.... And, whatever they say," Caderousse continued in his language, which was not lacking in a kind of harsh poetry, "I am even more afraid of the curse of the dead than of the hatred of the living.
026.114 -- Fool!" said the Carconte.
026.115 -Do you know, then," continued the abbot, "what Fernand has done against Dantes?
026.116 --If I know, I believe it.
026.117 --Speak up then.
026.118 --Gaspard, do what you want, you are the master, said the woman; but if you believed me, you would say nothing.
026.119 -This time I think you are right, woman, said Caderousse.
026.120 -So you don't want to say anything? continued the abbot.
026.121 --What's the use! said Caderousse. If the boy were alive and came to me to know once and for all his friends and enemies, I would not say; but he is underground, as you told me, he can no longer have hatred, he can no longer take revenge. Let's turn it all off.
026.122 --You want me to give these people, whom you give for unworthy and false friends, a reward for fidelity?
026.123 --That is true, you are right, said Caderousse. Besides, what would poor Edmond's legacy be to them now? A drop of water falling into the sea!
026.124 - "Not to mention that those people can crush you with a gesture," said the woman.
026.125 -How come? These people have become rich and powerful?
026.126 --So you don't know their story?
026.127 --No, tell it to me."
026.128 Caderousse seemed to think for a moment.
026.129 "No, in truth," he said, "it would take too long.
026.130 -Free to keep quiet, my friend," said the abbe with an accent of the deepest indifference, "and I respect your scruples; besides, what you are doing here is the work of a really good man: let us not speak of it any more. What was I charged with? A simple formality. I will therefore sell this diamond."
026.131 And he drew the diamond from his pocket, opened the case, and made it shine before the dazzled eyes of Caderousse.
026.132 "Come and see, woman!" said the latter in a hoarse voice.
026.133 --A diamond!" said the Carconte, rising and descending the staircase with a rather firm step, "what is this diamond?
026.134 -- Didn't you hear, woman? said Caderousse, it is a diamond that the little one bequeathed to us: to his father first, to his three friends Fernand, Danglars and me, and to Mercédès his fiancée. The diamond is worth fifty thousand francs.
026.135 --Oh! the beautiful jewel! she said.
026.136 --The fifth of this sum belongs to us, then? said Caderousse.
026.137 --Yes, sir," replied the abbot, "plus the share of Dantes' father, which I believe I am authorized to divide among the four of you.
026.138 --And why on the four of us? asked the Carconte.
026.139 --Because you were the four friends of Edmond.
026.140 --Friends are not those who betray! murmured the woman in turn.
026.141 --Yes, yes, said Caderousse, and that is what I was saying: it is almost a profanation, almost a sacrilege, to reward treason, perhaps a crime.
026.142 - "It is you who will have wanted it," the abbot quietly resumed, putting the diamond back into the pocket of his cassock; "now give me the address of Edmond's friends, so that I can execute his last wishes."
026.143 The sweat ran in heavy drops from Caderousse's forehead; he saw the abbot rise, move toward the door, as if to glance at his horse for advice, and return.
026.144 Caderousse and his wife looked at each other with an inexpressible expression.
026.145 "The diamond would be all for us," said Caderousse.
026.146 "Do you think so?" replied the woman.
026.147 --A man of the cloth would not want to deceive us.
026.148 --Do as you please, said the woman; as for me, I don't interfere."
026.149 And she went back up the stairs all shivering; her teeth were chattering, in spite of the fierce heat it was making.
026.150 On the last step she stopped for a moment.
026.151 "Think hard, Gaspard!" she said.
026.152 --I am decided," said Caderousse.
026.153 La Carconte returned to her room with a sigh; the ceiling could be heard screaming under her steps until she had reached her armchair, where she fell heavily into her seat.
026.154 "What have you decided?" asked the abbot.
026.155 -- To tell you everything," he replied.
026.156 -- I think, in truth, that is the best thing to do," said the priest; "not that I want to know the things you want to hide from me; but in the end, you can get me to distribute the legacies according to the wishes of the testator; that will be better.
026.157 -- I hope so, Caderousse replied, his cheeks inflamed with the redness of hope and greed.
026.158 -- I am listening to you, said the abbot.
026.159 --Wait, Caderousse resumed, we could be interrupted at the most interesting place, and that would be unpleasant; besides, it is useless for anyone to know that you have come here."
026.160 And he went to the door of his inn and closed the door, to which, as an added precaution, he put the night bar.
026.161 Meanwhile the abbot had chosen his place to listen at his ease; he sat in a corner, so as to remain in the shadow, while the light would fall full upon the face of his interlocutor. As for him, the head inclined, the hands joined or rather clenched, he prepared to listen with all his ears.
026.162 Caderousse approached a stepladder and sat down opposite him.
026.163 "Remember that I'm not pushing you into anything!" said the trembling voice of Carconte, as if, through the floor, she could have seen the scene that was preparing.
026.164 - "That's fine, that's fine," said Caderousse, "let's not talk about it anymore; I'll take it all on myself."
026.165 And he began.
027.000 The story.
027.001 "First of all," said Caderousse, "I must ask you, sir, to promise me one thing.
027.002 -What?" asked the abbot.
027.003 --That if you make any use of the details I am going to give you, it will never be known that these details come from me, because those of which I am going to speak to you are rich and powerful, and, if they only touched me with the tip of the finger, they would break me like glass.
027. 004 "Be quiet, my friend," said the abbot, "I am a priest, and confessions die in my bosom; remember that we have no other aim than to fulfill our friend's last wishes in a dignified manner; speak, then, without sparing any thought or hatred; tell the truth, the whole truth: I do not know and probably never will know the people of whom you are going to speak to me; besides, I am Italian and not French; I belong to God and not to men, and I am going to return to my convent, from which I left only to fulfill the last wishes of a dying man. "
027.005 This positive promise seemed to give Caderousse some assurance.
027.006 "Well, in this case," said Caderousse, "I want, I will even say more, I must disabuse you of these friendships that poor Edmond believed to be sincere and devoted.
027.007 - Let us begin with his father, if you please, said the abbot. Edmund told me a lot about this old man, for whom he had a deep love.
027.008 --The story is sad, sir, said Caderousse, shaking his head; you probably know the beginnings.
027.009 --Yes, replied the abbot, Edmond told me the story up to the moment when he was arrested, in a little cabaret near Marseille.
027.010 -- In the Reserve! Oh my God, yes! I still see the thing as if I were there.
027.011 -- Wasn't it at the very meal of his engagement?
027.012 -- Yes, and the meal which had had a happy beginning had a sad end: a police commissioner followed by four riflemen entered, and Dantes was arrested.
027.013 --That is where what I know ends, sir," said the priest; "Dantes himself knew nothing but what was absolutely personal to him, for he never saw any of the five persons I named, nor heard of them.
027.014 --Well, once Dantes was arrested, M. Morrel ran to get information: it was very sad. The old man returned alone to his house, folded his wedding garment and wept, spent the whole day going to and fro in his room, and in the evening did not go to bed, for I stayed below him and heard him walking all night; I myself, I must say, did not sleep either, for the pain of this poor father hurt me greatly, and each of his steps crushed my heart, as if he had really put his foot on my chest.
027.015 "The next day, Mercédès came to Marseilles to implore the protection of M. de Villefort: she obtained nothing; but, at the same time, she went to visit the old man. When she saw him so gloomy and downcast, that he had spent the night without going to bed, that he had not eaten since the day before, she wanted to take him to take care of him, but the old man would never consent.
027.016 "--No," he said, "I will not leave the house, for it is I whom my poor child loves above all things, and, if he comes out of prison, it is I whom he will come to see first. What would he say if I were not there waiting for him?
027.017 "I listened to all this from the square, for I would have liked Mercedes to make the old man follow her; that step resounding every day on my head did not leave me a moment's rest.
027.018 -Weren't you going up to the old man yourself to console him?
027.019 --Ah, sir! replied Caderousse, one consoles only those who want to be consoled, and he did not want to be consoled: besides, I don't know why, but it seemed to me that he was reluctant to see me. One night, however, when I heard his sobs, I could not resist and went upstairs; but when I arrived at the door, he was no longer sobbing, he was praying. What he found eloquent words and pitiful supplications, I cannot tell you again, sir: it was more than piety, it was more than sorrow; also, I, who am not a cagot and who do not like the Jesuits, said to myself that day: It is fortunate, in truth, that I am alone, and that the Good Lord has not sent me any children, for if I were a father and felt a pain similar to that of the poor old man, not being able to find in my memory or in my heart all that he says to the Good Lord, I would go straight to the sea to avoid suffering any longer.
027.020 - Poor Father!" murmured the priest.
027.021 - Day by day he lived more alone and more isolated: often Mr. Morrel and Mercedes came to see him, but his door was closed; and, although I was quite sure he was at home, he did not answer. One day, against his custom, he had received Mercedes, and the poor child, in despair herself, tried to comfort him:
027.022 "--Believe me, my daughter," he said to her, "he is dead; and, instead of us waiting for him, it is he who is waiting for us: I am very happy, it is I who am the oldest and who, therefore, will see him again first.
027.023 "No matter how good one is, you see, one soon ceases to see the people who sadden you; old Dantes ended up remaining quite alone: from time to time I could only see unknown people going up to his house, who came down with some ill-concealed parcel; I have since understood what these parcels were: he sold little by little what he had to live on. Finally, the good man arrived at the end of his poor clothes; he owed three terms: they threatened to send him away; he asked for eight more days, they granted him. I knew this detail because the owner entered my house when he left it.
027.024 "For the first three days I heard him walking as usual; but on the fourth day I heard nothing. I ventured upstairs: the door was closed; but through the lock I saw him so pale and defeated that, judging him to be quite ill, I sent for Mr. Morrel and ran to Mercedes. Both of them hastened to come. Mr. Morrel brought a doctor; the doctor recognized a gastro-enteritis and ordered a diet. I was there, sir, and I will never forget the smile of the old man at this order.
027.025 "From that moment on, he opened his door: he had an excuse not to eat anymore; the doctor had ordered the diet."
027.026 The abbot gave a sort of groan.
027.027 "This story interests you, doesn't it, sir?" said Caderousse.
027.028 --Yes, answered the abbot; it is touching.
027.029 --Mercedes returned; she found him so changed, that, as the first time, she wanted to have him taken to her house. It was also the opinion of Mr. Morrel, who wanted to carry out the transport by force; but the old man shouted so much that they were afraid. Mercédès remained at the bedside. M. Morrel moved away, signalling to the Catalan woman that he was leaving a purse on the way. But, armed with the doctor's prescription, the old man would not take anything. Finally, after nine days of despair and abstinence, the old man expired, cursing those who had caused his misfortune and saying to Mercédès:
027.030 "--If you see my Edmond again, tell him that I die blessing him."
027.031 The abbot rose, made two turns in the room, bringing a quivering hand to his arid throat.
027.032 "And you believe that he is dead....
027.033 --From hunger... sir, from hunger," said Caderousse; "I answer for it as truly as we are two Christians here."
027.034 The abbot, with a convulsive hand, seized the glass of water still half full, emptied it in one gulp, and sat down with reddened eyes and pale cheeks.
027.035 "Admit that this is a great misfortune!" he said in a hoarse voice.
027.036 -All the more great, sir, since God has nothing to do with it, and men alone are the cause.
027.037 -Let's move on to these men, said the abbot; but think about it," he continued with an almost threatening air, "you've promised to tell me everything: let's see, who are these men who caused the son to die of despair and the father to starve?
027.038 --Two men jealous of him, sir, one by love, the other by ambition: Fernand and Danglars.
027.039 --And in what way did this jealousy manifest itself, say?
027.040 --They denounced Edmond as a Bonapartist agent.
027.041 --But which of the two denounced him, which of the two was the true culprit.
027.042 --Both of them, sir, one wrote the letter, the other mailed it.
027.043 -- And where was this letter written?
027.044 -- At the Reserve, the day before the wedding.
027.045 -That's right, that's right, murmured the abbot. O Faria! Faria! How well you knew men and things!
027.046 --You say, sir?" asked Caderousse.
027.047 --Nothing, continued the priest; go on.
027.048 --It was Danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand so that his handwriting would not be recognized, and Fernand who sent it.
027.049 --But, cried the abbot suddenly, you were there!
027.050 --Me!" said Caderousse astonished; "who told you that I was there?
027.051 The abbot saw that he had launched himself too far ahead.
027.052 "No one," he said, "but to be so well acquainted with all these details, you must have witnessed them.
027.053 --That's true, said Caderousse in a muffled voice, I was there.
027.054 --And you did not oppose this infamy? said the abbot; then you are their accomplice.
027.055 --Sir, said Caderousse, they had made me drink both to the point that I had almost lost the reason of it. I did not see any more but through a cloud. I said all that a man in this state can say; but they answered me both that it was a joke which they had wanted to make, and that this joke would not have continuation.
027.056 -The next day, sir, the next day, you saw that she had some; however, you said nothing; you were there, however, when he was arrested.
027.057 --Yes, sir, I was there and I wanted to speak, I wanted to say everything, but Danglars held me back.
027.058 -- "And if he is guilty, by chance," he said to me, "if he has really been released on the island of Elba, if he is really in charge of a letter for the Bonapartist committee of Paris, if this letter is found on him, those who have supported him will be considered his accomplices.
027.059 "I was afraid of politics as it was then being done, I confess; I kept silent, it was a cowardice, I agree, but it was not a crime.
027.060 -- I understand; you let it happen, that's all.
027.061 -- Yes, sir," replied Caderousse, "and that is my remorse of the night and the day. I often ask God for forgiveness, I swear to you, especially since this action, the only one that I have seriously reproached myself for in the whole course of my life, is without doubt the cause of my adversities. I am atoning for a moment of selfishness; also, this is what I always say to Carconte when she complains: "Shut up, woman, it is God's will so."
027.062 And Caderousse bowed his head with all the signs of true repentance.
027.063 "Well, sir," said the abbot, "you have spoken frankly; to accuse oneself thus is to deserve one's pardon.
027.064 --Unfortunately, said Caderousse, Edmond is dead and has not forgiven me!
027.065 --He did not know, said the abbot....
027.066 --But he knows now, perhaps, resumed Caderousse; they say that the dead know everything."
027.067 There was a moment's silence: the abbe had risen and was walking about pensively; he returned to his seat and sat down again.
027.068 "You have already named me two or three times a certain Mr. Morrel," he said. What was this man?
027.069 --He was the owner of the _Pharaon_, Dantes' boss.
027.070 --And what part did this man play in all this sad business?
027.071 --The role of an honest, courageous, and affectionate man, sir. Twenty times he interceded for Edmond; when the emperor returned, he wrote, prayed, threatened, so that at the second Restoration he was much persecuted as a Bonapartist. Ten times, as I told you, he had come to Father Dantes' house to take him home, and the day before or the day before his death, as I told you again, he had left a purse on the mantelpiece with which they paid the good man's debts and provided for his burial; so that the poor old man could at least die as he had lived, without harming anyone. It is still me who has the purse, a large purse in red net.
027.072 -- And, asked the abbot, is this Mr. Morrel still living?
027.073 -- Yes, said Caderousse.
027.074 --In this case, continued the abbot, he must be a man blessed by God, he must be rich... happy..."
027.075 Caderousse smiled bitterly.
027.076 "Yes, happy, like me," he said.
027.077 --M. Morrel would be unhappy!" cried the abbot.
027.078 --He is touching misery, sir, and much more, he is touching dishonor.
027.079 --How so?
027.080 -- Yes, Caderousse continued, it is like that; after twenty-five years of work, after having acquired the most honorable place in the commerce of Marseilles, M. Morrel is ruined from top to bottom. He has lost five ships in two years, has suffered three appalling bankruptcies, and has no hope left except in the same _Pharaon_ which poor Dantes commanded, and which is to return from India with a cargo of cochineal and indigo. If this ship misses like the others, it is lost.
027.081 -- And, said the abbot, does the unfortunate man have a wife and children?
027.082 -- Yes, he has a wife who, in all this, behaves like a saint; he has a daughter who was going to marry a man she loved, and whose family will not let her marry a ruined daughter; he has a son, a lieutenant in the army; but, as you can well understand, all this doubles his pain instead of softening it, for this poor dear man. If he were alone, he would burn his brains and all would be said.
027.083 --That's awful!" murmured the priest.
027.084 --That is how God rewards virtue, sir, said Caderousse. I, who have never done a bad deed except what I have told you, am in misery; I, after having seen my poor wife die of fever, without being able to do anything for her, will die of hunger as Father Dantes died, while Fernand and Danglars are rolling in gold.
027.085 --And how?
027.086 --Because everything has turned out well for them, while for honest people everything turns out badly.
027.087 --What has become of Danglars? the most guilty, is it not, the instigator?
027.088 -- What has become of him? He has left Marseilles; he has entered, on the recommendation of M. Morrel, who was unaware of his crime. Morrel, who was unaware of his crime, as a clerk in a Spanish banker's office; at the time of the Spanish war he took a share in the supplies of the French army and made a fortune; then, with this first money he gambled on the funds, and tripled, quadrupled his capital, and, widower himself of his banker's daughter, he married a widow, Mme. de Nargonne, daughter of M. Servieux, chamberlain of the present king, and who enjoys the greatest favor. He had made himself a millionaire, he was made a baron; so that he is now Baron Danglars, he has a hotel in the rue du Mont-Blanc, ten horses in his stables, six lackeys in his anteroom, and I don't know how many millions in his coffers.
027.089 --Ah!" said the abbot with a singular accent; "and he is happy?
027.090 --Ah! happy, who can say that? The misfortune or the happiness, it is the secret of the walls; the walls have ears, but they do not have a language; if one is happy with a great fortune, Danglars is happy.
027.091 --And Fernand?
027.092 --Fernand, that is something else again.
027.093 --But how could a poor Catalan fisherman, without resources, without education, have made his fortune? It passes me by, I confess to you.
027.094 --And that passes everyone too; there must be some strange secret in his life that no one knows.
027.095 --But finally by what visible rungs did he climb to this high fortune or to this high position?
027.096 -- To both, sir, to both! He has fortune and position together.
027.097 --This is a tale you are telling me.
027.098 --The fact is that it looks like one; but listen, and you will understand.
027.099 "Fernand, a few days before the return, had fallen to the conscription. The Bourbons left him well alone in the Catalans, but Napoleon returned, an extraordinary levy was decreed, and Fernand was forced to leave. I also left, but since I was older than Fernand and had just married my poor wife, I was sent to the coast only.
027.100 "Fernand was enrolled in the active troops, went to the border with his regiment, and attended the battle of Ligny.
027.101 "The night after the battle, he was a guard at the door of the general who had secret relations with the enemy. That very night the general was to join the English. He proposed to Fernand that he accompany him; Fernand accepted, left his post and followed the general.
027.102 "What would have made Fernand go to a council of war if Napoleon had remained on the throne served as a recommendation to the Bourbons. He returned to France with the epaulette of second lieutenant; and as the protection of the general, who is in high favor, did not abandon him, he was a captain in 1823, at the time of the Spanish war, that is to say at the very moment when Danglars risked his first speculations. Fernand was Spanish, he was sent to Madrid to study the spirit of his compatriots; He found Danglars there, made friends with him, promised his general support among the royalists of the capital and the provinces, received promises, made commitments on his side, guided his regiment by paths known only to him through gorges guarded by royalists, and finally rendered such services in this short campaign that after the capture of the Trocadero he was named colonel and received the cross of officer of the Legion of Honor with the title of count.
027.103 --Destiny! destiny! murmured the abbot.
027.104 --Yes, but listen, that's not all. The Spanish war was over, and Ferdinand's career was jeopardized by the long peace which promised to reign in Europe. Greece alone had risen up against Turkey, and had just begun the war of its independence; all eyes were turned towards Athens: it was the fashion to pity and support the Greeks. The French government, without openly protecting them, as you know, tolerated partial migrations. Fernand asked for and obtained permission to go and serve in Greece, remaining nevertheless on the army's payroll.
027.105 "Some time later it was learned that the Count of Morcerf, which was his name, had entered the service of Ali-Pacha with the rank of instructor general.
027.106 "Ali-Pacha was killed, as you know; but before he died he rewarded Fernand's services by leaving him a considerable sum with which Fernand returned to France, where his rank of lieutenant general was confirmed.
027.107 -So that today?
027.108 --So that today," Caderousse continued, "he owns a magnificent hotel in Paris, rue du Helder, no. 27."
027.109 The abbe opened his mouth, remained for a moment like a man hesitating, but making an effort on himself:
027.110 "And Mercedes," he said, "I have been assured that she has disappeared?
027.111 --Disappeared, said Caderousse, yes, as the sun disappears to rise the next day more brightly.
027.112 -Did she make her fortune too? asked the abbot with an ironic smile.
027.113 --Mercedes is at this time one of the greatest ladies of Paris, said Caderousse.
027.114 --Continue, said the abbot, it seems to me that I am listening to the account of a dream. But I myself have seen such extraordinary things, that those you tell me surprise me less.
027.115 --Mercedes at first despaired of the blow which took Edmond from her. I have told you of her entreaties to M. de Villefort and her devotion to Dantes' father. In the midst of her despair a new pain came upon her: the departure of Fernand, of Fernand whose crime she was unaware of, and whom she regarded as her brother.
027.116 "Fernand left, and Mercedes remained alone.
027.117 "Three months passed for her in tears: no news of Edmond, no news of Fernand; nothing before her eyes but an old man who was going away dying of despair.
027.118 "One evening, after sitting all day, as was her habit, at the corner of the two roads that lead from Marseilles to the Catalans, she returned home more despondent than she had been before: neither her lover nor her friend was coming back by either of these two roads, and she had no news of either of them.
027.119 "Suddenly she seemed to hear a familiar step; she turned anxiously, the door opened, and she saw Fernand appear in his second lieutenant's uniform.
027.120 "It was not half of what she was crying for, but it was a portion of her past life that came back to her.
027.121 "Mercedes took hold of Ferdinand's hands with a transport that he took for love, and which was only the joy of not being alone in the world and of seeing a friend again, after long hours of solitary sadness. And then, it must be said, Fernand had never been hated, he was not loved, that's all; another held all the heart of Mercédès, this other was absent... was disappeared... was dead perhaps. At this last idea, Mercedes burst into tears and twisted her arms in pain; but this idea, which she used to reject when it was suggested to her by another, now came back to her mind all by itself; besides, on his side, old Dantes kept telling her: "Our Edmond is dead, for if he were not dead, he would come back to us."
027.122 "The old man died, as I have told you: if he had lived, perhaps Mercedes would never have become the wife of another; for he would have been there to reproach her for her infidelity. Ferdinand understood this. When he knew of the old man's death, he returned. This time he was a lieutenant. On the first trip he had not said a word of love to Mercedes; on the second he reminded her that he loved her.
027.123 "Mercedes asked him for six more months to wait and mourn for Edmond.
027.124 --Actually, said the abbot with a bitter smile, it was eighteen months in all. What more can the most adored lover ask for?"
027.125 Then he murmured the words of the English poet: _Frailty, thy name is woman!_
027.126 "Six months later," Caderousse continued, "the wedding took place in the church of the Accoules.
027.127 -It was the same church where she was to marry Edmond, murmured the priest; only the groom had changed, that's all.
027.128 --Mercedes thus got married, Caderousse continued; but, although in the eyes of all she appeared calm, she did not fail to faint when she passed in front of the Reserve, where eighteen months before had been celebrated her engagement to the one she would have seen she still loved, if she had dared to look into her heart.
027.129 "Fernand, happier, but not more tranquil, for I saw him at that time, and he constantly feared Edmond's return, Fernand immediately set about moving his wife out of the country and going into exile himself; there were too many dangers and too many memories in remaining in the Catalans. Eight days after the wedding they left.
027.130 -- And did you see Mercedes again?
027.131 --Yes, at the time of the Spanish war, in Perpignan, where Fernando had left her; she was then educating her son."
027.132 The abbot shuddered. "Of her son?" he said.
027.133 --Yes, Caderousse answered, of little Albert.
027.134 --But in order to educate this son, continued the abbot, she had been educated herself? It seemed to me that I had heard Edmond say that she was the daughter of a simple fisherman, beautiful, but uneducated.
027.135 --Oh! said Caderousse, did he know his own fiancée so badly! Mercédès could have become queen, sir, if the crown were to rest only on the most beautiful and intelligent heads. Her fortune was already growing, and she was growing with her fortune. She was learning drawing, she was learning music, she was learning everything. Besides, I believe, between us, that she did all this only to distract herself, to forget, and that she put so many things in her head only to fight what she had in her heart. But now all must be said, Caderousse continued: fortune and honors have consoled her without doubt. She is rich, she is a countess, and yet..."
027.136 Caderousse paused.
027.137 "Yet what?" asked the abbot.
027.138 --Dependently, I am sure that she is not happy, said Caderousse.
027.139 --And who makes you think so?
027.140 -- Well, when I found myself too unhappy myself, I thought that my old friends would help me in some way. I went to Danglars, who did not even receive me. I went to Fernand's, who had his valet give me a hundred francs.
027.141 --So you did not see either of them?
027.142 --No; but Mme. de Morcerf saw me.
027.143 --How so?
027.144 --When I went out, a purse fell at my feet, containing twenty-five louis: I looked up quickly and saw Mercedes closing the shutter.
027.145 --And M. de Villefort?
027.146 -- Oh, he had not been my friend; I did not know him; I had nothing to ask him.
027.147 --But do you not know what has become of him, and what part he has taken in Edmond's misfortune?
027.148 -- No, I only know that, some time after having him arrested, he married Mlle. de Saint-Méran, and soon left Marseille. No doubt happiness will have smiled on him as it has on the others, no doubt he is rich like Danglars, considered like Fernand; I alone, you see, have remained poor, miserable and forgotten by God.
027.149 -- "You are mistaken, my friend," said the abbe: "God may seem to forget sometimes, when his justice rests; but there always comes a time when he remembers, and here is the proof."
027.150 At these words the abbe drew the diamond from his pocket, and presenting it to Caderousse:
027.151 "Here, my friend," he said to him, "take this diamond, for it is yours.
027.152 -How can it be mine alone!" cried Caderousse. Ah, sir, are you not mocking?
027.153 --This diamond was to be shared among his friends: Edmond had only one friend, so the sharing is unnecessary. Take this diamond and sell it; it is worth fifty thousand francs, I repeat, and I hope that this sum will be enough to put you out of your misery.
027.154 --Oh, sir," said Caderousse, timidly advancing one hand and wiping with the other the sweat that beaded on his forehead; "oh, sir, do not make a joke of a man's happiness or despair!
027.155 --I know what happiness is and what despair is, and I will never play with feelings for pleasure. Take, then, but in exchange..."
027.156 Caderousse, who had already touched the diamond, withdrew his hand.
027.157 The abbot smiled.
027.158 "In exchange," he continued, "give me this red silk purse which M. Morrel had left on old Dantes' mantelpiece, and which, you told me, is still in your hands."
027.159 Caderousse, more and more astonished, went to a large oak cupboard, opened it, and gave the abbe a long purse, of withered red silk, and around which slipped two once-golden copper rings.
027.160 The abbot took it, and in its place gave the diamond to Caderousse.
027.161 "Oh, you are a man of God, sir!" cried Caderousse, "for in truth no one knew that Edmond had given you that diamond, and you could have kept it.
027.162 -Well, said the abbe to himself, you would have done it, it seems, you."
027.163 The abbot got up, took his hat and gloves.
027.164 "Oh," he said, "everything you have told me is true, isn't it, and I can believe it in every way?
027.165 -Here, Monsieur l'abbé, says Caderousse, in the corner of this wall is a blessed wooden Christ; here on this sideboard is my wife's book of gospels: open this book, and I will swear to you on it, with my hand stretched out towards Christ, I will swear to you on the salvation of my soul, on my faith as a Christian, that I have told you all things as they happened, and as the angel of men will say in the ear of God on the day of the Last Judgment!
027.166 - "That's good," said the abbot, convinced by this accent that Caderousse was telling the truth, "that's good; may this money benefit you! Farewell, I return far from the men who do so much harm to one another."
027.167 And the abbe, delivering himself with great difficulty from Caderousse's enthusiastic outbursts, raised the bar of the door himself, went out, remounted his horse, saluted the innkeeper one last time, who was confounded in noisy farewells, and left, following the same direction he had already followed to come.
027.168 When Caderousse turned around, he saw Carconte behind him, paler and more trembling than ever.
027.169 "Is it true what I heard?
027.170 --What? That he was giving us the diamond all to ourselves?" said Caderousse, almost mad with joy.
027.171 --Yes.
027.172 -- Nothing could be truer, for here it is."
027.173 The woman looked at him for a moment; then, in a dull voice:
027.174 "What if it were false?" she said.
027.175 Caderousse paled and staggered.
027.176 "False," he murmured, "false... and why would this man give me a false diamond?
027.177 --To get your secret without paying for it, you fool!"
027.178 Caderousse remained for a moment dizzy under the weight of this supposition.
027.179 "Oh!" he said after a moment, and taking up his hat, which he placed on the red handkerchief tied around his head, "we'll find out.
027.180 --And how?
027.181 -It is the fair in Beaucaire; there are jewelers from Paris: I will go and show it to them. You keep the house, woman; in two hours I shall be back."
027.182 And Caderousse dashed out of the house, and ran the opposite way from that which the stranger had just taken.
027.183 "Fifty thousand francs!" murmured Carconte, left alone, "that's money... but it's not a fortune."
028.000 The prison records.
028.001 The day after the scene we have just recounted took place on the road from Bellegarde to Beaucaire, a man between thirty and thirty-two years of age, dressed in a bearded blue frac, nankin pants and a white vest, with both a British look and accent, presented himself at the home of the mayor of Marseille.
028.002 "Sir," he said, "I am the first clerk of the Thomson and French company in Rome. For ten years we have been in contact with the firm of Morrel et fils of Marseille. We have about a hundred thousand francs involved in these relations, and we are not without worries, since it is said that the house is in danger of ruin: I have therefore come all the way from Rome to ask you for information about this house.
028.003 --Sir, answered the mayor, I know indeed that for four or five years misfortune seems to pursue Mr. Morrel: he successively lost four or five buildings, underwent three or four bankruptcies; but it does not belong to me, although his creditor myself for about ten thousand francs, to give any information on the state of his fortune. Ask me as mayor what I think of Mr. Morrel, and I will answer you that he is a man who is honest to the point of rigidity, and who up to now has fulfilled all his commitments with perfect accuracy. That is all I can tell you, sir; if you wish to know more, address yourself to M. de Boville, inspector of prisons, rue de Noailles, No. 15; he has, I believe, two hundred thousand francs placed in the Morrel house, and if there is really anything to fear, as this sum is more considerable than mine, you will probably find him better informed on this point than I am."
028.004 The Englishman seemed to appreciate this supreme delicacy, saluted, went out, and walked with that step peculiar to the sons of Great Britain to the street indicated.
028.005 M. de Boville was in his office. On seeing him, the Englishman made a movement of surprise which seemed to indicate that it was not the first time that he had found himself in front of the person to whom he had come to make a visit. As for M. de Boville, he was so desperate, that it was evident that all the faculties of his mind, absorbed in the thought which occupied him at the moment, left neither his memory nor his imagination the leisure to wander into the past.
028.006 The Englishman, with the phlegm of his nation, asked him in much the same terms the same question he had just asked the mayor of Marseilles.
028.007 "Oh, sir," cried M. de Boville, "your fears are unfortunately well founded, and you see a desperate man. I had two hundred thousand francs invested in the Morrel house: these two hundred thousand francs were the dowry of my daughter whom I intended to marry in a fortnight; these two hundred thousand francs were repayable, one hundred thousand on the 15th of this month, one hundred thousand on the 15th of next month. I had given notice to Mr. Morrel of my desire that this repayment be made exactly, and now he has come here, sir, barely half an hour ago, to tell me that if his ship the _Pharaon_ had not returned by the 15th, he would be unable to make this payment to me.
028.008 --But, said the Englishman, this sounds like a delay.
028.009 --Sir, that sounds like bankruptcy!" cried M. de Boville in despair.
028.010 The Englishman seemed to think for a moment, then said:
028.011 "So, sir, you are afraid of this claim?
028.012 --That is, I consider it lost.
028.013 --Well, I'll buy it from you.
028.014 --You?
028.015 -- Yes, I do.
028.016 --But at a huge discount, no doubt?
028.017 -- No, for two hundred thousand francs; our house," added the Englishman, laughing, "doesn't do these kinds of deals.
028.018 --And you pay?
028.019 --Counting."
028.020 And the Englishman drew from his pocket a bundle of banknotes which could be twice the sum which M. de Boville feared to lose. A flash of joy passed over the face of M. de Boville; but nevertheless he made an effort upon himself and said:
028.021 "Sir, I must warn you that, in all probability, you will not have six of the hundred of this sum.
028.022 "That is not my business," replied the Englishman; "it is the business of Thomson and French, in whose name I act. Perhaps it is in their interest to hasten the ruin of a rival firm. But what I know, sir, is that I am ready to count this sum against the transport that you will make me; only I will ask for a brokerage fee.
028.023 -How, sir, that is too fair! The commission is usually one and a half: do you want two? do you want three? do you want five? do you want more, finally? Speak?
028.024 - "Sir," said the Englishman, laughing, "I am like my house, I do not do these kinds of business; no: my brokerage right is of a completely different nature.
028.025 --Speak up, sir, I am listening.
028.026 --You are an inspector of prisons?
028.027 --For over fourteen years.
028.028 --You keep records of entries and exits?
028.029 --Surely.
028.030 --To these registers must be attached notes concerning the prisoners?
028.031 --Every prisoner has a file.
028.032 -- Well, sir, I was brought up in Rome by a poor devil of an abbot who suddenly disappeared. I have since learned that he was detained in the Château d'If, and I would like to have some details about his death.
028.033 -How did you name him?
028.034 --Abbot Faria.
028.035 --Oh, I remember him perfectly!" cried M. de Boville, "he was mad.
028.036 --They said so.
028.037 --Oh, he certainly was.
028.038 --It is possible; and what was his kind of madness?
028.039 -- He claimed to have knowledge of an immense treasure, and offered crazy sums to the government if they would release him.
028.040 --Poor devil! And he died?
028.041 -- Yes, sir, about five or six months ago, last February.
028.042 --You have a good memory, sir, for remembering dates like that.
028.043 --I remember this one, because the death of the poor devil was accompanied by a singular circumstance.
028.044 --Can we know what that circumstance was? asked the Englishman with an expression of curiosity that a profound observer would have been surprised to find on his phlegmatic face.
028.045 --Oh, my God! yes, sir: the abbot's dungeon was about forty-five to fifty feet from that of a former Bonapartist agent, one of those who had contributed most to the return of the usurper in 1815, a very resolute and dangerous man.
028.046 -- Really? said the Englishman.
028.047 --Yes, replied M. de Boville; I had occasion myself to see this man in 1816 or 1817, and one only went down to his dungeon with a piquet of soldiers: this man made a deep impression on me, and I shall never forget his face."
028.048 The Englishman smiled imperceptibly.
028.049 "And so you say, sir," he continued, "that the two dungeons....
028.050 --Were separated by a distance of fifty feet; but it seems that this Edmond Dantes....
028.051 --This dangerous man was called ....
028.052 --Edmond Dantes. Yes, sir; it seems that this Edmond Dantes had procured tools or had made some, for a corridor was found by means of which the prisoners communicated.
028.053 --This corridor had undoubtedly been made for the purpose of escape?
028.054 -- Exactly; but unfortunately for the prisoners, Father Faria suffered a cataleptic attack and died.
028.055 --I understand; that must have stopped the escape plans short.
028.056 --For the dead, yes, replied M. de Boville, but not for the living; on the contrary, this Dantes saw in it a means of hastening his escape; he thought, no doubt, that the prisoners who died in the Château d'If were buried in an ordinary cemetery; he carried the dead man to his room, took his place in the bag in which he had been sewn, and waited for the moment of burial.
028.057 --That was a risky way to go about it, and one that showed some courage," said the Englishman.
028.058 --Oh, I told you, sir, that he was a very dangerous man; fortunately he himself relieved the government of the fears it had about him.
028.059 --How so?
028.060 --How? Don't you understand?
028.061 --No.
028.062 --The Castle of Yew has no cemetery; the dead are simply thrown into the sea, after having tied a thirty-six ball to their feet.
028.063 --Well?" said the Englishman, as if he had a difficult conception.
028.064 -- Well, they tied a thirty-six ball to his feet and threw him into the sea.
028.065 -- Really?" exclaimed the Englishman.
028.066 -- Yes, sir," continued the inspector. You can understand how astonished the fugitive must have been when he felt himself hurled from the top to the bottom of the rocks. I would have liked to see his face at that moment.
028.067 -- That would have been difficult.
028.068 --Never mind!" said M. de Boville, whom the certainty of getting back his two hundred thousand francs put in a good mood, "I can picture her.
028.069 And he burst into laughter.
028.070 "And so am I," said the Englishman.
028.071 And he began to laugh on his side, but as the English laugh, that is, with the tip of his teeth.
028.072 "So," continued the Englishman, who first regained his composure, "so the fugitive was drowned?
028.073 --All right.
028.074 --So that the governor of the castle was rid of both the madman and the madman?
028.075 --But some sort of record must have been made of this event? asked the Englishman.
028.076 -- Yes, yes, a death certificate. You understand that Dantes' relatives, if he had any, might have had an interest in ascertaining whether he was dead or alive.
028.077 --So now they can rest easy if they inherit him. Is he dead and well dead?
028.078 -- Oh, my God, yes. And they will be given a certificate when they want it.
028.079 -- So be it, said the Englishman. But let's get back to the registers.
028.080 --That's right. This story had taken us away from them. I'm sorry.
028.081 --Sorry about what? The story? Not at all, she seemed curious to me.
028.082 --It is indeed curious. So, you wish to see, sir, all that relates to your poor abbot, who was indeed the very sweetness of life?
028.083 --It will please me.
028.084 --Pass into my study and I will show you this."
028.085 And both passed into the cabinet of M. de Boville. Everything there was indeed in perfect order: each register was at its number, each file at its box. The inspector seated the Englishman in his chair, and placed before him the register and the file relating to the Château d'If, giving him all the time in the world to leaf through them, while he himself, sitting in a corner, read his newspaper.
028.086 The Englishman easily found the file relating to the Abbé Faria; but it seems that the story told to him by M. de Boville had interested him greatly, for after having acquainted himself with these first pieces, he continued to leaf through them until he had reached the Edmond Dantes bundle. There he found everything in its place: denunciation, interrogation, Morrel's petition, M. de Villefort's apostille. He gently folded the denunciation, put it in his pocket, read the interrogation, and seeing that Noirtier's name was not mentioned in it, went through the petition dated April 10, 1815, in which Morrel, according to the advice of the prosecutor, exaggerated with an excellent intention, since Napoleon was then reigning, the services that Dantes had rendered to the imperial cause, services that Villefort's certificate rendered incontestable. Then he understood everything. This request to Napoleon, kept by Villefort, had become under the second Restoration a terrible weapon in the hands of the king's prosecutor. He was no longer surprised, therefore, when he leafed through the register, at this note placed in braces opposite his name:
028.087 _Edmond Dantès: Enraged Bonapartist: took an active part in the return from Elba_. To be kept in the greatest secrecy and under the strictest surveillance.
028.088 Below these lines was written in another handwriting:
028.089 "In view of the above note, _nothing to do_."
028.090 Only by comparing the handwriting of the brace with that of the certificate placed at the bottom of Morrel's application did he acquire the certainty that the note in the brace was in the same handwriting as the certificate, that is, drawn by Villefort's hand.
028.091 As for the note that accompanied the note, the Englishman understood that it must have been written down by some inspector who had taken a passing interest in Dantes' situation, but whom the information we have just quoted had made it impossible to follow up on that interest.
028.092 As we have said, the inspector, out of discretion and in order not to hinder the pupil of Abbé Faria in his research, had gone away and was reading _Le Drapeau blanc_.
028.093 So he did not see the Englishman fold and put in his pocket the denunciation written by Danglars under the arbour of the Reserve, and bearing the stamp of the Marseilles post office, February 27, 6 o'clock in the evening.
028.094 But, it must be said, he would have seen that he attached too little importance to this paper and too much importance to his two hundred thousand francs, to object to what the Englishman was doing, however incorrectly.
028.095 "Thank you," said the latter, noisily closing the register. I have what I need; now it is my turn to keep my promise: make me a simple transport of your claim; acknowledge in this transport that you have received the amount, and I will count the sum."
028.096 And he gave up his place at the desk to M. de Boville, who sat down casually and hastened to make the requested conveyance, while the Englishman counted the banknotes on the edge of the case.
029.000 The Morrel house.
029.001 Whoever had left Marseilles a few years before, knowing the interior of the Morrel house, and had entered it at the time we have reached, would have found a great change there.
029.002 Instead of that air of life, ease and happiness which exhales, so to speak, from a house in the process of prosperity; instead of those joyful figures showing themselves behind the curtains of the windows, of those busy clerks crossing the corridors, a feather stuck behind their ears; instead of that courtyard cluttered with bundles, resounding with the cries and laughter of the letter carriers; he would have found, from the first sight, something sad and dead. In this deserted corridor and in this empty courtyard, of the many employees who formerly populated the offices, only two had remained: one was a young man of twenty-three or twenty-four years, named Emmanuel Raymond, who was in love with the daughter of M. Morrel, and had remained in the office. One was a young man of twenty-three or twenty-four, named Emmanuel Raymond, who was in love with the daughter of Mr. Morrel, and had remained in the house whatever his parents could have done to remove him; the other was an old, one-eyed cashier's boy, named Coclès, a nickname given to him by the young people who once populated this great buzzing hive, now almost uninhabited, and which had so well and so completely replaced his real name, that, in all probability, he would not have even turned around, if he had been called by that name today
029.003 Coclès had remained in the service of M. Morrel, and a singular change had taken place in the situation of the good man. He had at the same time risen to the rank of cashier, and descended to the rank of servant.
029.004 He was still the same Coclès, good, patient, devoted, but inflexible in arithmetic, the only point on which he had stood up to the whole world, even to Mr. Morrel, and knowing only his Pythagoras table, which he knew at the tip of his finger, no matter how one turned it over and no matter what mistake one tried to make him fall into.
029.005 In the middle of the general sadness which had invaded the Morrel house, Coclès was besides the only one who had remained impassive. But, that one is not mistaken there; this impassibility did not come from a defect of affection, but on the contrary of an unshakeable conviction. Like the rats, which, it is said, gradually leave a ship condemned in advance by fate to perish at sea, so that these selfish hosts have completely abandoned it by the time it weighs anchor, so, as we have said, the whole crowd of clerks and employees who drew their livelihood from the shipowner's house had gradually deserted the office and the store; and Cocles had seen them all leave without even thinking of realizing the cause of their departure; Everything, as we have said, was reduced for Coclès to a question of figures, and for the twenty years that he had been in the Morrel company, he had always seen the payments take place in open offices with such regularity, that he no more admitted that this regularity could stop and these payments be suspended, than a miller who possesses a mill fed by the waters of a rich river admits that this river could cease to flow. Indeed, until then, nothing had come to undermine the conviction of Coclès. The last end of the month had been carried out with rigorous punctuality. Coclès had noted an error of seventy centimes made by Mr. Morrel to his prejudice, and the same day he had brought the fourteen cents of excess back to Mr. Morrel, who, with a melancholy smile, had taken them and dropped them in a drawer that was almost empty, saying:
029.006 "Well, Coclès, you are the pearl of cashiers."
029.007 And Coclès had withdrawn one could not be more satisfied; for a praise of M. Morrel, this pearl of the honest people of Marseilles, flattered Coclès more than a gratification of fifty écus.
029.008 But since this end of month so victoriously accomplished, M. Morrel had passed cruel hours; to face this end of month, he had gathered all his resources, and himself, fearing that the noise of his distress would spread in Marseilles, when one would see him resorting to such extremities, had made a trip to the fair of Beaucaire to sell some jewels belonging to his wife and his daughter, and a part of his silverware. In return for this sacrifice, everything had once again been done to the great honor of the Morrel house; but the treasury had remained completely empty. The credit, frightened by the rumor, had withdrawn with its usual selfishness; and to meet the hundred thousand francs to be repaid on the 15th of the present month to M. de Boville, and the other hundred thousand francs which were to fall due on the 15th of the following month, M. Morrel had in reality only the hope of the return of the _Pharaon_, of which a vessel which had weighed anchor at the same time as he, and which had arrived at the port, had learned of the departure.
029.009 But this ship, coming, like the _Pharaon_ from Calcutta, had already arrived a fortnight ago, while there was no news of the _Pharaon_.
029.010 It was in this state of affairs that, the day after he had completed with M. de Boville the important affair we have mentioned, the envoy of Thomson and French from Rome presented himself to M. Morrel.
029.011 Emmanuel received him. The young man, whom every new face frightened, for every new face announced a new creditor, who, in his anxiety, came to question the head of the house, the young man, we say, wanted to spare his boss the trouble of this visit: he questioned the newcomer; but the newcomer declared that he had nothing to say to Mr. Emmanuel, and that it was to Mr. Morrel himself that he wanted to speak. Emmanuel called Coclès with a sigh. Coclès appeared, and the young man ordered him to take the stranger to Mr. Morrel.
029.012 Coclès went ahead, and the stranger followed him.
029.013 On the staircase, one met a beautiful young girl of sixteen to seventeen years, who looked at the stranger with concern.
029.014 Coclès did not notice this expression of face which however seemed not to have escaped the stranger.
029.015 "Mr. Morrel is in his office, isn't he, Miss Julie?" asked the cashier.
029.016 --Yes, at least I think so," said the young girl, hesitating; "see first, Coclès, and if my father is there, announce him.
029.017 -To announce me would be useless, mademoiselle, replied the Englishman, M. Morrel does not know my name. This good man has only to say, that I am the first clerk of Messrs. Thomson and French, of Rome, with whom the house of your father is in connection."
029.018 The girl paled and continued to descend, while Coclès and the stranger continued to ascend.
029.019 She entered the office where Emmanuel was standing, and Coclès, with the aid of a key of which he was the possessor, and which announced his great entrances near the master, opened a door placed in the corner of the landing of the second floor, introduced the stranger into an anteroom, opened a second door which he closed behind him, and, after leaving the envoy of the house of Thomson and French alone for a moment, reappeared, signalling to him that he might enter.
029.020 The Englishman entered; he found Mr. Morrel seated in front of a table, paling before the frightening columns of the register in which his liabilities were inscribed.
029.021 Seeing the stranger, Mr. Morrel closed the register, stood up and moved a seat forward; then, when he had seen the stranger sit down, he sat down himself.
029.022 Fourteen years had changed the worthy merchant, who, aged thirty-six at the beginning of this story, was about to reach fifty: his hair had turned white, his forehead had deepened under worried wrinkles; finally his gaze, once so firm and fixed, had become vague and irresolute, and seemed always to fear being forced to stop either on an idea or on a man.
029.023 The Englishman looked at him with a feeling of curiosity evidently mixed with interest.
029.024 "Sir," said Morrel, whose uneasiness this examination seemed to redouble, "you wished to speak to me?
029.025 --Yes, sir. You know where I come from, don't you?
029.026 --From Thomson and French, at least as my cashier told me.
029.027 -- He told you the truth, sir. The Thomson and French house had in the course of this month and the next three or four hundred thousand francs to pay in France, and knowing your rigorous accuracy, they gathered all the paper they could find bearing this signature, and charged me, as and when these papers fell due, to collect the funds from you and to make use of these funds."
029.028 Morrel heaved a deep sigh, and passed his hand over his sweaty forehead.
029.029 "So, sir," asked Morrel, "you have drafts signed by me?
029.030 --Yes, sir, for a rather considerable sum.
029.031 --For what sum?" asked Morrel in a voice that he tried to make confident.
029.032 --But first of all, said the Englishman, drawing a bundle from his pocket, a transport of two hundred thousand francs made to our house by M. de Boville, the inspector of prisons. Do you acknowledge that you owe this sum to M. de Boville?
029.033 --Yes, sir, it is an investment he made with me, at four and a half cents, nearly five years ago.
029.034 --And that you must repay....
029.035 --Half on the 15th of this month, half on the 15th of next month.
029.036 --That's right; then here are thirty-two thousand five hundred francs, current end: they are drafts signed by you and made out to our order by third party bearers.
029.037 --I recognize it, said Morrel, to whom the red of shame rose to his face, thinking that for the first time in his life he could not perhaps honor his signature; is that all?
029.038 --No, sir, I still have for the end of next month these values, which the house of Pascal and the house of Wild and Turner of Marseilles have passed to us, fifty-five thousand francs about: in all two hundred and eighty-seven thousand five hundred francs."
029.039 What the unfortunate Morrel suffered during this enumeration is impossible to describe.
029.040 "Two hundred and eighty-seven thousand five hundred francs," he repeated mechanically.
029.041 --Yes, sir," replied the Englishman. Now," he continued after a moment's silence, "I will not conceal from you, Mr. Morrel, that, while you have made good your unimpeachable probity up to the present, the public rumor in Marseilles is that you are in no condition to meet your affairs."
029.042 At this almost brutal overture, Morrel paled horribly.
029.043 "Sir," he said, "up to the present, and it is more than twenty-four years since I received the house from the hands of my father, who himself had managed it thirty-five years, up to the present not a bill signed Morrel and son has been presented at the cashier's office without being paid.
029.044 --Yes, I know that," replied the Englishman; "but man of honor to man of honor, speak frankly. Sir, will you pay these with the same exactness?"
029.045 Morrel flinched and looked at the man who spoke to him in this way with more assurance than he had yet given him.
029.046 "To questions asked with this frankness," he said, "one must make a frank answer. Yes, sir, I will pay if, as I hope, my ship arrives safely, for its arrival will restore to me the credit which the successive accidents of which I have been the victim have taken away; but if by misfortune the _Pharaon_, that last resource on which I rely, should fail me..."
029.047 Tears came to the eyes of the poor shipowner.
029.048 "Well," asked his interlocutor, "if this last resource were to fail you...
029.049 -- Well, Morrel continued, sir, it is cruel to say... but, already accustomed to misfortune, I must get used to shame, well, I think I would be forced to suspend my payments.
029.050 -- Have you no friends who can help you in this circumstance?"
029.051 Morrel smiled sadly.
029.052 "In business, sir," he said, "one has no friends, you know that well, one has only correspondents.
029.053 --That's true," murmured the Englishman. So you have only one hope left?
029.054 -Only one.
029.055 -The last one?
029.056 --The last one.
029.057 --So that if you miss this hope ....
029.058 --I am lost, sir, completely lost.
029.059 --As I was coming to your house, a ship was entering the port.
029.060 --I know that, sir. A young man who has remained faithful to my bad fortune spends part of his time at a lookout on top of the house, hoping to come and tell me good news first. I knew through him the entrance of this ship.
029.061 --And it is not yours?
029.062 -- No, it is a ship from Bordeaux, the _Gironde_; it comes from India too, but it is not mine.
029.063 --Perhaps he has had knowledge of the _Pharaon_ and is bringing you some news.
029.064 --Do I have to tell you, sir? I am almost as afraid of hearing news of my three-masted ship as I am of remaining in uncertainty. Uncertainty is still hope."
029.065 Then Mr. Morrel added in a dull voice:
029.066 "This delay is not natural; the _Pharaon_ left Calcutta on the 5th of February: for more than a month she should have been here.
029.067 --What is this," said the Englishman, lending an ear, "and what does this noise mean?
029.068 -- O my God! my God!" cried Morrel, turning pale, "what is it now?
029.069 Indeed, there was a great noise on the staircase; people were coming and going, and even a cry of pain was heard.
029.070 Morrel got up to open the door, but his strength failed him and he fell back into his chair.
029.071 The two men stood facing each other, Morrel trembling with all his limbs, the stranger looking at him with an expression of deep pity. The noise had ceased; but nevertheless it seemed as if Morrel was waiting for something; this noise had a cause and must have a continuation.
029.072 It seemed to the stranger that the stairs were being slowly ascended and that the footsteps of several people were stopping on the landing.
029.073 A key was inserted in the lock of the first door, and that door was heard shouting on its bottom.
029.074 "There are only two people who have the key to this door," murmured Morrel, "Coclès and Julie."
029.075 At the same time the second door opened and the pale girl appeared with her cheeks bathed in tears.
029.076 Morrel rose trembling, and leaned on the arm of his chair, for he could not have stood. His voice wanted to question, but he had no voice.
029.077 "O my father!" said the girl, clasping her hands, "forgive your child for being the messenger of bad news!"
029.078 Morrel paled horribly; Julie came and threw herself into his arms.
029.079 "O my father! my father!" she said, "take courage!
029.080 --And so the _Pharaoh_ has perished?" asked Morrel in a choked voice.
029.081 The girl did not answer, but she made an affirmative sign with her head, leaning on her father's chest.
029.082 "And the crew?" asked Morrel.
029.083 --Saved, said the girl, saved by the Bordeaux ship that has just entered the harbor."
029.084 Morrel raised both hands to heaven with an expression of resignation and sublime gratitude.
029.085 "Thank you, my God!" said Morrel; "at least you strike only me alone."
029.086 Phlegmatic as the Englishman was, a tear moistened his eyelid.
029.087 "Come in," said Morrel, "come in, for I presume you are all at the door."
029.088 Indeed, scarcely had he uttered these words, when Mrs. Morrel entered, sobbing; Emmanuel followed her; at the back, in the anteroom, were the rugged figures of seven or eight half-naked sailors. At the sight of these men, the Englishman flinched; he took a step as if to go to them, but he restrained himself and faded away into the farthest and darkest corner of the cabinet.
029.089 Mrs. Morrel went and sat down in the armchair, took one of her husband's hands in hers, while Julie remained leaning against her father's chest. Emmanuel had remained halfway across the room and seemed to serve as a link between the Morrel family group and the sailors standing at the door.
029.090 "How did this happen?" asked Morrel.
029.091 --Come along, Penelon," said the young man, "and tell the event."
029.092 An old sailor, tanned by the sun of the equator, came forward rolling the remains of a hat in his hands.
029.093 "Good morning, Mr. Morrel," he said, as if he had left Marseilles the day before and had arrived from Aix or Toulon.
029.094 --Hello, my friend," said the shipowner, unable to help smiling through his tears: "but where is the captain?
029.095 -- As for the captain, Mr. Morrel, he remained ill in Palma; but, please God, that will be nothing, and you will see him arrive in a few days as well as you and I.
029.096 -That's fine... now speak, Penelon," said Mr. Morrel.
029.097 Penelon passed his cheek from his right to his left, put his hand in front of his mouth, turned away, threw a long jet of blackish saliva into the antechamber, moved his foot forward, and swayed on his hips:
029.098 "For then, Mr. Morrel," he said, "we were something like this between Cape Blanc and Cape Boyador walking with a nice south-southwest breeze, after having sailed for eight days of calm, when Captain Gaumard came up to me, I must tell you that I was at the helm, and said to me: 'Father Penelon, what do you think of those clouds that are rising over there on the horizon?"
029.099 "I was looking at them at that very moment.
029.100 "-What I think of them, Captain! I think that they are rising a little faster than they have the right to do, and that they are blacker than is appropriate for clouds that have no bad intentions.
029.101 "-That's my opinion too," said the captain, "and I'll always take my precautions. We have too many sails for the wind we are going to have just now.... Hola! hey! put away to tighten the cacatois and to haul low of clinfoc!
029.102 "It was time; the order was not carried out, that the wind was at our heels and that the building gave of the band.
029.103 "-Good!" said the captain, "we still have too much canvas, set the main sail!
029.104 "Five minutes later, the main sail was set and we were sailing with the foresail, topsails and parrots.
029.105 "--Well, Father Penelon," said the captain, "what are you shaking your head at?
029.106 "--I have that in your place, you see, I would not stay on such a beautiful path.
029.107 "--I think you are right, old man," he said, "we are going to have a gale.
029.108 "--Ah, for example, Captain," I replied, "whoever buys what is going on out there for a gale would gain something on it; it is a fine, good storm, or I don't know anything about it!
029.109 "That is to say, one could see the wind coming as one sees the dust coming in Montredon; fortunately he was dealing with a man who knew him.
029.110 "--Reefine to take two reefs in the topsails!" shouted the captain; "cast off the bolts, beat to windward, bring up the topsails, weigh the staysails on the yards!
029.111 --That was not enough in those parts, said the Englishman; I would have taken four reefs and got rid of the foresail."
029.112 This firm voice, sonorous and unexpected, made everyone flinch. Penelon put his hand over his eyes and looked at the man who controlled his captain's maneuvering with such aplomb.
029.113 "We did better than that, sir," said the old sailor with a certain respect, "for we cargued the brigantine and put the helm to windward to run before the storm. Ten minutes later, we hauled in the topsails and left with no sails.
029.114 --The ship was very old to risk this, said the Englishman.
029.115 -- Well, that's exactly what got us lost. After twelve hours that we were tossed about as the devil would have taken arms, a leak occurred. "Penelon," said the captain to me, "I think we are sinking, old man; so give me the helm and go down to the hold."
029.116 "I gave him the helm, went down; there was already three feet of water. I go back up shouting: "To the pumps! To the pumps!" Oh yes, it was already too late! We got to work; but I think that the more we pulled, the more there was.
029.117 "--Ah, my goodness," I said after four hours of work, "since we are sinking, let us sink, we only die once!
029.118 "-Is that how you set an example, Master Penelon?" said the captain; "well, wait, wait! "He went to his cabin and took a pair of pistols.
029.119 "-The first one who leaves the pump," he said, "I'll blow his brains out!
029.120 --Good, said the Englishman.
029.121 --There is nothing that gives courage like good reasons, continued the sailor, especially since during that time the weather had cleared up and the wind had dropped; but it is no less true that the water was still rising, not by much, perhaps by two inches an hour, but at last it was rising. Two inches an hour, you see, doesn't sound like much; but in twelve hours that's not less than twenty-four inches, and twenty-four inches is two feet. Two feet and three we already had, that makes five. Now, when a ship has five feet of water in its belly, it can pass for hydropic.
I am not going to say that I am not going to be able to do anything about it, but I am going to do something about it, and I am not going to say that I am not going to do anything about it. We have done what we could to save the ship; now we must try to save the men. To the boat, children, and faster than that!
029.123 "Listen, Monsieur Morrel," continued Penelon, "we liked the _Pharaon_ well, but as much as the sailor loves his ship, he loves his skin even better. So we were not told twice; with that, you see, the ship complained and seemed to say to us: "Go away, but go away! And he wasn't lying, poor _Pharaon_, we could literally feel him sinking under our feet. So much so that in a trice the boat was in the sea, and all eight of us were in it.
029.124 "The captain went down last, or rather, no, he did not go down, for he did not want to leave the ship, it was I who took him by the arm and threw him to the comrades, after which I jumped in my turn. It was time. As I jumped, the deck burst with a noise that sounded like the planking of a ship of forty-eight.
029.125 "Ten minutes later, she plunged forward, then backward, then turned on herself like a dog chasing its tail; and then, good night company, brrou!... all has been said, no more _Pharaon_!
029.126 "As for us, we remained three days without eating or drinking; so much so that we were talking about drawing lots to see who would feed the others, when we saw the _Gironde_: we signaled to her, she saw us, set a course for us, sent her boat to us and took us in. That is how it happened, Mr. Morrel, word of honor! faith of a sailor! Isn't that so, the others?"
029.127 A general murmur of approval indicated that the narrator had gathered all the suffrages by the truth of the background and the picturesqueness of the details.
029.128 "Well, my friends," said M. Morrel, "you are good people, and I knew beforehand that in the misfortune that befell me there was no other culprit than my destiny. It is the will of God and not the fault of men. Let us adore the will of God. Now how much pay is due to you?
029.129 --Oh, let's not talk about that, Mr. Morrel.
029.130 -- On the contrary, let's talk about it, said the shipowner with a sad smile.
029.131 --Well, they owe us three months... said Penelon.
029.132 --Cocles, pay two hundred francs to each of these good people. In another time, my friends," continued Morrel, "I would have added: 'Give them each two hundred francs of gratuity'; but times are unhappy, my friends, and the little money I have left no longer belongs to me. Excuse me, therefore, and love me no less for it."
029.133 Penelon made a grimace of tenderness, turned back to his companions, exchanged a few words with them, and returned.
029.134 "As for that, Mr. Morrel," he said, passing his chew on the other side of his mouth and throwing into the anteroom a second jet of saliva that went to match the first, "as for that....
029.135 --What?
029.136 --Money....
029.137 --Well?
029.138 --Well, Mr. Morrel, the comrades say that for the moment they will have enough with fifty francs each and that they will wait for the rest.
029.139 --Thank you, my friends, thank you!" cried M. Morrel, touched to the heart: you are all good hearts; but take, take, and if you find a good service, enter it, you are free."
029.140 This last part of the sentence produced a prodigious effect on the worthy sailors. They looked at each other with a frightened expression. Penelon, whose breath failed him, almost swallowed his chew; fortunately, he put his hand to his throat in time.
029.141 "How, Mr. Morrel," he said in a strangled voice, "how, you are sending us away! are you therefore dissatisfied with us?
029.142 -- No, my children," said the shipowner; "no, I am not dissatisfied with you, on the contrary. No, I am not sending you away. But what do you want? I have no more ships, I have no more need of sailors.
029.143 -How can you have no more ships! Well, you will have others built, we will wait. Thank God, we know what it is to sail.
029.144 --I have no more money to build ships, Penelon, said the shipowner with a sad smile, so I cannot accept your offer, however kind it may be.
029.145 -- Well, if you have no money, you must not pay us; then we will do as poor Pharaoh did, we will run dry, that's all!
029.146 - "Enough, enough, my friends," said Morrel, choking with emotion; "go, I pray you. We shall meet again in better weather. Emmanuel," added the shipowner, "go with them, and see that my wishes are fulfilled.
029.147 --At least it is good-bye, isn't it, Mr. Morrel? said Penelon.
029.148 --Yes, my friends, I hope so, at least; go."
029.149 And he made a sign to Coclès, who walked ahead. The sailors followed the cashier, and Emmanuel followed the sailors.
029.150 "Now," said the shipowner to his wife and daughter, "leave me alone for a moment; I have to talk with monsieur."
029.151 And he indicated with his eyes the agent of the house of Thomson and French, who had remained standing motionless in his corner during the whole scene, in which he had taken part only by the few words we have reported. The two women looked up at the stranger, whom they had completely forgotten, and withdrew; but, as they withdrew, the girl gave the man a sublime look of supplication, to which he replied with a smile that a cold observer would have been astonished to see blossom on that icy face. The two men remained alone.
029.152 "Well, sir," said Morrel, dropping back into his chair, "you have seen and heard everything, and I have nothing more to teach you.
029.153 -- "I have seen, sir," said the Englishman, "that a new and undeserved misfortune has befallen you, like the others, and this has confirmed me in my desire to be agreeable to you.
029.154 -- Oh sir!" said Morrel.
029.155 -- Let us see," continued the stranger. I am one of your principal creditors, am I not?
029.156 -- You are at least the one with the shortest maturity.
029.157 -- Do you want a delay in paying me?
029.158 --A delay could save my honor, and therefore my life.
029.159 --How much do you want?"
029.160 Morrel hesitated.
029.161 "Two months," he said.
029.162 --Well, said the stranger, I'll give you three.
029.163 --But do you believe that the Thomson and French house....
029.164 --Do not worry, sir, I'll take it all on myself. Today is the 5th of June.
029.165 --Yes.
029.166 --Well, renew all these bills to me on September 5; and on September 5, at eleven o'clock in the morning (the clock marked eleven o'clock just then), I will present myself at your house.
029.167 --I will wait for you, sir," said Morrel, "and you will be paid or I will be dead."
029.168 These last words were pronounced so low, that the stranger could not hear them.
029.169 The bills were renewed, the old ones were torn up, and the poor shipowner found himself at least three months ahead of him to gather his last resources.
029.170 The Englishman received his thanks with the phlegm peculiar to his nation, and took leave of Morrel, who led him back to the door with a blessing.
029.171 On the stairs he met Julie. The girl pretended to come down, but in reality she was waiting for him.
029.172 "Oh sir!" she said, joining her hands.
029.173 "Miss," said the stranger, "one day you will receive a letter signed .... Simbad the sailor.... Do from point to point what this letter will tell you, however strange the recommendation may seem to you.
029.174 --Yes, sir," replied Julie.
029.175 -Do you promise to do so?
029.176 -- I swear to you.
029.177 --Good! Farewell, Miss. Remain always a good and holy girl as you are, and I have great hope that God will reward you by giving you Emmanuel for a husband."
029.178 Julie gave a little cry, turned red as a cherry, and held onto the railing so as not to fall.
029.179 The stranger continued on his way, waving goodbye to her. In the courtyard he met Penelon, who was holding a roll of a hundred francs in each hand, and seemed unable to bring himself to take them.
029.180 "Come, my friend," he said to him, "I have to talk to you."
030.000 The fifth of September.
030.001 This delay granted by the agent of Thomson and French, at the moment when Morrel least expected it, seemed to the poor shipowner one of those returns of happiness which announce to a man that fate has finally tired of being hard on him. That same day, he told his daughter, his wife and Emmanuel what had happened to him, and a little hope, if not tranquility, returned to the family. But unfortunately, Morrel had to deal not only with Thomson and French, who had been so good to him. As he had said, in business one has correspondents and no friends. When he thought deeply, he did not even understand this generous conduct of Messrs. Thomson and French towards him; he could only explain it to himself by this cleverly selfish reflection that this house would have made: Better to support a man who owes us nearly three hundred thousand francs, and to have these three hundred thousand francs at the end of three months, than to hasten his ruin and to have six or eight percent of the capital.
030.002 Unfortunately, either hatred or blindness, all the correspondents of Morrel did not make the same reflection, and some even made the opposite reflection. The drafts subscribed by Morrel were thus presented to the cashier with scrupulous rigor, and, thanks to the delay granted by the Englishman, were paid by Coclès at an open office. Coclès thus continued to remain in his fateful tranquility. M. Morrel alone saw with terror that if he had had to reimburse, on the 15th, the fifty thousand francs of M. de Boville, and, on the 30th, the thirty-two thousand five hundred francs of drafts for which, as well as for the debt of the inspector of prisons, he had a delay, he was from that month on a lost man.
030.003 The opinion of all the trade of Marseilles was that, under the successive reverses which overwhelmed it, Morrel could not hold. The astonishment was thus great when one saw his end of month filled with his usual exactitude. However, confidence did not return for that reason in the spirits, and one postponed with a unanimous voice to the end of the next month the deposition of the balance sheet of the unhappy shipowner.
030.004 The whole month was spent in unheard-of efforts on the part of Morrel to gather all his resources. In the past his paper, at whatever date, was taken with confidence, and even asked for. Morrel tried to negotiate ninety-day paper, and found the banks closed. Fortunately, Morrel himself had a few receipts on which he could count; these receipts were made: Morrel was thus still able to meet his commitments when the end of July arrived.
030.005 Moreover, the agent of Thomson and French had not been seen again in Marseilles; the day after or the day after his visit to Mr. Morrel, he had disappeared: now, as he had had relations in Marseilles only with the mayor, the inspector of prisons, and Mr. Morrel, his passage had left no other trace than the different memories that these three persons had kept of him. As for the sailors of the _Pharaon_, it seems that they had found some engagement, for they had also disappeared.
030.006 Captain Gaumard, recovered from the indisposition which had kept him in Palma, returned in his turn. He hesitated to present himself at Mr. Morrel's: but the latter learned of his arrival, and went to find him himself. The worthy shipowner knew in advance, from Penelon's account, the courageous conduct of the captain during the whole disaster, and it was he who tried to console him. He brought him the amount of his pay, which Captain Gaumard would not have dared to touch.
030.007 As he descended the staircase, Mr. Morrel met Penelon going up it. Penelon had, it seemed, made good use of his money, for he was all dressed in new clothes. On seeing his owner, the worthy helmsman seemed very embarrassed; he ranged himself in the farthest corner of the landing, passed his cheek alternately from left to right and from right to left, rolling big frightened eyes, and answered only by a timid pressure to the handshake which Mr. Morrel offered him with his usual cordiality. M. Morrel attributed Penelon's embarrassment to the elegance of his toilet: it was evident that the good man had not given himself over to such luxury; he was therefore already engaged on board some other vessel, and his shame came from the fact that he had not, if one may so express it, borne the mourning of the _Pharaon_ any longer. Perhaps he had even come to tell Captain Gaumard of his good fortune and to inform him of the offers of his new master.
030.008 "Good people," said Morrel as he walked away, "may your new master love you as I loved you, and be happier than I am!"
030.009 August passed in unceasing attempts by Morrel to raise his old credit or to open a new one. On August 20, it was known in Marseilles that he had taken a place at the mail coach, and it was then said that it was for the end of the current month that the balance sheet was to be deposited, and that Morrel had left in advance so as not to attend this cruel act, delegated no doubt to his first clerk Emmanuel and his cashier Coclès. But, against all expectations, when August 31 arrived, the cash register opened as usual. Coclès appeared behind the fence, calm as Horace's righteous man, examined with the same attention the paper presented to him, and, from the first to the last, paid the drafts with the same accuracy. There even came two reimbursements which Mr. Morrel had foreseen, and which Coclès paid with the same punctuality as the drafts which were personal to the shipowner. No one understood anything anymore, and with the tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news, the bankruptcy was postponed until the end of September.
030.010 On the 1st, Morrel arrived: he was awaited by all his family with great anxiety; from this trip to Paris was to arise his last means of salvation. Morrel had thought of Danglars, now a millionaire and formerly his servant, since it was on Morrel's recommendation that Danglars had entered the service of the Spanish banker with whom his immense fortune had begun. Today Danglars, it was said, had six or eight millions to himself, an unlimited credit. Danglars, without drawing a penny from his pocket, could save Morrel: he had only to guarantee a loan, and Morrel was saved. Morrel had long thought of Danglars; but there are those instinctive repulsions of which one is not master, and Morrel had delayed as long as it had been possible for him to resort to this supreme means. He had been right, for he had returned broken under the humiliation of a refusal.
030.011 Also on his return, Morrel had exhaled no complaint, uttered no recrimination; he had tearfully embraced his wife and daughter, had extended a friendly hand to Emmanuel, had locked himself in his second-floor cabinet, and had asked for Coclès.
030.012 "For this time," the two women had said to Emmanuel, "we are lost."
030.013 Then, in a short conciliabule held between them, it had been agreed that Julie would write to her brother, garrisoned in Nimes, to arrive at once.
030.014 The poor women felt instinctively that they needed all their strength to support the blow which threatened them.
030.015 Besides, Maximilien Morrel, though barely twenty-two years old, already had a great influence on his father.
030.016 He was a firm and upright young man. When it came to choosing a career, his father had not wanted to impose a future on him in advance and had consulted young Maximilien's tastes. The latter had then declared that he wanted to follow the military career; he had consequently made excellent studies, had entered by the contest to the Polytechnic School, and had left it second lieutenant to the 53rd of line. For a year, he occupied this rank, and had promised to be named lieutenant at the first opportunity. In the regiment, Maximilien Morrel was cited as the rigid observer, not only of all the obligations imposed on the soldier, but also of all the duties proposed to the man, and he was called only the stoic. It goes without saying that many of those who gave him this epithet repeated it because they had heard it, and did not even know what it meant.
030.017 It was this young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid to support them in the grave circumstance in which they felt they were going to find themselves.
030.018 They had not been mistaken about the gravity of this circumstance, because, a moment after Mr. Morrel had entered his cabinet with Coclès, Julie saw the latter come out of it, pale, trembling, and with his face all upset.
030.019 She wanted to question him as he passed by her; but the good man, continuing to descend the stairs with a haste that was not usual for him, contented himself with exclaiming, raising his arms to heaven:
030.020 "O mademoiselle! mademoiselle! what an awful misfortune! and who would ever have believed it!"
030.021 A moment later, Julie saw him come up carrying two or three large books, a wallet and a bag of money.
030.022 Morrel consulted the books, opened the wallet, and counted the money.
030.023 All his resources amounted to six or eight thousand francs, his receipts up to the 5th to four or five thousand; which made, by quoting at the highest, an asset of fourteen thousand francs to face a draft of two hundred and eighty-seven thousand five hundred francs. There was not even a way to offer such a down payment.
030.024 However, when Morrel came down to dinner, he seemed quite calm. This calmness frightened the two women more than the deepest dejection could have done.
030.025 After dinner, Morrel was in the habit of going out; he would have his coffee at the Cercle des Phocéens and read the _Sémaphore_: that day he did not go out and went back to his office.
030.026 As for Cocles, he seemed completely dazed. For part of the day he had been sitting on a stone in the courtyard, bareheaded, in the thirty-degree sun.
030.027 Emmanuel tried to reassure the women, but he was not very eloquent. The young man was too familiar with the affairs of the house not to feel that a great catastrophe was hanging over the Morrel family.
030.028 Night came: the two women had been awake, hoping that when Morrel came down from his study he would enter their house; but they heard him passing in front of their door, lightening his step in fear, no doubt, of being called.
030.029 They listened, he went into his room and closed his door.
030.030 Mrs. Morrel sent her daughter to bed; then, half an hour after Julie had retired, she got up, took off her shoes and slipped into the corridor, to see through the keyhole what her husband was doing.
030.031 In the corridor she saw a shadow withdrawing: it was Julie, who, worried herself, had preceded her mother.
030.032 The young girl went to Madame Morrel.
030.033 "He is writing," she said.
030.034 The two women had guessed each other without speaking.
030.035 Mme. Morrel leaned over to the lock. Indeed, Morrel was writing; but what her daughter had not noticed, Mrs. Morrel noticed, was that her husband was writing on marked paper.
030.036 This terrible idea came to her that he was making a will; she shivered with all her limbs, and yet she had the strength not to say anything.
030.037 The next day, Mr. Morrel seemed quite calm; he stood in his office as usual, went down to lunch as usual, only after his dinner he made his daughter sit down next to him, took the child's head in his arms and held it for a long time against his chest.
030.038 In the evening, Julie told her mother that, although apparently calm, she had noticed that her father's heart was beating violently.
030.039 The other two days passed in much the same way. On the evening of September 4, Mr. Morrel asked his daughter again for the key to his study.
030.040 Julie flinched at this request, which seemed sinister to her. Why was her father asking her again for this key which she had always had, and which in her childhood had only been taken away from her to punish her!
030.041 The girl looked at Mr. Morrel.
030.042 "What have I done wrong, father," she said, "that you should take this key away from me?
030.043 -Nothing, my child," replied the unfortunate Morrel, to whom this simple request brought tears to his eyes; "nothing, only I need it."
030.044 Julie pretended to look for the key.
030.045 "I will have left it at home," she said.
030.046 And she went out; but, instead of going to her house, she went downstairs and ran to consult Emmanuel.
030.047 "Don't give this key back to your father," said the latter, "and tomorrow morning, if possible, don't leave him."
030.048 She tried to question Emmanuel; but he knew nothing else, or would not say anything else.
030.049 All through the night of September 4 and 5, Mme Morrel remained with her ear pressed against the woodwork. Until three o'clock in the morning she heard her husband walking restlessly in his room.
030.050 Only at three o'clock did he throw himself on his bed.
030.051 The two women spent the night together. Since the evening before, they had been waiting for Maximilian.
030.052 At eight o'clock Mr. Morrel entered their room. He was calm, but the restlessness of the night could be seen on his pale and disheveled face.
030.053 The women did not dare ask him if he had slept well. Morrel was better to his wife, and more paternal to his daughter than he had ever been; he could not get enough of looking at and kissing the poor child.
030.054 Julie remembered Emmanuel's recommendation and wanted to follow her father when he went out; but he gently pushed her away:
030.055 "Stay close to your mother," he told her.
030.056 Julie wanted to insist.
030.057 "I want to!" said Morrel.
030.058 It was the first time that Morrel had said to his daughter: "I want to!" but he said it with an accent marked by such paternal gentleness that Julie did not dare to take a step forward.
030.059 She remained in the same place, standing, mute and motionless. A moment later the door opened again, she felt two arms surrounding her and a mouth pressing against her forehead.
030.060 She looked up and gave an exclamation of joy.
030.061 "Maximilian my brother!" she cried.
030.062 At this cry Mme Morrel ran up and threw herself into her son's arms.
030.063 "My mother," said the young man, looking alternately at Madame Morrel and her daughter, "what is the matter and what is happening? Your letter has frightened me and I am coming.
030.064 --Julie," said Mme. Morrel, beckoning to the young man, "go and tell your father that Maximilian has just arrived."
030.065 The young girl dashed out of the apartment, but on the first step of the stairs she found a man holding a letter in his hand.
030.066 "Aren't you Miss Julie Morrel?" said this man with a most pronounced Italian accent.
030.067 --Yes, sir," replied Julie, stammering; "but what do you want with me? I don't know you.
030.068 --Read this letter," said the man, handing her a bill.
030.069 Julie hesitated.
030.070 "The salvation of your father is at stake," said the messenger.
030.071 The girl snatched the bill from his hands.
030.072 Then she opened it quickly and read:
030.073 _"Go at once to the Allées de Meilhan, enter house No. 15, ask the concierge for the key to the room on the fifth floor, enter that room, take from the corner of the fireplace a purse made of red silk net, and bring this purse to your father._
030.074 _"It is important that he should have it before eleven o'clock.
030.075 _"You promised to obey me blindly, I remind you of your promise._
030.076 "SIMBAD THE SAILOR."
030.077 The girl gave a cry of joy, looked up, sought, to question him, the man who had given her this bill, but he had disappeared.
030.078 She then looked at the bill again and read it a second time, and saw that it had a _post-scriptum_.
030.079 She read:
030.080 "It is important that you fulfill this mission in person and alone; if you came accompanied or if someone other than you showed up, the concierge would reply that he doesn't know what we mean."
030.081 This _post-scriptum_ was a powerful correction to the girl's joy. Had she nothing to fear, was it not some trap that was being set for her? Her innocence left her unaware of the dangers that a young girl of her age could run, but one does not need to know the danger in order to fear; there is even one thing to be noticed, and that is that it is precisely the unknown dangers that inspire the greatest terrors.
030.082 Julie hesitated; she resolved to ask for advice.
030.083 But, by a strange feeling, it was not to her mother nor to her brother that she had recourse, it was to Emmanuel.
030.084 She went downstairs, told him what had happened to her on the day that the agent from Thomson and French had come to her father's house; she told him about the scene on the stairs, repeated the promise she had made and showed him the letter.
030.085 "You must go, mademoiselle," said Emmanuel.
030.086 --Go?" murmured Julie.
030.087 --Yes, I will go with you.
030.088 --But didn't you see that I must be alone? said Julie.
030.089 --You will be alone too, replied the young man; I will wait for you at the corner of the Rue du Musée; and if you delay in such a way as to give me cause for concern, then I will go and join you, and, I assure you, woe betide those of whom you would tell me that you have had cause for complaint!
030.090 -So, Emmanuel," the young girl continued hesitating, "your opinion is that I should accept this invitation?
030.091 --Yes; didn't the messenger tell you that your father's safety was at stake?
030.092 --But, Emmanuel, what danger is he in?" asked the girl.
030.093 Emmanuel hesitated for a moment, but the desire to make up his mind to the girl at once and without delay won out.
030.094 "Listen," he said to her, "today is the 5th of September, isn't it?
030.095 --Yes.
030.096 --Today, at eleven o'clock, your father has nearly three hundred thousand francs to pay.
030.097 --Yes, we know that.
030.098 --Well, says Emmanuel, he doesn't have fifteen thousand in cash.
030.099 --What will happen then?
030.100 --It will happen that if today, before eleven o'clock, your father has not found someone to help him, at noon your father will be forced to declare himself bankrupt.
030.101 --Oh! come! come!" cried the girl, dragging the young man with her.
030.102 Meanwhile, Mme Morrel had told her son everything.
030.103 The young man knew well that in consequence of the successive misfortunes that had befallen his father, great reforms had been made in the expenses of the house; but he did not know that things had come to this point.
030.104 He remained devastated. Then suddenly he rushed out of the apartment, climbed the stairs quickly, for he thought his father was in his study, but he knocked in vain. As he was at the door of this cabinet, he heard the door of the apartment open, he turned around and saw his father. Instead of going straight back to his study, Mr. Morrel had returned to his room and was only now coming out.
030.105 M. Morrel uttered a cry of surprise when he saw Maximilien; he was unaware of the young man's arrival. He remained motionless in the same place, clutching with his left arm an object which he held hidden under his frock coat.
030.106 Maximilian ran down the stairs and threw himself around his father's neck; but suddenly he drew back, leaving his right hand resting only on his father's breast.
030.107 "My father," he said, turning as pale as death, "why do you have a pair of pistols under your frock coat?
030.108 --Oh! this is what I feared!" said Morrel.
030.109 -My father! my father! in the name of Heaven! cried the young man, why these weapons?
030.110 --Maximilian, replied Morrel, looking fixedly at his son, you are a man, and a man of honor; come, I will tell you."
030.111 And Morrel went up with a confident step to his cabinet while Maximilian followed him, staggering.
030.112 Morrel opened the door and closed it behind his son; then he crossed the anteroom, approached the desk, laid his pistols on the corner of the table, and showed his son an open register with his fingertip.
030.113 On this register was recorded the exact state of affairs.
030.114 Morrel had to pay in half an hour two hundred and eighty-seven thousand five hundred francs.
030.115 He had in all fifteen thousand two hundred and fifty-seven francs.
030.116 "Read," said Morrel.
030.117 The young man read and remained for a moment as if crushed.
030.118 Morrel did not say a word: what could he have said that would have added to the inexorable stop of the figures?
030.119 "And you have done everything, my father," said the young man after a moment, "to meet this misfortune?
030.120 --Yes," replied Morrel.
030.121 --You don't count on any return?
030.122 --On none.
030.123 --You have exhausted all your resources?
030.124 --All of them.
030.125 --And in half an hour, said Maximilian in a dark voice, our name is dishonored. Blood washes away dishonor, said Morrel.
030.126 --You are right, my father, and I understand you."
030.127 Then, extending his hand toward the pistols:
030.128 "There is one for you and one for me, he said; thank you!"
030.129 Morrel stopped his hand.
030.130 "And your mother... and your sister..., who will feed them?"
030.131 A shiver ran through the young man's whole body.
030.132 "Father," he said, "do you think you are telling me to live?
030.133 --Yes, I am telling you," said Morrel, "for it is your duty; you have a calm, strong spirit, Maximilian.... Maximilian, you are no ordinary man; I command you nothing, I order you nothing, only I say to you: Examine your situation as if you were a stranger to it, and judge it for yourself."
030.134 The young man thought for a moment, then an expression of sublime resignation passed into his eyes; only he removed, with a slow and sad movement, his epaulette and counter-epaulette, the insignia of his rank.
030.135 "It is well," he said, extending his hand to Morrel, "die in peace, my father! I shall live."
030.136 Morrel made a movement to throw himself at his son's knees. Maximilian drew him to him, and these two noble hearts beat a moment against each other.
030.137 "You know that it is not my fault?" said Morrel.
030.138 Maximilian smiled.
030.139 "I know, father, that you are the most honest man I have ever known.
030.140 -That's good, all is said: now go back to your mother and your sister.
030.141 -My father, said the young man, bending the knee, bless me!"
030.142 Morrel seized his son's head between his two hands, brought it close to him, and, impressing his lips on it several times:
030.143 "Oh, yes, yes," he said, "I bless you in my name and in the name of three generations of blameless men; listen, then, to what they say by my voice: the edifice which misfortune has destroyed, Providence can rebuild. Seeing me die such a death, the most inexorable will have pity on you; to you perhaps they will give the time they would have refused me; then try not to let the infamous word be pronounced; get to work, work, young man, fight ardently and courageously: live, you, your mother and your sister, of the bare necessities so that, day by day, the good of those to whom I owe increases and fructifies in your hands. Think that it will be a beautiful day, a great day, a solemn day, that of rehabilitation, the day when, in this very office, you will say: "My father died because he could not do what I am doing today; but he died calmly and quietly, because he knew when he died that I would do it.
030.144 --Oh, my father, my father," cried the young man, "if you could live!
030.145 -If I live, everything changes; if I live, interest changes into doubt, pity into relentlessness; if I live, I am no more than a man who has broken his word, who has failed in his commitments, I am no more than a bank robber. If I die, on the contrary, think about it, Maximilien, my corpse is no more than that of an unhappy honest man. Alive, my best friends avoid my house; dead, all of Marseilles follows me, weeping, to my last resting place; alive, you are ashamed of my name; dead, you raise your head and say:
030.146 "--I am the son of one who killed himself, because for the first time he was forced to break his word."
030.147 The young man gave a groan, but he seemed resigned. It was the second time that conviction had entered not his heart, but his mind.
030.148 "And now," said Morrel, "leave me alone and try to keep the women away.
030.149 --Don't you want to see my sister again?" asked Maximilian.
030.150 A last and dull hope was hidden for the young man in this interview, that is why he proposed it. M. Morrel shook his head.
030.151 "I saw her this morning," he said, "and I said good-bye to her.
030.152 --Didn't you have some particular recommendation to make to me, Father?" asked Maximilian in an altered voice.
030.153 --So done, my son, a sacred recommendation.
030.154 --Say, Father.
030.155 --The house of Thomson and French is the only one that, out of humanity, out of selfishness perhaps, but it is not for me to read the hearts of men, has taken pity on me. His agent, the one who, in ten minutes, will present himself to receive the amount of a draft of two hundred and eighty-seven thousand five hundred francs, I will not say has granted me, but has offered me three months. Let this house be paid off first, my son, let this man be sacred to you.
030.156 --Yes, father, said Maximilian.
030.157 --And now once more farewell, said Morrel, go, go, I need to be alone; you will find my will in the secretary in my bedroom."
030.158 The young man stood inert, having only strength of will, but no execution.
030.159 "Listen, Maximilian," said his father, "suppose I were a soldier like yourself, and had received orders to carry off a redoubt, and you knew that I must be killed in carrying it off, would you not say to me what you said to me just now: 'Go, father, for you dishonor yourself by staying, and better death than "shame!"
030.160 --Yes, yes, said the young man, yes."
030.161 And, clasping Morrel convulsively in his arms:
030.162 "Go, Father," he said.
030.163 And he dashed out of the cabinet.
030.164 When his son had gone out, Morrel stood for a moment with his eyes fixed on the door; then he stretched out his hand, found the cord of a bell and rang.
030.165 After a moment Coclès appeared.
030.166 He was no longer the same man; these three days of conviction had broken him. The thought that Maison Morrel was going to stop making payments bowed him down to the earth more than twenty other years would have done to his head.
030.167 "My good Coclès," said Morrel with an accent whose expression it would be impossible to convey, "you are going to remain in the anteroom. When this gentleman who has already come three months ago, you know, the agent of the house of Thomson and French, comes, you will announce him."
030.168 Coclès made no reply; he nodded, went and sat down in the anteroom and waited.
030.169 Morrel fell back on his chair; his eyes went to the clock: he had seven minutes left, that's all; the hand was moving with incredible rapidity; it seemed to him that he saw it going.
030.170 What happened then, and in that supreme moment in the mind of this man who, still young, following a false reasoning perhaps, but specious at least, was going to separate himself from all that he loved in the world and to leave the life, which had for him all the sweetness of the family, is impossible to express: it would have been necessary to see, to take an idea of it, his forehead covered with sweat, and yet resigned, his eyes wet with tears, and yet lifted up to heaven.
030.171 The needle was still working, the pistols were all loaded; he stretched out his hand, took one, and murmured the name of his daughter.
030.172 Then he put down the deadly weapon, took the pen and wrote a few words.
030.173 It seemed to him then that he had not said goodbye enough to his beloved child.
030.174 Then he turned back to the clock; he no longer counted by the minute but by the second.
030.175 He took up the weapon again, his mouth half-open and his eyes fixed on the needle; then he flinched at the noise he himself made in cocking the dog.
030.176 At this moment a colder sweat passed over his forehead, a more mortal anguish gripped his heart.
030.177 He heard the door of the staircase scream on its hinges.
030.178 Then the door to his study opened.
030.179 The clock was about to strike eleven.
030.180 Morrel did not turn around, he was waiting for these words from Coclès: "The agent of the house of Thomson and French."
030.181 And he brought the gun up to his mouth....
030.182 Suddenly he heard a cry: it was the voice of his daughter.
030.183 He turned around and saw Julie; the gun slipped out of her hand.
030.184 "Father!" cried the girl, out of breath and almost dying with joy, "saved! you are saved!
030.185 And she threw herself into his arms, raising in her hand a purse of red silk net.
030.186 "Saved! my child!" said Morrel; "what do you mean?
030.187 --Yes, saved! see, see!" said the girl.
030.188 Morrel took the purse and flinched, for a vague recollection reminded him of the object as having belonged to him. On one side was the draft for two hundred and eighty-seven thousand five hundred francs.
030.189 The draft was paid.
030.190 On the other was a diamond the size of a hazelnut, with these three words written on a small piece of parchment: "Dot de Julie." Morrel passed his hand over his forehead. He thought he was dreaming. At that moment, the clock struck eleven.
030.191 The bell vibrated for him as if each blow of the steel hammer vibrated on his own heart.
030.192 "Let us see, my child," he said, "explain yourself. Where did you find this purse?
030.193 --In a house in the Allées de Meilhan, at No. 15, on the corner of the chimney of a poor little room on the fifth floor.
030.194 --But, cried Morrel, this purse is not yours."
030.195 Julie handed her father the letter she had received in the morning.
030.196 "And you have been alone in this house?" said Morrel after reading.
030.197 --Emmanuel accompanied me, Father. He was supposed to be waiting for me at the corner of the Rue du Musée; but strangely enough, when I returned, he was no longer there.
030.198 --Monsieur Morrel!" cried a voice on the stairs, "Monsieur Morrel!
030.199 - "It's his voice," said Julie.
030.200 At the same time, Emmanuel entered, his face flushed with joy and emotion.
030.201 "The _Pharaoh_!" he cried; "the _Pharaoh_!
030.202 --Well, what? the _Pharaoh_! Are you mad, Emmanuel? You know very well that he is lost.
030.203 --The _Pharaoh_! sir, the _Pharaoh_ is reported; the _Pharaoh_ is entering the port."
030.204 Morrel fell back in his chair, his strength failed him, his intelligence refused to classify this sequence of incredible, unheard-of, fabulous events.
030.205 But his son entered in his turn.
030.206 "Father," cried Maximilian, "what did you say about the _Pharaoh_ being lost? The lookout has reported it, and it is entering the harbor.
030.207 "My friends," said Morrel, "if that were so, we should believe in a miracle from God! Impossible! impossible!
030.208 But what was real and no less incredible was that purse he held in his hands, it was that paid bill of exchange, it was that magnificent diamond.
030.209 "Ah, monsieur," said Coclès in his turn, "what does that mean, the _Pharaon_?
030.210 --All right, my children," said Morrel, rising, "let us go and see, and may God have mercy on us, if it is false news."
030.211 They went down; in the middle of the staircase awaited Mme. Morrel: the poor woman had not dared to go up.
030.212 In an instant they were at the Canebière.
030.213 There was a crowd on the port.
030.214 The whole crowd opened up before Morrel.
030.215 "The _Pharaoh_! the _Pharaoh_!" said all these voices.
030.216 Indeed, a marvelous, unheard-of thing, in front of the tower of St. John a vessel, bearing on its stern these words written in white letters, the _Pharaon_ (Morrel et fils de Marseille), absolutely of the same size as the other _Pharaon_, and loaded like the other with cochineal and indigo, was dropping anchor and furling its sails; on deck, Captain Gaumard was giving his orders, and Master Penelon was making signs to M. Morrel.
030.217 There was no longer any doubt about it: the testimony of the senses was there, and ten thousand people were helping with this testimony.
030.218 As Morrel and his son embraced on the pier, to the applause of the whole town which witnessed this prodigy, a man, whose face was half covered by a black beard, and who, hidden behind the guardhouse of a factionary, contemplated this scene with tenderness, murmured these words:
030.219 "Be happy, noble heart; be blessed for all the good you have done and will do again; and let my gratitude remain in the shadows as your benefit."
030.220 And, with a smile in which joy and happiness were revealed, he left the shelter where he was hidden, and without anyone paying attention to him, so preoccupied was everyone with the event of the day, he descended one of those little staircases that serve as a landing and hailed three times:
030.221 "Jacopo! Jacopo! Jacopo!"
030.222 Then a rowboat came to him, received him on board, and led him to a richly rigged yacht, on the deck of which he sprang with the lightness of a sailor; from there he looked once more at Morrel, who, weeping with joy, distributed cordial handshakes to the whole crowd, and thanked with a vague glance that unknown benefactor whom he seemed to be looking for in heaven.
030.223 "And now, says the unknown man, goodbye kindness, humanity recognition.... Farewell to all the feelings that open up the heart!... I have substituted myself for Providence to reward the good... may the avenging God yield his place to me to punish the wicked!"
030.224 At these words he made a signal, and, as if he had only been waiting for this signal to leave, the yacht at once set sail.
031.000 Italy.--Simbad the sailor.
031.001 Towards the beginning of 1838, two young men belonging to the most elegant society of Paris were in Florence, one, the viscount Albert de Morcerf, the other, the baron Franz d'Épinay. It had been agreed between them that they would spend the carnival of the same year in Rome, where Franz, who had been living in Italy for nearly four years, would serve as cicerone to Albert.
031.002 Now, as it is not a small matter to go to spend the carnival in Rome, especially when one makes a point of not sleeping in the Piazza del Popolo or in the Campo-Vaccino, they wrote to Master Pastrini, owner of the Hotel de Londres, in the Place d'Espagne, to ask him to reserve a comfortable apartment for them.
031.003 Master Pastrini replied that he had only two rooms and a study at the second floor at their disposal, and that he was offering them a modest fee of one louis per day. The two young men accepted; then, wanting to make the most of the time he had left, Albert left for Naples. As for Franz, he remained in Florence.
031.004 When he had enjoyed for some time the life that the city of the Medici gives, when he had walked well in this Eden that is called the Casines, when he had been received by these magnificent hosts who do the honors of Florence, it took him fancy, having already seen Corsica, this cradle of Bonaparte, to go to see the island of Elba, this great relay of Napoleon.
031.005 One evening therefore he detached a barchetta from the iron ring which sealed it in the port of Livorno, lay down at the bottom in his coat, saying to the sailors these only words: "To the island of Elba!"
031.006 The boat left the port like the sea bird leaves its nest, and the next day it disembarked Franz at Porto-Ferrajo.
031.007 Franz crossed the imperial island, after having followed all the traces that the steps of the giant left there, and went to embark in Marciana.
031.008 Two hours after having left the land, he took it again to go down to the Pianosa, where, it was assured, infinite flights of red partridges were waiting for him.
031.009 The hunt was bad. Franz killed a few thin partridges with great difficulty, and, like any hunter who has tired himself out for nothing, he climbed back into his boat in a rather bad mood.
031.010 "Ah! if Your Excellency would like," said the skipper, "he would make a fine hunt!
031.011 --And where?
031.012 --Do you see that island?" continued the skipper, extending his finger towards the south and pointing to a conical mass that emerged from the middle of the sea tinted with the most beautiful indigo.
031.013 --Well, what is this island?
031.014 --The island of Monte Cristo, answered the Livornese.
031.015 --But I have no permission to hunt on this island.
031.016 --Your Excellency has no need, the island is deserted.
031.017 --Ah, by God, said the young man, a deserted island in the middle of the Mediterranean, it is a curious thing.
031.018 --And a natural thing, Excellency. This island is a bank of rocks, and, in all its extent, there is perhaps not an acre of plowable land.
031.019 -- And to whom does this island belong?
031.020 -- To Tuscany.
031.021 -- What game will I find there?
031.022 -- Thousands of wild goats.
031.023 --Who live by licking the stones, said Franz with a smile of incredulity.
031.024 --No, but by grazing on the heather, the myrtle, the mastic trees that grow in their intervals.
031.025 --But where shall I lie?
031.026 -- On land in the caves, or on board in your coat. Besides, if His Excellency wishes, we can leave immediately after the hunt; he knows that we sail as well by night as by day, and that in default of sail we have oars."
031.027 As there was still time enough for Franz to join his companion, and as he no longer had to worry about his lodging in Rome, he accepted this proposal to compensate himself for his first hunt.
031.028 On his affirmative answer, the sailors exchanged a few words among themselves in a low voice.
031.029 "Well," he asked, "what have we got now? Has some impossibility arisen?
031.030 -- No," said the skipper, "but we must warn Your Excellency that the island is in absentia.
031.031 -- What does that mean?
031.032 -- It means that, as Monte Cristo is uninhabited, and is sometimes used as a resting-place by smugglers and pirates who come from Corsica, Sardinia, or Africa, if any sign indicates that we are on the island, we shall be forced, on our return to Livorno, to make a quarantine of six days.
031.033 --Diable! that changes the thesis! six days! Just as much as it took God to create the world. That's a bit long, my children.
031.034 --But who will say that His Excellency was at Monte Cristo?
031.035 --Oh, it's not me," cried Franz.
031.036 -- Nor us, said the sailors.
031.037 -- In this case, go for Monte Cristo."
031.038 The skipper ordered the maneuver; they set course for the island, and the boat began to sail in its direction. Franz let the operation be completed, and when the new course had been taken, when the sail had been inflated by the breeze, and the four bargemen had resumed their places, three at the bow, one at the helm, he renewed the conversation.
031.039 "My dear Gaetano," he said to the skipper, "you have just told me, I believe, that the island of Monte Cristo served as a refuge for pirates, which seems to me to be a much different game than goats.
031.040 -- Yes, Excellency, and that is the truth.
031.041 -- I knew that smugglers existed, but I thought that since the capture of Algiers and the destruction of the Regency, pirates only existed in the novels of Cooper and Captain Marryat.
031.042 -- Well, Your Excellency was mistaken: it is the case with pirates as with bandits, who are supposed to be exterminated by Pope Leo XII, and who nevertheless stop travelers every day right up to the gates of Rome. Have you not heard that only six months ago the French chargé d'affaires to the Holy See was robbed five hundred steps from Velletri?
031.043 --So done.
031.044 -- Well, if, like us, Your Excellency lived in Livorno, he would hear from time to time that a small ship loaded with merchandise or a pretty English yacht, which was expected at Bastia, Porto-Ferrajo or Civita-Vecchia, has not arrived, that no one knows what has become of it, and that without doubt it will have broken up against some rock. Well, this rock which he met, it is a low and narrow boat, assembled of six or eight men, who surprised or plundered it by a dark and stormy night with the turning of some wild and uninhabited islet, like bandits stop and plunder a post office chair at the corner of a wood.
031.045 --But finally, Franz continued, still lying in his boat, how can those to whom such an accident happens not complain, how can they not call upon these pirates the vengeance of the French, Sardinian or Tuscan government?
031.046 --Why? said Gaetano with a smile.
031.047 --Yes, why?
031.048 --Because first of all everything that is good to take is carried from the ship or yacht to the boat; then the crew is bound hand and foot, a ball of 24 is tied to the neck of each man, a hole the size of a barrel is made in the keel of the captured ship, the ship is brought up on deck, the hatches are closed, and the boat is put on. After ten minutes, the ship began to moan and groan, and little by little it sank. First one side sinks, then the other; then it rises, then it sinks again, sinking more and more. All of a sudden, a noise similar to a cannon shot resounds: it is the air which breaks the bridge. Then the ship shakes like a drowning man struggling, getting heavier with each movement. Soon the water, too much pressed in the cavities, rushes out of the openings, similar to the liquid columns that some gigantic sperm whale would throw out of its vents. At last it utters a last rattle, makes a last turn on itself, and engulfs itself by digging in the abyss a vast funnel which swirls for a moment, fills up little by little and ends by fading away completely; so much so that at the end of five minutes it takes the eye of God himself to go and search at the bottom of this calm sea for the disappeared vessel.
031.049 "Do you understand now," added the skipper, smiling, "how the ship does not return to the harbor, and why the crew does not complain?"
031.050 Had Gaetano told the thing before proposing the expedition, it is probable that Franz would have looked twice before undertaking it; but they had gone, and it seemed to him that it would be cowardly to back out. He was one of those men who do not run to a perilous occasion, but who, if that occasion comes before them, remain unaltered in composure to fight it: he was one of those men of calm will, who regard a danger in life only as an adversary in a duel, who calculate his movements, who study his strength, who break off enough to regain his breath, not enough to appear cowardly, who, understanding at a single glance all their advantages, kill at a single blow.
031.051 "Bah!" he said, "I have crossed Sicily and Calabria, I have sailed two months in the archipelago, and I have never seen the shadow of a bandit or a forban.
031.052 -- "I did not say that to His Excellency," said Gaetano, "to make her give up her project; she questioned me and I answered her, that is all.
031.053 --Yes, my dear Gaetano, and your conversation is most interesting; so as I want to enjoy it as long as possible, go for Monte Cristo."
031.054 However, we were rapidly approaching the end of the voyage; it was a cool wind, and the boat was making six or seven miles an hour. As we approached, the island seemed to grow out of the bosom of the sea; and, through the limpid atmosphere of the last rays of daylight, we could distinguish, like cannonballs in an arsenal, that heap of rocks piled one upon another, and in the interstices of which we could see reddening heather and greening trees. As for the sailors, although they appeared perfectly quiet, it was obvious that their vigilance was awake, and that their glance questioned the vast mirror on which they slipped, and of which some fishermen's boats, with their white sails, populated alone the horizon, swinging like seagulls at the end of the waves.
031. 055 They were hardly more than fifteen miles from Monte-Cristo when the sun began to set behind Corsica, whose mountains appeared on the right, cutting out on the sky their dark jaggedness; this mass of stones, similar to the giant Adamastor, rose threateningly in front of the boat to which it hid the sun whose upper part gilded itself little by little the shadow rose from the sea and seemed to chase before it this last reflection of the day which was going to be extinguished, finally the luminous ray was pushed back until the top of the cone, where it stopped one moment like the ignited plume of a volcano: finally the shade, always ascending, invaded gradually the top, as it had invaded the base, and the island appeared no more than a gray mountain which was always going to become darker. Half an hour later, it was dark.
031.056 Fortunately the sailors were in their usual vicinity and knew every rock in the Tuscan archipelago; for, in the midst of the deep darkness that enveloped the boat, Franz would not have been entirely without anxiety. Corsica had entirely disappeared, the island of Monte Cristo had itself become invisible, but the sailors seemed to have, like the lynx, the faculty of seeing in the darkness, and the pilot, who stood at the helm, did not show the least hesitation.
031.057 About an hour had passed since sunset, when Franz thought he saw, a quarter of a mile to the left, a dark mass, but it was so impossible to distinguish what it was, that, fearing to excite the hilarity of his sailors, by mistaking a few floating clouds for dry land, he kept silent. But suddenly a great glow appeared on the shore; the land may have looked like a cloud, but the fire was not a meteor.
031.058 "What is this light?" he asked.
031.059 --Hush!" said the boss, "it's a fire.
031.060 --But you said that the island was uninhabited!
031.061 --I said that it had no fixed population, but I also said that it is a resting place for smugglers.
031.062 --And for pirates!
031.063 --And for the pirates, said Gaetano, repeating Franz's words; that is why I gave the order to pass the island, because, as you see, the fire is behind us.
031.064 --But this fire, Franz continued, seems to me to be more a reason for safety than for anxiety; people who feared to be seen would not have lit this fire.
031.065 --Oh, that means nothing, said Gaetano, if you could judge, in the midst of the darkness, the position of the island, you would see that, placed as it is, this fire can be seen neither from the coast nor from the Pianosa, but only from the open sea.
031.066 - So you fear that this fire will announce us bad company?
031.067 --That is what we will have to make sure of, continued Gaetano, his eyes still fixed on this terrestrial star.
031.068 --And how can we be sure?
031.069 --You will see."
031.070 At these words Gaetano held council with his companions, and at the end of five minutes of discussion, a maneuver was executed in silence, with the aid of which, in an instant, they had turned about; then they resumed the course they had just taken, and a few seconds after this change of direction, the light disappeared, hidden by some movement of the ground.
031.071 Then the pilot put the rudder in a new direction for the little ship, which came visibly closer to the island and soon found itself only fifty paces away.
031.072 Gaetano lowered the sail and the boat remained stationary.
031.073 All this was done in the greatest silence, and besides, since the change of course, not a word had been spoken on board.
031.074 Gaetano, who had proposed the expedition, had taken all the responsibility for it upon himself. The four sailors did not leave him out of sight, while preparing the oars and being obviously ready to make force of oars, which, thanks to the darkness, was not difficult.
031.075 As for Franz, he visited his weapons with that composure that we know him to have; he had two double-barreled shotguns and a carbine, he loaded them, made sure of the batteries, and waited.
031.076 Meanwhile, the boss had thrown down his coat and shirt, secured his pants around his loins, and, as he was barefoot, he had neither shoes nor stockings to undo. Once in this costume, or rather out of it, he put a finger to his lips to signal for the deepest silence, and, letting himself sink into the sea, he swam towards the shore with so much caution that it was impossible to hear the slightest noise. Only by the phosphorescent furrow that his movements gave off could one follow his trail.
031.077 Soon this very furrow disappeared: it was obvious that Gaetano had touched down.
031.078 Everyone on the little ship remained motionless for half an hour, after which the same luminous furrow appeared again near the shore and approached the boat. At the end of an instant, and in two spells, Gaetano had reached the boat.
031.079 "Well?" said Franz and the four sailors together.
031.080 --Well, he said, they are Spanish smugglers; they have only two Corsican bandits with them.
031.081 --And what are these two Corsican bandits doing with Spanish smugglers?
031.082 -- Oh, my God! Your Excellency," Gaetano said in a tone of deep Christian charity, "we must help each other. Often the bandits find themselves a little pressed on land by the gendarmes or the carabinieri, well, they find a boat there, and in this boat good boys like us. They come to ask us for hospitality in our floating house. How can we refuse help to a poor devil who is being chased! We receive him, and, for greater safety, we gain the wide. This costs us nothing and saves the life or, at least, the freedom of one of our fellow men who, on occasion, recognizes the service we have rendered him by indicating to us a good place where we can unload our goods without being disturbed by the curious.
031.083 --Ah, says Franz, you are a little smuggler yourself, my dear Gaetano?
031.084 --Eh! what do you want, Excellency! he said with a smile impossible to describe, one does a little of everything; one must live.
031.085 --So you are acquainted with the people who live in Monte Cristo at this time?
031.086 -- Just about. We sailors are like the Freemasons, we recognize each other by certain signs.
031.087 -- And you think we would have nothing to fear if we were to disembark in our turn?
031.088 --Absolutely nothing, smugglers are not thieves.
031.089 --But those two Corsican bandits..." continued Franz, calculating in advance all the chances of danger.
031.090 --Oh my God!" said Gaetano, "it's not their fault they're bandits, it's the authority's.
031.091 --How so?
031.092 --Surely! they are prosecuted for having made a _peau_, not anything else; as if it were not in the nature of the Corsican to take revenge!
031.093 -- What do you mean by having made a _peau_? To have murdered a man?" said Franz, continuing his investigations.
031.094 -- I mean to have killed an enemy," continued the boss, "which is quite different.
031.095 -- Well, said the young man, let us go and ask the smugglers and bandits for hospitality. Do you think they will give it to us?
031.096 --Without a doubt.
031.097 --How many are there?
031.098 -- Four, Excellency, and the two bandits make six.
031.099 --Well, that's just our number; we are even, in case these gentlemen show bad dispositions, in equal strength, and therefore in a position to contain them. So, one last time, go for Monte Cristo.
031.100 -- Yes, Excellency, but you will allow us to take a few more precautions?
031.101 --How now, my dear! Be wise as Nestor, and prudent as Ulysses. I do more than allow you, I urge you to do so.
031.102 -- "Well then, silence!" said Gaetano.
031.103 Everyone was silent.
031.104 For a man who, like Franz, considered everything from his true point of view, the situation, without being dangerous, was not without a certain gravity. He found himself in the deepest darkness, isolated, in the middle of the sea, with sailors who did not know him and who had no reason to be devoted to him; who knew that he had a few thousand francs in his belt, and who had ten times, if not with envy, at least with curiosity, examined his weapons, which were very beautiful. On the other hand, he was going to land, without any other escort than these men, in an island which bore a very religious name, but which did not seem to promise Franz any other hospitality than that of Calvary to Christ, thanks to its smugglers and bandits. Then this story of sunken ships, which he had believed to be exaggerated during the day, seemed more likely to him at night. Also, placed as he was between this double perhaps imaginary danger, he did not leave these men of the eyes and his rifle of the hand.
031.105 However, the sailors had once again hoisted their sails and had resumed the furrow they had already dug on their way to and from the ship. Through the darkness Franz, already somewhat accustomed to the darkness, could distinguish the granite giant that the boat was passing; then finally, passing again the corner of a rock, he saw the fire shining, brighter than ever, and around this fire five or six people were sitting.
031.106 The reverberation of the hearth extended from a hundred steps to the sea. Gaetano sailed along the light, but kept the boat in the unlit part; then, when it was completely in front of the fireplace, he set a course for it and bravely entered the circle of light, singing a fishermen's song which he alone supported, and whose refrain his companions took up in chorus.
031.107 At the first word of the song, the men seated around the hearth had risen and approached the landing stage, their eyes fixed on the boat, whose strength and intentions they were visibly trying to judge. Soon they seemed to have made a sufficient examination and went, with the exception of one who remained standing on the shore, to sit around the fire, before which a whole kid was roasting.
031.108 When the boat had come within twenty paces of the land, the man on the shore mechanically made the gesture of a sentry waiting for a patrol with his rifle, and shouted _Qui vive_! in Sardinian patois.
031.109 Franz coldly armed his two shots. Gaetano then exchanged some words with the man, which the traveler did not understand, but which obviously concerned him.
031.110 "His Excellency," asked the boss, "does he want to give his name or remain incognito?
031.111 -My name must be perfectly unknown; therefore, tell them simply, Franz continued, that I am a Frenchman traveling for his pleasures."
031.112 When Gaetano had conveyed this answer, the sentry gave an order to one of the men seated before the fire, who at once rose, and disappeared into the rocks.
031.113 There was silence. Everyone seemed preoccupied with his own business: Franz with his landing, the sailors with their sails, the smugglers with their goats, but in the midst of this apparent carelessness, they observed each other.
031.114 The man who had gone away suddenly reappeared on the opposite side of the ship from where he had disappeared. He nodded to the sentry, who turned to their side and merely uttered these words: _S'accommodi_.
031.115 The Italian _s'accommodi_ is untranslatable; it means at once, come, enter, be welcome, make yourself at home, you are the master. It is like that Turkish phrase of Moliere's, which so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the quantity of things it contained.
031.116 The sailors were not told twice: in four strokes of the oars, the boat touched land. Gaetano jumped onto the shore, exchanged a few more words in a low voice with the sentry, his companions went down one after the other; then finally came Franz's turn.
031.117 He had one of his rifles slung over his shoulder, Gaetano had the other, and one of the sailors held his rifle. His costume was that of an artist and a dandy at the same time, which did not arouse any suspicion in the guests, and consequently no concern.
031.118 The boat was moored to the shore, and a few steps were taken in search of a convenient bivouac; but without doubt the point toward which they were heading was not convenient for the smuggler who filled the position of overseer, for he shouted to Gaetano:
031.119 "No, point this way, please."
031.120 Gaetano stammered an apology, and, without insisting further, went forward to the opposite side, while two sailors, to light the way, went to light torches at the fireplace.
031.121 They went about thirty paces and stopped on a small esplanade surrounded by rocks in which they had dug a sort of seat, similar to a small sentry box, where they would sit on guard. Around them grew, in veins of vegetable earth, some dwarf oaks and thick clumps of myrtle. Franz lowered a torch and recognized, from a heap of ashes, that he was not the first to notice the comfort of this place, and that it must be one of the usual stations of the nomadic visitors of the island of Monte Cristo.
031.122 As for his expectation of an event, it had ceased; once he had set foot on dry land, once he had seen the dispositions, if not friendly, then at least indifferent, of his hosts, all his preoccupation had disappeared, and, at the smell of the kid roasting in the nearby bivouac, preoccupation had changed to appetite.
031.123 He spoke to Gaetano about this new incident, who replied that there was nothing simpler than a supper when one had, as they had in their boat, bread, wine, six partridges and a good fire to roast them.
031.124 "Besides," he added, "if your Excellency finds the smell of this kid so tempting, I can go and offer our neighbors two of our birds for a slice of their quadruped.
031.125 --Do, Gaetano, do," said Franz; "you are truly born with the genius of negotiation."
031.126 Meanwhile, the sailors had torn up armfuls of heather, made bundles of myrtle and holm oak, to which they had set fire, which presented a rather respectable hearth.
031.127 Franz was waiting impatiently, still smelling the scent of the kid, for the boss to return, when the latter reappeared and came to him with a very worried look.
031.128 "Well," he asked, "what's new?
031.129 "On the contrary," said Gaetano. The chief, who has been told that you are a young Frenchman, invites you to dine with him.
031.130 -- Well, but, said Franz, he is a very civilized man, and I don't see why I should refuse; especially since I am bringing my share of the supper.
031.131 --Oh, that's not it: he has enough for supper, and more, but it's that he puts a singular condition on your presentation to him.
031.132 -His house!" said the young man; "has he built a house?
031.133 -- No; but he has a very comfortable home, as far as we can tell.
031.134 -- So you know this chief?
031.135 -- I have heard of him.
031.136 -- Good or bad?
031.137 -- Both ways.
031.138 --Diable! And what is this condition?
031.139 --It is to let you be blindfolded and to take off your blindfold only when he invites you to do so himself."
031.140 Franz probed Gaetano's eyes as much as possible to see what was behind this proposal.
031.141 "Oh lady!" said the latter, answering Franz's thought, "I know it well, the thing deserves reflection.
031.142 --What would you do in my place?
031.143 -- I, who have nothing to lose, would go.
031.144 -- Would you accept?
031.145 -- Yes, if only out of curiosity.
031.146 -- Is there anything curious about this chief?
031.147 -- Listen," said Gaetano, lowering his voice, "I don't know if what they say is true..."
031.148 He paused, looking to see if any stranger was listening.
031.149 "And what do they say?
031.150 --They say that this chief lives in a subterranean world where the Pitti Palace is of little consequence.
031.151 --What a dream!" said Franz, sitting down again.
031.152 --Oh, it is not a dream, continued the master, it is a reality! Cama, the pilot of the _Saint-Ferdinand_, entered it one day, and came out all amazed, saying that there are such treasures only in fairy tales.
031.153 --Ah, but do you know, said Franz, that with such words you would have me descend into the cave of Ali-Baba?
031.154 -- I am telling you what I have been told, Excellency.
031.155 -- Then you advise me to accept?
031.156 -- I am not saying that! Your Excellency will do as he pleases. I wouldn't want to give him advice on an occasion like this."
031.157 Franz thought for a few moments, understood that this man who was so rich could not blame him, who was carrying only a few thousand francs; and, as he saw in all this only an excellent supper, he accepted. Gaetano went to bring his answer.
031.158 However, as we have said, Franz was cautious; so he wanted to have as many details as possible about his strange and mysterious host. He therefore turned to the sailor who, during this dialogue, had been plucking partridges with the gravity of a man proud of his duties, and asked him in what his men had been able to board, since neither boats, nor speronarias, nor tartans could be seen.
031.159 "I am not worried about that," said the sailor, "and I know the ship they are sailing in.
031.160 --Is it a nice ship?
031.161 -- I wish Your Excellency a similar one to sail around the world.
031.162 --How strong is it?
031.163 -- About a hundred tons. It is, moreover, a fancy ship, a yacht, as the English say, but made up, you see, so as to hold the sea in all weathers.
031.164 -- And where was it built?
031.165 -- I do not know. However, I think it was built in Genoa.
031.166 -- And how does a smuggler's leader, continued Franz, dare to have a yacht built for his trade in the port of Genoa?
031.167 -- I did not say, said the sailor, that the owner of this yacht was a smuggler.
031.168 -- No; but Gaetano said so, it seems to me.
031.169 --Gaetano had seen the crew from afar, but he had not yet spoken to anyone.
031.170 --But if this man is not a chief smuggler, what is he?
031.171 --A rich lord who travels for his pleasure."
031.172 "Come," thought Franz, "the character is all the more mysterious, since the versions are different."
031.173 "And what is his name?
031.174 -When asked, he answers that he is called Simbad the sailor. But I doubt that this is his real name.
031.175 --Simbad the sailor?
031.176 -- Yes.
031.177 -- And where does this lord live?
031.178 --On the sea.
031.179 --From what country is he?
031.180 --I don't know.
031.181 -Have you seen him?
031.182 -- Sometimes.
031.183 --What man is he?
031.184 --Your Excellency will judge for himself.
031.185 --And where will he receive me?
031.186 --No doubt in that underground palace of which Gaetano spoke to you.
031.187 --And you never had the curiosity, when you were released here and found the island deserted, to try to enter this enchanted palace?
031.188 -- "Yes, I did, Your Excellency," said the sailor, "and more than once; but our searches were always useless. We have searched the cave on all sides and have not found the slightest passage. Besides, it is said that the door is not opened with a key, but with a magic word.
031.189 - "Well, decidedly," murmured Franz, "here I am in a tale from the Arabian Nights.
031.190 --His Excellency awaits you," said a voice behind him which he recognized as that of the sentry. The newcomer was accompanied by two men of the yacht's crew. For all answer, Franz drew his handkerchief and presented it to the one who had spoken to him.
031.191 Without saying a word, they blindfolded him with a care that indicated the fear that he might commit some indiscretion; then they made him swear that he would not try in any way to take off his blindfold.
031.192 He swore. Then the two men each took him by the arm, and he walked along guided by them and preceded by the sentry. After about thirty steps, he sensed, by the increasingly appetizing smell of the kid, that he was passing in front of the bivouac; then they made him continue his way for another fifty steps, obviously advancing on the side where they had not wanted to let Gaetano enter: a defense which was now explained. Soon, to the change of atmosphere, he understood that he entered an underground; at the end of a few seconds of walk, he heard a cracking, and it seemed to him that the atmosphere changed again of nature and became tepid and perfumed; finally, he felt that his feet put on a thick and soft carpet; his guides abandoned him. There was a moment's silence, and a voice said in good French, though with a foreign accent:
031.193 "You are welcome to my house, sir, and you may remove your handkerchief."
031. 194 As one can well imagine, Franz did not have this invitation repeated twice; he raised his handkerchief, and found himself in front of a man of thirty-eight to forty years of age, wearing a Tunisian costume, that is to say, a red skullcap with a long tassel of blue silk, a jacket of black cloth all embroidered with gold, wide and baggy oxblood pants, gaiters of the same color embroidered with gold like the jacket, and yellow slippers; a splendid cashmere tightened the size to him, and a small sharp and curved cangiar was passed in this belt.
031.195 Although almost lividly pale, this man had a remarkably beautiful figure; his eyes were lively and piercing; his straight nose, and almost level with the forehead, indicated the Greek type in all its purity, and his teeth, white as pearls, stood out admirably under the black moustache that framed them.
031.196 Only this pallor was strange; it looked like a man who had long been shut up in a tomb, and who had not been able to regain the complexion of the living.
031.197 Without being of great height, he was well made, and, like the men of the South, had small hands and feet.
031.198 But what astonished Franz, who had called Gaetano's story a dream, was the sumptuousness of the furnishings.
031.199 The whole room was hung with crimson Turkish cloths embroidered with golden flowers. In a recess was a kind of couch surmounted by a trophy of Arab weapons with gilt scabbards and handles resplendent with gems; on the ceiling hung a lamp of Venetian glass, of a charming form and color, and the feet rested on a Turkish carpet in which they sank to the ankle: doors hung in front of the door by which Franz had entered, and in front of another door giving passage to a second room which appeared splendidly lit.
031.200 The host left Franz for a moment in surprise, and besides he gave him examination for examination, and did not leave him out of sight.
031.201 "Sir," he said to him at last, "a thousand pardons for the precautions that have been required of you in order to introduce you to my house: but, as this island is deserted most of the time, if the secret of this dwelling were known, I should probably find, on returning, my pied-à-terre in a rather bad state, which would be very unpleasant for me, not because of the loss that it would cause me, but because I would not have the certainty of being able, when I wanted to, to separate myself from the rest of the world. Now I will try to make you forget this little inconvenience, by offering you what you certainly did not expect to find here, that is to say a passable supper and fairly good beds.
031.202 - "My dear host," replied Franz, "you need not apologize for that. I have always seen that people were blindfolded when they entered enchanted palaces: see Raoul in the _Huguenots_, and truly I have nothing to complain about, for what you are showing me follows on the heels of the marvels of the _Mille et une Nuits_.
031.203 -- Alas! I will say to you as Lucullus did: If I had known that I would have the honor of your visit, I would have prepared myself for it. But at last, as my hermitage is, I place it at your disposal; as it is, my supper is offered to you. Ali, are we served?"
031.204 Almost at the same instant the door was raised, and a Nubian Negro, black as ebony and clad in a simple white tunic, beckoned to his master that he might pass into the dining-room.
031.205 "Now," said the stranger to Franz, "I don't know whether you agree with me, but I find nothing so awkward as to remain two or three hours alone without knowing by what name or title to call oneself. Please note that I respect the laws of hospitality too much to ask you for either your name or your title; I only beg you to give me some name by which I can address you. As for me, to put you at your ease I will tell you that I am used to being called Simbad the sailor.
031.206 -- And I," Franz continued, "will tell you that, as I lack only the famous marvelous lamp to be in the situation of Aladdin, I see no difficulty in your calling me Aladdin for the moment. This will not take us out of the East, where I am tempted to believe that I have been transported by the power of some good genie.
031.207 --Well, lord Aladdin," said the strange amphitryon, "you have heard that we are served, haven't you? So please take the trouble to enter the dining room; your most humble servant goes before you to show you the way."
031.208 And at these words, lifting the door, Simbad actually passed Franz by.
031.209 Franz walked from enchantment to enchantment; the table was splendidly served. Once convinced of this important point, he looked around him. The dining room was no less splendid than the boudoir he had just left; it was all marble, with antique bas-reliefs of the greatest price, and at the two ends of this room, which was oblong, two magnificent statues carried baskets on their heads. These baskets contained two pyramids of magnificent fruits; they were pineapples from Sicily, pomegranates from Malaga, oranges from the Balearic Islands, peaches from France and dates from Tunis.
031.210 As for the supper, it consisted of a roasted pheasant surrounded by blackbirds from Corsica, a ham of wild boar in jelly, a quarter of kid in tartar sauce, a magnificent turbot and a gigantic lobster. The intervals of the large dishes were filled by small dishes containing the entremets.
031.211 The dishes were made of silver, the plates of Japanese porcelain.
031.212 Franz rubbed his eyes to make sure he was not dreaming.
031.213 Ali was the only one allowed to serve and he did it very well. The guest complimented his host.
031.214 "Yes," said the latter, while doing the honors of his supper with the greatest ease; "yes, he is a poor devil who is very devoted to me and who does his best. He remembers that I saved his life, and as he valued his head, so it seems, he kept me somewhat grateful for having preserved it for him."
031.215 Ali approached his master, took his hand and kissed it.
031.216 "And would it be too indiscreet, Lord Simbad," said Franz, "to ask you under what circumstances you did this beautiful deed?
031.217 --Oh, my God, it is very simple, answered the host. It seems that the funny man had prowled closer to the seraglio of the bey of Tunis than was proper for a fellow of his color; so that he had been condemned by the bey to have his tongue, his hand, and his head cut off: his tongue on the first day, his hand on the second, and his head on the third. I had always wanted to have a mute in my service; I waited until he had his tongue cut out, and I went to propose to the bey to give him to me for a magnificent two-shot rifle which, the day before, had seemed to me to arouse the desires of His Highness. He hesitated for a moment, so much he wanted to finish with this poor devil. But I added to this rifle an English hunting knife with which I had chopped up the yatagan of His Highness; so that the bey decided to pardon him by hand and by head, but on condition that he would never set foot in Tunis again. The recommendation was useless. From the farthest that the miscreant sees the coast of Africa, he flees to the bottom of the ship, and one can only get him out of there when one is out of sight of the third part of the world."
031.218 Franz remained for a moment mute and thoughtful, seeking what he should think of the cruel bonhomie with which his host had just given him this account.
031.219 "And, like the honorable sailor whose name you have taken," he said, changing the conversation, "you spend your life traveling?
031.220 --Yes; it is a vow I made in a time when I hardly thought I could fulfill it," said the stranger, smiling. I have made a few like it, and which I hope will all be fulfilled in their turn."
031.221 Although Simbad had spoken these words with the greatest composure, his eyes had cast a look of strange ferocity.
031.222 "Have you suffered much, sir?" said Franz.
031.223 Simbad flinched and stared at him.
031.224 "What do you see?" he asked.
031.225 -- From everything," Franz continued, "from your voice, from your eyes, from your pallor, and from the very life you lead.
031.226 -- I lead the happiest life I know, a real pasha's life; I am the king of creation: I like a place, I stay there; I am bored, I leave; I am free like the bird, I have wings like it; the people around me obey me at a sign. From time to time, I amuse myself by mocking human justice by taking away a bandit it is looking for, a criminal it is pursuing. Then I have my own justice, low and high, without reprieve and without appeal, which condemns or absolves, and to which nobody has anything to do. Ah! if you had tasted my life, you would not want any other, and you would never enter the world, unless you had some great project to accomplish.
031.227 "Revenge, for instance," said Franz.
031.228 The stranger fixed on the young man one of those glances which plunge deep into the heart and the mind.
031.229 "And why revenge?" he asked.
031.230 --Because," Franz continued, "you seem to me like a man who, persecuted by society, has a terrible score to settle with it.
031.231 --Well," laughed Simbad, with his strange laugh that showed his sharp white teeth, "you are not; as you see me, I am a sort of philanthropist, and perhaps one day I shall go to Paris to compete with M. Appert and the man in the little blue coat.
031.232 --And this will be the first time you make this trip?
031.233 --Oh, my God, yes. I don't seem to be very curious, do I? But I assure you that it's not my fault if I've been so late, it will come sooner or later!
031.234 --And do you intend to make this journey soon?
031.235 -- I do not know yet, it depends on circumstances subject to uncertain combinations.
031.236 -- I would like to be there at the time when you come, and I would try to return to you, insofar as it is in my power, the hospitality that you give me so generously at Monte Cristo.
031.237 --I would accept your offer with great pleasure," continued the host; "but unfortunately, if I go, it will perhaps be incognito."
031.238 The supper, however, was advancing, and seemed to have been served for Franz's sole purpose, for scarcely had the stranger touched with the tip of his teeth one or two dishes of the splendid feast which he had offered him, and to which his unexpected guest had so amply honored.
031.239 Finally, Ali brought the dessert, or rather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them on the table.
031.240 Between the two baskets he placed a small gilt bowl closed by a lid of the same metal.
031.241 The respect with which Ali had brought this cup piqued Franz's curiosity. He lifted the lid and saw a kind of greenish paste that looked like angelica jam, but which was completely unknown to him.
031.242 He replaced the lid, as ignorant of what the cup contained after putting the lid back on as he had been before he lifted it, and, returning his eyes to his host, he saw him smile in disappointment.
031.243 "You can't guess," said the latter, "what kind of edible is in that little vase, and that puzzles you, doesn't it?
031.244 -- I admit it.
031.245 -- Well, this sort of green jam is neither more nor less than the ambrosia that Hebe served at Jupiter's table.
031.246 --But this ambrosia, said Franz, has undoubtedly, in passing through the hands of men, lost its celestial name to take on a human one; in the vulgar language, what is the name of this ingredient, for which, incidentally, I do not feel much sympathy?
031.247 -- "This is what reveals our material origin," cried Simbad; "we often pass by happiness without seeing it, without looking at it, or, if we have seen and looked at it, without recognizing it. Are you a positive man and is gold your god, taste this, and the mines of Peru, Guzarate and Golconde will be opened to you. Are you a man of imagination, are you a poet, taste this again, and the barriers of the possible will disappear; the fields of the infinite will open, you will walk, free of heart, free of mind, in the boundless domain of reverie. Are you ambitious? Do you chase after the greatness of the earth, taste of this always, and in an hour you will be king, not king of a small kingdom hidden in a corner of Europe, like France, Spain or England, but king of the world, king of the universe, king of the creation. Your throne will be set up on the mountain where Satan carried Jesus away; and, without having to pay him homage, without being forced to kiss his claw, you will be the sovereign master of all the kingdoms of the earth. Isn't it tempting, what I am offering you here, and isn't it a very easy thing to do, since there is nothing else to do? Look."
031.248 At these words he in turn uncovered the little gilt cup which contained the much-praised substance, took a teaspoonful of the magic preserves, brought it to his mouth, and savored it slowly, with his eyes half closed, and his head thrown back.
031.249 Franz gave him plenty of time to absorb his favorite food, and then, when he saw that he had come to his senses a little, said
031.250 "But at last," he said, "what is this precious food?
031.251 - "Have you heard of the Old Man of the Mountain," asked his host, "the same one who wanted to have Philip Augustus killed?
031.252 --Surely.
031.253 --Well, you know that he ruled over a rich valley that dominated the mountain from which he took his picturesque name. In this valley were magnificent gardens planted by Hassen-ben-Sabah, and, in these gardens, isolated pavilions. It was in these pavilions that he made his chosen ones enter, and there he made them eat, says Marco-Polo, a certain herb that transported them to paradise, in the midst of plants always in bloom, of fruits always ripe, of women always virgins. Now, what these blessed young people took for reality, it was a dream; but a dream so sweet, so intoxicating, so voluptuous, that they sold themselves body and soul to the one who had given it to them, and that obeying his orders as to those of God, they went to strike at the end of the world the indicated victim, dying in torture without complaining at the only idea that the death they were undergoing was only a transition to that life of delights of which this holy herb, served in front of you, had given them a taste.
031.254 -Then, exclaimed Franz, it is hashish! Yes, I know it, at least by name.
031.255--You have said the word, Lord Aladdin, it is hashish, all the best and purest hashish made in Alexandria, the hashish of Abougor, the great maker, the unique man, the man to whom a palace should be built with this inscription: To the merchant of happiness, the grateful world.
031.256 -Do you know, Franz said to him, that I would like to judge for myself the truth or exaggeration of your praise?
031.257 -- Judge for yourself, my guest, judge; but do not confine yourself to a first experience: as in all things, the senses must be accustomed to a new impression, sweet or violent, sad or joyful. There is a struggle of nature against this divine substance, of nature which is not made for joy and which clings to pain. Nature must succumb in the struggle, reality must succeed the dream, and then the dream reigns supreme, then it is the dream that becomes life and the life that becomes the dream: but what a difference in this transfiguration! that is to say, when you compare the pains of real existence with the pleasures of fictitious existence, you will no longer want to live, and you will want to dream always. When you leave your own world for the world of others, it will seem to you to pass from a Neapolitan spring to a Lappish winter, it will seem to you to leave the paradise for the earth, the sky for the hell. Taste hash, my guest! Taste it!"
031.258 For all answer, Franz took a spoonful of this wonderful paste, measured on the one his amphitryon had taken, and brought it to his mouth.
031.259 "Devil!" he said after swallowing the divine jams, "I don't know yet whether the result will be as pleasant as you say, but the thing doesn't seem to me to be as succulent as you say.
031.260 --Because the bows of your palate are not yet made to the sublimity of the substance they taste. Tell me: did you love oysters, tea, porter, truffles, all of which you later adored? Do you understand the Romans, who seasoned pheasants with assafoetida, and the Chinese, who eat swallows' nests? My God, no. Well, it is the same with hashish: eat it only eight days in a row, no food in the world will seem to you to reach the delicacy of this taste which seems to you today perhaps bland and nauseating. By the way, let us go into the next room, that is, into your room, and Ali will serve us coffee and give us pipes."
031.261 Both rose, and while he who had given himself the name of Simbad, and whom we have so named from time to time, so that he, like his guest, might give him some name, gave some orders to his servant, Franz entered the adjoining room.
031.262 This was more simply furnished, though not less richly. It was round in shape, and a large couch went all around it. But the couch, the walls, the ceiling, and the floor were all covered with magnificent skins, soft and fluffy like the softest carpets; they were the skins of Atlas lions with powerful manes; They were skins of Bengal tigers with warm stripes, skins of Cape panthers joyfully spotted like the one that appears to Dante, and finally skins of Siberian bears, of Norwegian foxes, and all these skins were thrown in profusion one on top of the other, in such a way that one would have thought one was walking on the thickest turf and resting on the silkiest bed.
031.263 Both of them lay down on the couch, chibouques with jasmine pipes and amber books were at hand, and all prepared so that one did not have to smoke twice in the same one. They each took one. Ali lit them and went out to get coffee.
031.264 There was a moment's silence, during which Simbad gave himself up to the thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly, even in the midst of his conversation, and Franz gave himself up to that silent reverie into which one almost always falls when smoking excellent tobacco, which seems to carry away with the smoke all the sorrows of the mind and to give back to the smoker all the dreams of the soul.
031.265 Ali brought the coffee.
031.266 "How will you take it?" said the stranger: "French or Turkish style, strong or light, sweet or unsweetened, strained or boiled?
031.267 -- I'll take it Turkish style," replied Franz.
031.268 --And you are right, exclaimed his host, that proves that you have a disposition for Oriental life. Ah, the Orientals, you see, are the only men who know how to live! As for me," he added with one of those singular smiles that did not escape the young man, "when I have finished my business in Paris, I will go and die in the East, and if you want to find me then, you will have to come and look for me in Cairo, in Baghdad, or in Ispahan.
031.269 --My faith, said Franz, that will be the easiest thing in the world, for I believe I am growing eagles' wings, and with those wings I would fly around the world in twenty-four hours.
031.270 --Ah! ah! it's the hash that works, well, open your wings and fly away into the superhuman regions; don't be afraid, we'll watch over you, and if, like Icarus', your wings melt in the sun, we're here to receive you.
031.271 Then he said a few Arabic words to Ali, who made a gesture of obedience and withdrew, but without going far.
031.272 As for Franz, a strange transformation was taking place in him. All the physical fatigue of the day, all the preoccupation of the mind which the events of the evening had given rise to, disappeared as in that first moment of rest when one still lives enough to feel sleep coming. His body seemed to acquire an immaterial lightness, his mind became clearer in an unheard-of way, his senses seemed to double their faculties; the horizon was still widening, but no longer that dark horizon over which hovered a vague terror and which he had seen before his sleep, but a blue horizon, transparent, vast, with all that the sea has of azure, with all that the sun has of spangles, with all that the breeze has of perfumes then, in the middle of the songs of his sailors, songs so limpid and so clear that one would have made a divine harmony of them if one could have noted them, he saw appearing the island of Monte-Cristo, not any more like a threatening reef on the waves, but like an oasis lost in the desert; Then as the boat approached, the songs became more numerous, for an enchanting and mysterious harmony rose from this island to God, as if some fairy, like Lorelay, or some enchanter like Amphion, had wanted to attract a soul or build a city there.
031.273 At last the boat touched the shore, but without effort, without shaking as lips touch lips, and he returned to the cave without this charming music ceasing. He descended, or rather it seemed to him that he descended a few steps, breathing that fresh and embalmed air like that which must have reigned around Circe's cave, made of such perfumes as to make the mind dream, of such ardors as to make the senses burn, and he saw again all that he had seen before his sleep, from Simbad, the fantastic guest, to Ali, the mute servant; Then everything seemed to fade and merge before his eyes, like the last shadows of a magic lantern that is extinguished, and he found himself in the room of statues, lit only by one of those pale, antique lamps that watch over sleep or pleasure in the middle of the night.
031.274 They were indeed the same statues rich in form, in lust and in poetry, with magnetic eyes, lascivious smiles, opulent hair. It was Phryne, Cleopatra, Messalina, these three great courtesans: then in the middle of these impure shadows slipped, like a pure ray, like a Christian angel in the middle of Olympus, one of these chaste figures, one of these calm shadows, one of these soft visions which seemed to veil its virginal front under all these impurities of marble.
031. 275 Then it appeared to him that these three statues had joined their three loves for only one man, and that this man was him, that they approached the bed where he dreamed a second sleep, the feet lost in their long white tunics, the naked throat, the hair unrolling like a wave, with one of those poses to which the gods succumbed, but which the saints resisted, with one of those inflexible and ardent glances like that of the snake on the bird, and that he abandoned himself to those glances painful like an embrace, voluptuous like a kiss.
031.276 It seemed to Franz that he closed his eyes, and that through the last glance he cast around him he glimpsed the modest statue which was entirely veiled; then his eyes closed to real things, his senses opened to impossible impressions.
031.277 Then it was a voluptuousness without rest, a love without rest, like that which the Prophet promised to his chosen ones. Then all these stone mouths became alive, all these breasts became warm, so much so that for Franz, undergoing for the first time the empire of hashish, this love was almost a pain, this voluptuousness almost a torture, when he felt passing over his altered mouth the lips of these statues, supple and cold like the rings of a snake; But the more his arms tried to push back this unknown love, the more his senses underwent the charm of this mysterious dream, so that after a fight for which one would have given his soul, he gave himself up without reserve and finished by falling down again panting, burned of tiredness, exhausted of voluptuousness, under the kisses of these marble mistresses and under the enchantments of this incredible dream.
032.000 Awakening.
032.001 When Franz returned to him, the external objects seemed a second part of his dream; he believed himself in a sepulchre where penetrated hardly, like a glance of pity, a ray of sun; he extended the hand and felt stone; he put himself on his feet: he was lying in his burnous, on a bed of dry heather very soft and very odorous.
032.002 All vision had disappeared, and, as if the statues had been only shadows that had come out of their tombs during his dream, they had fled when he awoke.
032.003 He took a few steps towards the point from which the day came; all the agitation of the dream was succeeded by the calm of reality. He saw himself in a cave, went to the side of the opening, and through the arched door he saw a blue sky and a blue sea. The air and the water glistened with the rays of the morning sun; on the shore the sailors sat chatting and laughing; ten paces out to sea the boat rocked gracefully on its anchor.
032. 004 Then he savored for a while the fresh breeze that passed over his forehead; he listened to the weakened noise of the wave that moved on the shore and left on the rocks a lace of foam as white as silver; He let himself go without thinking, without thinking of that divine charm which there is in the things of nature, especially when one comes out of a fantastic dream; then little by little this life of outside, so calm, so pure, so great, reminded him of the implausibility of his sleep, and the memories began to return to his memory.
032.005 He remembered his arrival in the island, his presentation to a chief of smugglers, an underground palace full of splendors, an excellent supper and a spoonful of hashish.
032.006 Only, in front of this reality of full day, it seemed to him that there was at least a year that all these things had happened, so much the dream which he had made was alive in his thought and took importance in his spirit. Also from time to time his imagination made sit in the middle of the sailors, or cross a rock, or swing on the boat, one of these shadows which had starred his night of their kisses. Besides, his head was perfectly free and his body perfectly rested: no heaviness in the brain, but, on the contrary, a certain general well-being, a faculty of absorbing the air and the sun greater than ever.
032.007 So he approached his sailors cheerfully.
032.008 As soon as they saw him again, they stood up, and the boss approached him.
032.009 "Lord Simbad," he said to him, "has charged us with all his compliments for your Excellency, and has told us to express to him the regret that he is unable to take leave of her; but he hopes that you will excuse him when you know that a very pressing matter calls him to Malaga.
032.010 - "Oh, my dear Gaetano," said Franz, "all this is really true: there is a man who received me on this island, who gave me royal hospitality, and who left while I was sleeping?
032.011 --He exists so well, that here is his little yacht sailing away, all sails out, and that, if you want to take your scope, you will in all probability recognize your host in the midst of his crew."
032.012 And, while saying these words, Gaetano extended his arm in the direction of a small vessel which was sailing towards the southern point of Corsica.
032.013 Franz drew his telescope, put it at his point of view, and directed it towards the indicated place.
032.014 Gaetano was not mistaken. On the back of the building, the mysterious stranger stood turned to his side, and holding like him a telescope in his hand; he had in every respect the costume under which he had appeared the day before to his guest, and waved his handkerchief in sign of farewell.
032.015 Franz returned his greeting by drawing out his handkerchief in turn and waving it as he waved his own.
032.016 After a second, a light cloud of smoke appeared at the stern of the ship, detached itself gracefully from the stern and rose slowly toward the sky; then a faint detonation reached Franz.
032.017 "Here, do you hear," said Gaetano, "here he is saying goodbye!"
032.018 The young man took his rifle and discharged it into the air, but without any hope that the noise could cross the distance that separated the yacht from the shore.
032.019 "What does Your Excellency order?" said Gaetano.
032.020 - First, that you light a torch for me.
032.021 - "Yes, I understand," said the owner, "to find the entrance to the enchanted apartment. Much pleasure, Excellence, if the thing amuses you, and I am going to give you the requested torch. I, too, have been possessed by the idea that holds you, and I have passed the fantasy three or four times; but I ended up giving it up. Giovanni," he added, "light a torch and bring it to His Excellency."
032.022 Giovanni obeyed. Franz took the torch and entered the underground, followed by Gaetano.
032.023 He recognized the place where he had awakened to his bed of heather still all crumpled; but he was able to walk his torch on all the external surface of the cave he did not see anything, if it is not, to traces of smoke, that others before him had already tried uselessly the same investigation.
032.024 However he did not leave a foot of this granite wall, impenetrable like the future, without examining it; he did not see a crack that he did not introduce the blade of his hunting knife into it; he did not notice a salient point that he did not press on it, in the hope that it would give way; but all was useless, and he lost, without any result, two hours in this search.
032.025 At the end of this time, he gave up; Gaetano was triumphant.
032.026 When Franz returned to the beach, the yacht appeared only like a small white point to the horizon, he had recourse to his telescope, but even with the instrument it was impossible to distinguish anything.
032.027 Gaetano reminded him that he had come to hunt goats, which he had completely forgotten. He took his rifle and began to traverse the island with the air of a man who fulfills a duty rather than takes pleasure, and after a quarter of an hour he had killed a goat and two kids. But these goats, though wild and alert as chamois, bore too great a resemblance to our domestic goats, and Franz did not regard them as game.
032.028 Then much more powerful ideas preoccupied his mind. Since the day before he had really been the hero of a tale from the Arabian Nights, and invincibly he was drawn back to the cave.
032.029 Then, in spite of the uselessness of his first search, he started a second one, after having told Gaetano to roast one of the two kids. This second visit lasted long enough, because when he returned the kid was roasted and the lunch was ready.
032.030 Franz sat down at the place where the day before, one had come to invite him to supper on behalf of this mysterious host, and he saw again like a seagull rocked on the top of a wave, the small yacht which continued to advance towards Corsica.
032.031 "But," he said to Gaetano, "you told me that the Lord Simbad was sailing for Malaga, while it seems to me that he is heading directly for Porto-Vecchio.
032.032 -- Don't you remember," said the owner, "that among the people in his crew I told you that there were two Corsican bandits at the moment?
032.033 --That's true! and he is going to throw them on the coast? said Franz.
032.034 -- Just so. Ah! he is an individual, exclaimed Gaetano, who fears neither God nor the devil, so they say, and who will go fifty leagues out of his way to do a poor man a favor.
032.035 --But this kind of service could well cause him to fall out with the authorities of the country where he exercises this kind of philanthropy, said Franz.
032.036 - "Well," said Gaetano, laughing, "what does he care about the authorities? We only have to try to pursue him. First of all, his yacht is not a ship, it's a bird, and it would make three knots out of twelve to a frigate; and then he only has to throw himself on the coast, won't he find friends everywhere?"
032.037 What was clearest in all this was that Lord Simbad, Franz's host, had the honor of being in connection with smugglers and bandits on all the coasts of the Mediterranean; which did not leave but to establish for him a rather strange position.
032.038 As for Franz, nothing retained him any more at Monte Cristo, he had lost all hope of finding the secret of the cave, he thus hastened to lunch by ordering his men to keep their boat ready for the moment when he would have finished.
032.039 Half an hour later he was on board.
032.040 He took one last look at the yacht; it was ready to disappear into the Gulf of Porto-Vecchio.
032.041 He gave the signal for departure.
032.042 As the boat set off, the yacht disappeared. With him the last reality of the previous night disappeared: also supper, Simbad, hashish and statues, all started, for Franz, to melt in the same dream. The boat walked all day and all night; and the next day, when the sun rose, it was the island of Monte Cristo which had disappeared in its turn. Once Franz had touched land, he forgot, momentarily at least, the events that had just taken place, in order to finish his business of pleasure and politeness in Florence, and to occupy himself only with joining his companion, who was waiting for him in Rome.
032.043 He thus left, and on Saturday evening he arrived at the place of the Customs by the mail coach.
032.044 The apartment, as we said, was retained in advance, there was thus only to join the hotel of Master Pastrini; which was not very easy thing, because the crowd encumbered the streets, and Rome was already in prey to this dull and feverish rumour which precedes the great events. Now, in Rome, there are four great events a year: Carnival, Holy Week, Corpus Christi and St. Peter's Day.
032.045 All the rest of the year, the city falls again in its morne apathie, state intermediate between the life and the death, which makes it similar to a kind of station between this world and the other one, sublime station, halt full of poetry and character that Franz had already made five or six times, and that every time he had found more marvelous and more fantastic still.
032.046 Finally, he crossed this crowd always larger and more agitated and reached the hotel. On his first request he was told, with that impertinence peculiar to detained carriage drivers and to all the innkeepers, that there was no more room for him at the London hotel. Then he sent his card to Master Pastrini, and made himself claimed by Albert de Morcerf. The means succeeded, and Master Pastrini himself came running, apologizing for having kept His Excellency waiting, scolding his boys, taking the candlestick from the hand of the cicerone who had already seized the traveler, and was preparing to lead him to Albert, when the latter came to meet him.
032.047 The selected apartment consisted of two small rooms and a cabinet. The two rooms gave on the street, circumstance which Master Pastrini put forward as adding an inappreciable merit to it. The rest of the floor was rented to a very rich person, who was thought to be Sicilian or Maltese; the hotelkeeper could not say to which of the two nations this traveler belonged.
032.048 "That's very good, Master Pastrini," said Franz, "but we need a supper of some sort for tonight, and a carriage for tomorrow and the following days.
032.049 --As for the supper, replied the innkeeper, you will be served at once; but as for the carriage....
032.050 -How can I say that? As for the carriage! cried Albert. I am not going to be able to do anything about it, but I am not going to be able to do anything about it, and I am not going to be able to do anything about it.
032.051 - "Sir," said the innkeeper, "we will do everything we can to get you one. That is all I can say to you.
032.052 --And when will we have the answer?
032.053 --Tomorrow morning, answered the innkeeper.
032.054 --What the hell! said Albert, we'll pay more for it, that's all: we know what it is; at Drake's or Aaron's twenty-five francs for ordinary days and thirty or thirty-five francs for Sundays and holidays; put five francs per day of brokerage, that'll make forty and let's not talk about it anymore.
032.055 -- I am afraid that these gentlemen, even if they offered twice as much, would not be able to get it.
032.056 --So let them put horses on mine; it's a little worn from the trip, but that doesn't matter.
032.057 --We won't find any horses."
032.058 Albert looked at Franz like a man to whom one makes an answer that seems incomprehensible to him.
032.059 "Do you understand that, Franz! no horses," he said; "but post horses, couldn't we have some?
032.060 --They have all been rented for a fortnight, and now only those absolutely necessary for the service remain.
032.061 --What do you say to that?" asked Franz.
032.062 -- I say that when a thing passes my understanding, I am in the habit of not dwelling on it and of moving on to another. Is supper ready, Master Pastrini?
032.063 -- Yes, Excellency.
032.064 -- Well, let's have supper first.
032.065 --But the carriage and the horses? said Franz.
032.066 --Don't worry, dear friend, they will come by themselves; it will only be a matter of putting the price on them."
032.067 And Morcerf, with that admirable philosophy which believes nothing impossible as long as it feels its round purse or its lined wallet, supped, went to bed, fell asleep on both ears, and dreamed that he was running the carnival in a six-horse carriage.
033.000 Roman bandits.
033.001 The next day, Franz woke up first, and as soon as he woke up, rang the bell.
033.002 The ringing of the bell was still vibrating, when Master Pastrini entered in person.
033.003 "Well," said the host triumphantly, without even waiting for Franz to question him, "I suspected it yesterday, Excellency, when I didn't want to promise you anything; you were too late, and there isn't a single carriage left in Rome: for the last three days, that is.
033.004 -- Yes," Franz continued, "that is, for those days when it is absolutely necessary.
033.005 --What's the matter?" asked Albert as he entered, "no carriage?
033.006 -- Right, my dear friend," replied Franz, "and you guessed it at first.
033.007 -- Well, here is a pretty city that your eternal city!
033.008 --That is to say, Excellency," continued Master Pastrini, who wished to maintain the capital of the Christian world in a certain dignity with regard to its travelers, "that is to say, there are no more carriages from Sunday morning until Tuesday evening, but by then you will find fifty if you want.
033.009 --Ah, that's something, says Albert; today is Thursday; who knows, between now and Sunday, what may happen?
033.010 -- Ten or twelve thousand travelers will arrive, replied Franz, which will make the difficulty even greater.
033.011 -My friend, said Morcerf, let us enjoy the present and not darken the future.
033.012 --At least, asked Franz, we can have a window?
033.013 --On what?
033.014 --On the Rue du Cours, by Jove!
033.015 --Ah, yes, a window!" exclaimed Master Pastrini; "impossible; of all impossibilities! There was one left on the fifth floor of the Doria palace, and it was rented to a Russian prince for twenty sequins a day."
033.016 The two young men looked at each other in amazement.
033.017 "Well, my dear," said Franz to Albert, "do you know the best thing to do? It is to go and spend Carnival in Venice; at least there, if we can't find a carriage, we'll find gondolas.
033.018 --Ah, no, my goodness!" exclaimed Albert, "I have decided that I will see the carnival in Rome, and I will see it there, even on stilts.
033.019 -Here! exclaimed Franz, it is a triumphant idea, especially to extinguish the moccoletti, we will disguise ourselves as vampire bugs or as inhabitants of the Landes, and we will have a crazy success.
033.020 -Do their Excellencies still want a car until Sunday?
033.021 --Parbleu! said Albert, do you think we are going to run the streets of Rome on foot, like bailiffs?
033.022 -- I will hasten to carry out the orders of Their Excellencies, said Master Pastrini: only I warn them that the carriage will cost them six piastres a day.
033.023 -- And I, my dear Mr. Pastrini," said Franz, "I, who am not our neighbor the millionaire, warn you in my turn, that since this is the fourth time that I have come to Rome, I know the price of the carriages on ordinary days, Sundays and holidays. We will give you twelve piasters for today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, and you will still have a very nice profit.
033.024 --Dependently, Excellency!... said Master Pastrini, trying to rebel.
033.025 -- Go, my dear host, go, said Franz, or I will myself make my price with your _affettatore_, who is mine too, he is an old friend of mine, who has already stolen quite a bit of money from me in his life, and who, in the hope of stealing more from me, will go through with a lower price than the one I am offering you: you will therefore lose the difference and that will be your fault.
033.026 -- Do not take this trouble, Excellence, said Master Pastrini, with this smile of the Italian speculator who admits defeat, I will do my best, and I hope that you will be satisfied.
033.027 -- Wonderful! That is what is called talking. When do you want the car?
033.028 -- In an hour.
033.029 --In an hour it will be at the door."
033.030 An hour later, indeed, the carriage was waiting for the two young men: it was a modest fiacre which, in view of the solemnity of the occasion, had been raised to the rank of a carriage; but, however mediocre its appearance, the two young men would have been quite happy to have such a vehicle for the last three days.
033.031 "Excellency!" cried the cicerone, as he saw Franz put his nose to the window, "must the carriage be brought near the palace?"
033.032 As accustomed as Franz was to the Italian emphases, his first movement was to look around him but it was well to himself that these words were addressed.
033.033 Franz was the Excellence; the carriage was the fiacre; the palace was the London hotel.
033.034 All the laudatory genius of the nation was in this only sentence.
033.035 Franz and Albert got off. The carriage approached the palace. Their Excellencies stretched out their legs on the benches, the cicerone jumped on the back seat.
033.036 "Where do Their Excellencies want us to take them?
033.037 --But first to St. Peter's and then to the Coliseum," said Albert, a true Parisian.
033.038 But Albert did not know one thing: it takes a day to see St. Peter's and a month to study it.
033.039 Suddenly, the two friends realized that the day was getting shorter.
033.040 Franz pulled out his watch; it was half past four.
033.041 They immediately went back to the hotel. At the door, Franz ordered the coachman to be ready at eight o'clock. He wanted to show Albert the Colosseum in the moonlight, as he had shown him St. Peter's in broad daylight. When one makes see to a friend a city which one already saw, one puts there the same coquetry as to show a woman of which one was the lover.
033.042 Consequently, Franz traced to the coachman his route; he was to leave by the door del Popolo, to skirt the external wall and to return by the door San-Giovanni. Thus the Colosseum appeared to them without any preparation, and without the Capitol, the Forum, the Arch of Septimius Severus, the temple of Antoninus and Faustina and the Via Sacra having served as steps placed on his route to make it smaller.
033.043 They sat down to table: Master Pastrini had promised his guests an excellent feast; he gave them a passable dinner: there was nothing to say.
033.044 At the end of the dinner, he entered himself: Franz believed at first that it was to receive his compliments and was about to pay them to him, when at the first words he interrupted him:
033.045 "Excellency," he said, "I am flattered by your approval; but it was not for that reason that I had gone up to your house....
033.046 --Was it to tell us that you had found a car?" asked Albert, lighting his cigar.
033.047 -- Still less, and even, Excellency, you will do well to forget about it and take your side. In Rome, things may or may not happen. When you have been told that they cannot be done, it is over.
033.048 -- In Paris, it is much more convenient: when it is not possible, you pay double and you get what you want right away.
033.049 -- I hear that from all the French, said Master Pastrini a little stung, which makes me not understand how they travel.
033.050 --But also, said Albert, phlegmatically pushing his smoke to the ceiling and tipping himself over balanced on the two back legs of his armchair, it is the fools and fools like us who travel; the sensible people do not leave their hotel in the Rue du Helder, the Boulevard de Gand and the Café de Paris."
033.051 It goes without saying that Albert lived in the aforementioned street, took his fashionable walk every day, and dined daily in the only café where one dines, when, however, one is on good terms with the boys.
033.052 Master Pastrini remained a moment silent, it was evident that he meditated the answer, which without doubt did not seem to him perfectly clear.
033.053 "But finally," said Franz in his turn, interrupting the geographical reflections of his host, "you had come for some purpose; would you like to tell us the object of your visit?
033.054 --Ah, that's right; here it is: you ordered the carriage for eight o'clock?
033.055 --Perfectly.
033.056 --Do you intend to visit the Colosseum?
033.057 --That is, the Colosseum?
033.058 --That's exactly the same thing.
033.059 --So.
033.060 --You told your coachman to go out through the Porta del Popolo, go around the walls and return through the Porta San Giovanni?
033.061 --These are my own words.
033.062 --Well, that route is impossible.
033.063 --Impossible!
033.064 --Or at least very dangerous.
033.065 --Dangerous! And why?
033.066 -- Because of the famous Luigi Vampa.
033.067 --First of all, my dear host, what is the famous Luigi Vampa? asked Albert; he may be very famous in Rome, but I warn you that he is unknown in Paris.
033.068 --How can you not know him?
033.069 -- I do not have that honor.
033.070 --You have never heard his name pronounced?
033.071 -- Never.
033.072 --Well, he's a bandit with whom the Deseraris and the Gasparones are like altar boys.
033.073 --Watch out, Albert!" exclaimed Franz, "here is a bandit at last!
033.074 -- I warn you, my dear host, that I will not believe a word you say. This point is settled between us, speak as much as you like, I am listening. "There was once..." Well, go on then!"
033.075 Master Pastrini turned to Franz, who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two young men. It is necessary to give justice to the good man: he had accommodated many Frenchmen in his life, but he had never understood certain side of their spirit.
033.076 "Excellency," he said very gravely, addressing himself, as we have said, to Franz, "if you regard me as a liar, it is useless for me to tell you what I wanted to tell you; I can, however, tell you that it was in the interest of Your Excellencies.
033.077 - "Albert is not telling you that you are a liar, my dear Mr. Pastrini," continued Franz, "he is telling you that he will not believe you, that is all. But I will believe you, so don't worry; just talk.
033.078 -However, Excellency, you understand that if my veracity is questioned...
033.079 -My dear," Franz continued, "you are more susceptible than Cassandra, who was a prophetess, and to whom no one listened; whereas you, at least, are sure of half your audience. Come, sit down, and tell us what Mr. Vampa is.
033.080 --I have told you, Excellency, he is a bandit, such as we have not seen since the famous Mastrilla.
033.081 --Well, what has this bandit to do with the order I gave my coachman to go out through the Popolo Gate and return through the San Giovanni Gate?
033.082 -- There is," replied Master Pastrini, "that you can go out by the one, but I doubt that you will return by the other.
033.083 --Why is that?" asked Franz.
033.084 --Because, when night comes, it is no longer safe to be fifty steps from the doors.
033.085 --Honor? cried Albert.
033.086 --Monsieur le vicomte, said Master Pastrini, still wounded to the core of the heart of the doubt expressed by Albert on his veracity, what I say is not for you, it is for your companion of voyage, who knows Rome, him, and who knows that one does not trifle with these things.
033.087 -My dear, says Albert addressing Franz, here is an admirable adventure all found: we fill our carriage with pistols, blunderbusses and double guns. Luigi Vampa comes to arrest us, we arrest him. We bring him back to Rome; we pay tribute to His Holiness, who asks us what he can do to recognize such a great service. Then we claim purely and simply a carriage and two horses from his stables, and we see the carnival in the carriage; not to mention that probably the Roman people, grateful, crown us at the Capitol and proclaim us, like Curtius and Horatius Cocles, the saviors of the fatherland."
033.088 While Albert was deducing this proposition, Master Pastrini was making a figure that one would try in vain to describe.
033.089 "And first of all," Franz asked Albert, "where will you take these pistols, these blunderbusses, these double-barrelled rifles with which you want to stuff your car?
033.090 --The fact is that it will not be in my arsenal, he said, because at the Terracina, they took even my dagger knife; and to you?
033.091 --The same was done to me at Aqua-Pendente.
033.092 --Ah, my dear host," said Albert, lighting his second cigar with the rest of his first, "do you know that this measure is very convenient for thieves, and that it seems to me to have been taken in half-count with them?"
033.093 No doubt Master Pastrini found the joke compromising, for he only half-answered it, and then only by addressing Franz, as the only reasonable person with whom he could properly get along.
033.094 "His Excellency knows that it is not customary to defend oneself when one is attacked by bandits.
033.095 --How!" exclaimed Albert, whose courage revolted at the idea of allowing himself to be robbed without saying anything; "how! it is not usual?
033.096 --No, for any defense would be useless. What do you want to do against a dozen bandits who come out of a ditch, a hovel, or an aqueduct, and lay you at gunpoint all at once?
033.097 -- "Oh, my goodness, I want to be killed!" cried Albert.
033.098 The innkeeper turned to Franz with an air that meant to say: Decidedly, Excellency, your comrade is mad.
033.099 "My dear Albert," said Franz, "your answer is sublime, and is worth the _Qu'il mourût_ of old Corneille: only, when Horace answered that, it was about the salvation of Rome, and the thing was worth it. But as for us, notice that it is simply a question of a whim to be satisfied, and that it would be ridiculous, for a whim, to risk our life.
033.100 --Ah! _per Bacco_!" cried Master Pastrini, "that's what is called talking."
033.101 Albert poured himself a glass of _lacryma Christi_, which he drank in small gulps, muttering unintelligible words.
033.102 "Well, Master Pastrini," resumed Franz, "now that my companion has been calmed, and you have been able to appreciate my peaceful disposition, now let us see what the lord Luigi Vampa is? Is he a shepherd or a patrician? Is he young or old? Describe him to us, so that if we meet him by chance in the world, like John Sbogar or Lara, we can at least recognize him.
033.103 --You can't do better than to ask me, Excellency, for exact details, because I knew Luigi Vampa when I was a child; and, one day when I had fallen into his hands myself, on my way from Ferentino to Alatri, he remembered, fortunately for me, our old acquaintance; he let me go, not only without ransoming me, but also after having given me a very beautiful watch and having told me his story
033.104 -- Let's see the watch," said Albert.
033.105 Master Pastrini drew from his pocket a magnificent Breguet bearing the name of its author, the stamp of Paris and a count's crown.
033.106 "Here," he said.
033.107 --Perish!" said Albert, "I compliment you on it; I have one just like it--he pulled his watch from his vest pocket--and it cost me three thousand francs.
033.108 --Let's see the story," said Franz in turn, pulling out an armchair and motioning to Master Pastrini to sit down.
033.109 --Their Excellencies allow? said the host.
033.110 --Pardon!" said Albert, "you are not a preacher, my dear, to speak standing up."
033.111 The host sat down, after having given each of his future listeners a respectful bow, which was intended to indicate that he was ready to give them the information about Luigi Vampa that they requested.
033.112 "Oh," said Franz, stopping Master Pastrini as he opened his mouth, "you say that you knew Luigi Vampa as a child; is he still a young man?
033.113 - "What do you mean, a young man? I think so; he is barely twenty-two! Oh! he is a stout fellow who will go far, be assured!
033.114 --What do you say to that, Albert? It's nice, at twenty-two, to have already made a reputation for yourself," said Franz.
033.115 --Yes, certainly, and, at his age, Alexander, Caesar and Napoleon, who have since made a certain noise in the world, were not so advanced as he.
033.116 -- So, Franz continued, addressing his host, the hero whose story we are about to hear is only twenty-two years old.
033.117 -- Barely, as I had the honor of telling you.
033.118 -- Is he tall or short?
033.119 --Medium height: about the same as His Excellency, said the host, pointing to Albert.
033.120 --Thank you for the comparison, said the latter, bowing.
033.121 - "Go on, Master Pastrini," said Franz, smiling at his friend's susceptibility. And to what class of society did he belong?
033.122 -He was a simple little shepherd attached to the farm of the Count of San-Felice, situated between Palestrina and the lake of Gabri. He had been born in Pampinara, and at the age of five had entered the service of the count. His father, a shepherd himself in Anagni, had a small flock of his own; and he lived on the wool of his sheep and the harvest made from the milk of his sheep, which he came to sell in Rome.
033.123 "As a child, little Vampa had a strange character. One day, when he was seven years old, he came to the parish priest of Palestrina and asked him to teach him to read. It was a difficult thing to do, because the young shepherd could not leave his flock. But the good priest went every day to say mass in a poor little village too small to pay a priest, and which, not having a name, was known as dell'Borgo. He offered to meet Luigi on his way back and give him his lesson, warning him that the lesson would be short and that he should therefore take advantage of it.
033.124 "The child gladly accepted.
033.125 "Every day Luigi led his flock along the road from Palestrina to the Borgo; every day at nine o'clock in the morning the priest passed by, the priest and the child sat down on the side of a ditch, and the little shepherd took his lesson from the priest's breviary.
033.126 "After three months he could read.
033.127 "That was not all, he now had to learn to write.
033.128 "The priest had a writing teacher from Rome make three alphabets: one large, one medium, and one small, and he showed him that by following this alphabet on a slate he could, with the help of an iron point, learn to write.
033.129 "That same evening, when the herd had returned to the farm, little Vampa ran to the locksmith in Palestrina, took a large nail, forged it, hammered it, rounded it, and made a kind of antique stylus out of it.
033.130 "The next day he had gathered a supply of slates and set to work.
033.131 "After three months, he could write.
033.132 "The parish priest, astonished by this deep intelligence and touched by this aptitude, gave him several notebooks of paper, a packet of pens and a penknife.
033.133 "This was a new study for him to do, but a study that was nothing like the first. Eight days later, he was handling the pen as he handled the stylus.
033.134 "The parish priest told this anecdote to the Count of San Felice, who wanted to see the little shepherd, made him read and write in front of him, ordered his steward to make him eat with the servants, and gave him two piasters a month.
033.135 "With this money Luigi bought books and pencils.
033.136 "Indeed, he applied to all objects that facility for imitation which he had, and, like Giotto as a child, he drew on his slates his sheep, the trees, the houses.
033.137 "Then, with the point of his penknife, he began to carve wood and to give it all sorts of shapes. This is how Pinelli, the popular sculptor, had begun.
033.138 "A girl of six or seven, that is to say, a little younger than Vampa, kept sheep on a farm near Palestrina; she was an orphan, born in Valmontone, and her name was Teresa.
033.139 "The two children met, sat down next to each other, let their flocks mingle and graze together, chatted, laughed and played, and then, in the evening, the Count of San-Felice's sheep were separated from those of the Baron of Cervetri, and the children left each other to return to their respective farms, promising to meet again the next morning.
033.140 "The next day they kept their word, and thus grew up side by side.
033.141 "Vampa reached the age of twelve, and little Teresa eleven.
033.142 "However, their natural instincts were developing.
033.143 "Beside the taste for the arts, which Luigi had pushed as far as he could in isolation, he was sad by jest, ardent by jerk, angry by caprice, mocking always. None of the young boys from Pampinara, Palestrina or Valmontone could not only take any influence on him, but also become his companion. His willful temperament, always ready to demand without ever wanting to give in to any concession, kept away from him any friendly movement, any sympathetic demonstration. Teresa alone commanded with a word, a look, a gesture this whole character which bent under the hand of a woman, and which, under that of any man, would have stiffened until it broke.
033.144 "Teresa was, on the contrary, lively, alert and cheerful, but coquettish to excess, the two piastres given to Luigi by the steward of the Count of San-Felice, the price of all the small sculptured works he sold to the toy dealers of Rome, were spent on pearl earrings, glass necklaces, and gold needles. Also, thanks to this prodigality of his young friend, Teresa was the most beautiful and elegant peasant girl in the vicinity of Rome.
033.145 "The two children continued to grow up, spending all their days together, and giving themselves up without a fight to the instincts of their primitive nature. Also, in their conversations, in their wishes, in their dreams, Vampa always saw himself captain of a ship, general of an army, or governor of a province; Teresa saw herself rich, dressed in the most beautiful gowns and followed by servants in livery, and then, when they had spent the whole day embroidering their future with these crazy and brilliant arabesques, they would separate to take each of their sheep back to their barn, and descend, from the height of their dreams, to the humility of their real position.
033.146 "One day the young shepherd told the count's steward that he had seen a wolf come out of the Sabine mountains and prowl around his flock. The steward gave him a rifle: this is what Vampa wanted.
033.147 "This rifle happened to be an excellent Brescian gun, bearing the bullet like an English rifle; only one day the count, in stunning a wounded fox, had broken the stock and the rifle was thrown away.
033.148 "This was no difficulty for a sculptor like Vampa. He examined the primitive layer, calculated what had to be changed to make it fit his eye, and made another stock loaded with such marvelous ornaments that, if he had wanted to go to the city to sell the wood alone, he would certainly have made fifteen or twenty piastres.
033.149 "But he had no intention of doing so: a rifle had long been the young man's dream. In all countries where independence is substituted for liberty, the first need of every strong heart, of every powerful organization, is that of a weapon which assures at the same time attack and defense, and which makes the one who carries it terrible, often makes him feared.
033.150 "From that moment on, Vampa gave all the moments that remained to him to the exercise of the rifle; he bought powder and bullets, and everything became a goal for him: the trunk of the olive tree, sad, puny and gray, which grows on the slopes of the Sabine mountains; the fox which, in the evening, came out of its burrow to begin its nocturnal hunt, and the eagle which hovered in the air. Soon he became so skilful that Teresa overcame the fear she had felt at first on hearing the shot, and was amused to see her young companion place the ball of his rifle where he wanted to put it, with as much accuracy as if he had pushed it with his hand.
033.151 "One evening, a wolf did indeed come out of a fir-tree wood, near which the two young men were accustomed to stay: the wolf had not taken ten steps on the plain before he was dead.
033.152 "Vampa, very proud of this great achievement, loaded it on his shoulders and brought it back to the farm.
033.153 "All these details gave Luigi a certain reputation in the vicinity of the farm; the superior man wherever he is, creates a clientele of admirers. The young shepherd was spoken of in the vicinity as the most skilful, the strongest and the bravest contadino in the ten leagues around; and although Teresa, on her part, was known in an even wider circle as one of the prettiest girls in the Sabina, no one dared to say a word of love to her, for she was known to be loved by Vampa.
033.154 "And yet the two young people had never told each other that they loved each other. They had grown next to each other like two trees that mingle their roots under the ground, their branches in the air, their fragrance in the sky; only their desire to see each other was the same; this desire had become a need, and they understood death rather than a separation of a single day.
033.155 "Teresa was sixteen and Vampa seventeen.
033.156 "Around this time, there began to be much talk of a band of robbers who were organizing themselves in the Lepini mountains. The brigandage has never been seriously extirpated in the neighborhood of Rome. Sometimes it lacks leaders, but when a leader shows up, he rarely lacks a band.
033.157 "The famous Cucumetto, hunted in Abruzzo from the kingdom of Naples, where he had supported a real war, had crossed Garigliano like Manfred, and had come between Sonnino and Juperno to take refuge on the banks of the Amasine.
033.158 "It was he who was busy reorganizing a troop, and who was following in the footsteps of Decesaris and Gasparone, whom he hoped soon to surpass. Several young men of Palestrina, Frascati and Pampinara disappeared. At first people were worried about them, but soon it became known that they had gone to join Cucumetto's band.
033.159 "After some time, Cucumetto became the object of general attention. The leader of the bandits was cited for his extraordinary audacity and revolting brutality.
033.160 "One day he kidnapped a young girl: she was the daughter of the surveyor of Frosinone. The laws of the bandits are positive: a girl belongs to the one who first kidnaps her, then the others draw lots for her, and the unfortunate girl serves the pleasures of the whole troop until the bandits abandon her or she dies.
033.161 "When the parents are rich enough to ransom her, a messenger is sent to deal with the ransom; the prisoner's head answers for the safety of the emissary. If the ransom is refused, the prisoner is irrevocably condemned.
033.162 "The girl had her lover in the troop of Cucumetto: he was called Carlini.
033.163 "Recognizing the young man, she stretched out her arms to him and thought she was saved. But poor Carlini, recognizing her, felt his heart break, because he suspected well the fate which awaited his mistress.
033.164 "However, since he was Cucumetto's favorite, since he had shared his dangers for three years, since he had saved his life by shooting a carabiniere who already had his sword raised at his head, he hoped that Cucumetto would have some pity on him.
033.165 "So he took the chief aside, while the girl, seated against the trunk of a great pine tree that rose in the middle of a clearing in the forest, had made herself a veil of the picturesque headdress of the Roman peasant women and hid her face from the lustful eyes of the bandits.
033.166 "There he told her everything, his love affair with the prisoner, their oaths of fidelity, and how every night, since they had been in the vicinity, they had rendezvoused in a ruin.
033.167 "Just that evening Cucumetto had sent Carlini to a neighboring village, he had been unable to make the rendezvous; but Cucumetto had been there by chance, he said, and it was then that he had kidnapped the girl.
033.168 "Carlini begged his chief to make an exception in his favor and to respect Rita, telling him that the father was rich and that he would pay a good ransom.
033.169 "Cucumetto seemed to yield to the prayers of his friend, and charged him with finding a shepherd who could be sent to Rita's father in Frosinone.
033.170 "Then Carlini approached the girl joyfully, told her that she was saved, and invited her to write a letter to her father in which she told him what had happened to her, and announced that her ransom was fixed at three hundred piastres.
033.171 "The father was given twelve hours, that is, until nine o'clock the next morning, as a deadline.
033.172 "When the letter was written, Carlini took it at once and ran to the plain to look for a messenger.
033.173 "He found a young shepherd who was parking his flock. The natural messengers of bandits are shepherds, who live between the city and the mountain, between the wild and the civilized life.
033.174 "The young shepherd left at once, promising to be in Frosinone within the hour.
033.175 "Carlini returned joyfully to join his mistress and tell her the good news.
033.176 "He found the troop in the clearing, where it supped joyfully of the provisions that the bandits raised on the peasants as a tribute only; in the middle of these merry guests, he sought in vain Cucumetto and Rita.
033.177 "He asked where they were, the bandits answered with a great burst of laughter. A cold sweat ran down Carlini's forehead, and he felt the anguish that took him by the hair.
033.178 "He repeated his question. One of the guests filled a glass of Orvieto wine and handed it to him, saying:
033.179 "--To the health of the brave Cucumetto and the beautiful Rita!
033.180 "In this moment, Carlini believed to hear a cry of woman. He guessed everything. He took the glass, broke it on the face of the one who presented it to him, and ran in the direction of the cry.
033.181 "After a hundred steps, at the bend of a bush, he found Rita fainting in Cucumetto's arms.
033.182 "On seeing Carlini, Cucumetto stood up holding a pistol in each hand.
033.183 "The two bandits looked at each other for a moment: one with a smile of lust on his lips, the other with the pallor of death on his forehead.
033.184 "One would have thought that something terrible would happen between these two men. But little by little the features of Carlini relaxed, his hand, which he had carried to one of the pistols of his belt, fell down beside him hanging at his side.
033.185 "Rita was lying between them.
033.186 "The moon lit up this scene.
033.187 "--Well," said Cucumetto, "have you done the commission you were charged with?
033.188 "--Yes, Captain," replied Carlini, "and tomorrow, before nine o'clock, Rita's father will be here with the money.
033.189 "--Wonderful. In the meantime, we will spend a happy night. This girl is charming, and you have, in truth, good taste, Master Carlini. So, as I am not selfish, we will return to the comrades and draw lots to see who will own her now.
033.190 "--So you are decided to abandon it to the common law? asked Carlini.
033.191 "--And why should an exception be made in her favor?
033.192 "--I had believed that at my prayer ....
033.193 "--And what are you more than the others?
033.194 "--That's right.
033.195 "--But don't worry," said Cucumetto, laughing, "a little sooner, a little later, your turn will come.
033.196 "Carlini's teeth clenched to break.
033.197 "--Come on," said Cucumetto, taking a step towards the guests, "are you coming?
033.198 "--I follow you....
033.199 "Cucumetto moved away without losing sight of Carlini, because undoubtedly he feared that he would hit him from behind. But there was nothing in the bandit to indicate a hostile intention.
033.200 "He was standing with his arms crossed, near Rita, who was still unconscious.
033.201 "For a moment, Cucumetto's idea was that the young man was going to take her in his arms and flee with her. But he didn't care now, he had gotten from Rita what he wanted; and as for money, three hundred piastres distributed to the troop was such a poor sum that he cared little about it.
033.202 "So he continued on his way to the clearing; but, to his great surprise, Carlini arrived there almost as soon as he did.
033.203 "--The draw! the draw!" shouted all the bandits as they caught sight of the chief.
033.204 "And the eyes of all these men shone with drunkenness and lasciviousness, while the flame of the fireplace cast a reddish glow over their whole person that made them look like demons.
033.205 "What they asked for was just; so the chief nodded his head in agreement. All the names were put into a hat, Carlini's as well as those of the others, and the youngest of the band drew a ballot from the improvised box.
033.206 "This ballot paper bore the name of Diavolaccio.
033.207 "It was the same one who had offered Carlini the health of the chief, and to whom Carlini had replied by breaking the glass on his face.
033.208 "A large open wound from the temple to the mouth let blood flow freely.
033.209 "Diavolaccio, seeing himself thus favored by fortune, burst into laughter.
033.210 "--Captain," he said, "just now Carlini did not want to drink to your health; offer him to drink to mine; he will perhaps have more condescension for you than for me."
033.211 "Everyone expected an explosion from Carlini; but to the astonishment of all, he took a glass in one hand, a fiasco in the other, and then, filling the glass:
033.212 "--To your health, Diavolaccio," he said in a perfectly calm voice.
033.213 "And he swallowed the contents of the glass without his hand trembling. Then, sitting down by the fire:
033.214 "--My share of supper!" he said; "the run I have just made has given me an appetite.
033.215 "--Live Carlini!" cried the brigands.
033.216 "--That's what is called taking the thing in good company.
033.217 "And all reformed the circle around the hearth, while Diavolaccio moved away.
033.218 "Carlini ate and drank, as if nothing had happened.
033.219 "The bandits were looking at him with astonishment, understanding nothing of this impassivity, when they heard behind them the sound of a heavy step on the ground.
033.220 "They turned around and saw Diavolaccio holding the girl in his arms.
033.221 "She had her head turned back, and her long hair hung down to the ground.
033.222 "As they entered the circle of light projected by the hearth, the pallor of the girl and the pallor of the bandit became apparent.
033.223 "There was something so strange and solemn about this appearance that everyone rose to his feet, except Carlini, who remained seated and continued to eat and drink as if nothing were happening around him.
033.224 "Diavolaccio continued to advance in the midst of the deepest silence, and laid Rita at the captain's feet.
033.225 "Then everyone could recognize the cause of this pallor of the girl and of this pallor of the bandit: Rita had a knife stuck up to the handle below the left teat.
033.226 "All eyes went to Carlini: the sheath was empty on his belt.
033.227 "--Ah! ah!" said the chief, "I understand now why Carlini had stayed behind.
033.228 "All savage natures are apt to appreciate a strong action; although perhaps none of the bandits had done what Carlini had just done, all understood what he had done.
033.229 "--Well," said Carlini, rising in his turn and approaching the corpse, his hand on the butt of one of his pistols, "is there still someone who disputes this woman with me?
033.230 "--No," said the chief, "she is yours!"
033.231 "Then Carlini in turn took her in his arms, and carried her out of the circle of light which the flame of the fireplace projected.
033.232 "Cucumetto arranged the sentries as usual, and the bandits lay down, wrapped in their cloaks, around the fireplace.
033.233 "At midnight the sentry gave the alarm, and in an instant the chief and his companions were on their feet.
033.234 "It was Rita's father, who was arriving himself, carrying the ransom for his daughter.
033.235 "-Here, he said to Cucumetto, handing him a bag of money, here are three hundred pistols, give me back my child.
033.236 "But the chief, without taking the money, beckoned him to follow him. The old man obeyed; both went away under the trees, through whose branches the rays of the moon filtered. Finally Cucumetto stopped, extending his hand and showing the old man two people grouped at the foot of a tree:
033.237 "-Here," he said to him, "ask Carlini for your daughter; he will give you an account.
033.238 "And he returned to his companions.
033.239 "The old man remained motionless with his eyes fixed. He felt that some unknown, immense, unheard-of misfortune was hanging over his head.
033.240 "Finally, he took a few steps toward the shapeless group of which he could not be aware.
033.241 "At the noise he made as he advanced toward him, Carlini raised his head, and the forms of the two figures began to appear more distinct to the old man's eyes.
033.242 "A woman was lying on the ground, her head resting on the knees of a seated man who was leaning toward her; it was when he got up that this man discovered the face of the woman he was holding close to his chest.
033.243 "The old man recognized his daughter, and Carlini recognized the old man.
033.244 "--I was waiting for you," said the bandit to Rita's father.
033.245 "--Miserable!" said the old man, "what have you done?
033.246 "And he looked with terror at Rita, pale, motionless, bloody, with a knife in her chest.
033.247 "A ray of the moon struck on her and lit her up with its pallid glow.
033.248 "--Cucumetto had raped your daughter, said the bandit, and, as I loved her, I killed her; for, after him, she was going to serve as a plaything for the whole band.
033.249 "The old man did not utter a word, only turned pale as a ghost.
033.250 "--Now, said Carlini, if I was wrong, avenge her.
033.251 "And he tore the knife from the girl's breast and, rising, went to offer it with one hand to the old man while with the other he spread his jacket and presented him with his bare chest.
033.252 "-You have done well, said the old man in a dull voice. Kiss me, my son.
033.253 "Carlini threw himself, sobbing, into the arms of the father of his mistress. These were the first tears that this man of blood shed.
033.254 "--Now, said the old man to Carlini, help me bury my daughter.
033.255 "Carlini fetched two pickaxes, and the father and the lover began to dig the earth at the foot of an oak tree whose bushy branches were to cover the grave of the young girl.
033.256 "When the grave was dug, the father kissed her first, then the lover; then, one taking her by the feet, the other under the shoulders, they lowered her into the grave.
033.257 "Then they knelt down on both sides and said the prayers of the dead.
033.258 "Then, when they had finished, they pushed the earth back over the corpse until the grave was filled.
033.259 "Then, holding out his hand to her
033.260 "--I thank you, my son!" said the old man to Carlini; now leave me alone.
033.261 "--But still... said the latter.
033.262 "--Leave me, I order you.
033.263 "Carlini obeyed, went to join his comrades, wrapped himself in his coat, and soon appeared as deeply asleep as the others.
033.264 "It had been decided the day before that we would change camp.
033.265 "An hour before daylight Cucumetto woke his men and the order was given to leave.
033.266 "But Carlini did not want to leave the forest without knowing what had become of Rita's father.
033.267 "He went to the place where he had left him.
033.268 "He found the old man hanging from one of the branches of the oak tree that shaded his daughter's grave.
033.269 "He then swore over the corpse of the one and over the grave of the other that he would avenge them both.
033.270 "But he could not keep this oath; for, two days later in an encounter with the Roman carabinieri, Carlini was killed.
033.271 "Only, one was surprised that, facing the enemy, he had received a bullet between the two shoulders.
033.272 "The astonishment ceased when one of the bandits pointed out to his comrades that Cucumetto was ten steps behind Carlini when Carlini fell.
033.273 "On the morning of the departure from the forest of Frosinone, he had followed Carlini in the dark, had heard the oath he had taken, and, as a man of precaution, had taken the lead.
033.274 "Ten other stories, no less curious than this one, were told about this terrible leader.
033.275 "Thus, from Fondi to Perugia, everyone trembled at the name of Cucumetto.
033.276 "These stories had often been the subject of Luigi and Teresa's conversations.
033.277 "The girl trembled greatly at all these stories; but Vampa would reassure her with a smile, striking his good rifle, which carried the bullet so well; then, if she was not reassured, he would show her a hundred paces away some crow perched on a dead branch, point it at him, release the trigger, and the animal, struck, would fall to the foot of the tree.
033.278 "Nevertheless, time passed: the two young men had decided that they would marry when they were twenty years old, Vampa, and Teresa nineteen.
033.279 "They were both orphans; they had no permission to ask except from their master; they had asked for it and obtained it.
033.280 "One day while they were talking about their future plans, they heard two or three shots; then suddenly a man came out of the woods near which the two young men were in the habit of grazing their flocks, and ran towards them.
033.281 "Arrived within earshot:
033.282 "--I am being pursued!" he shouted at them; "can you hide me?
033.283 "The two young men recognized that this fugitive must be some bandit; but there is between the peasant and the Roman bandit an innate sympathy which makes the first always ready to do the second a favor.
033.284 "Vampa, therefore, without saying anything, ran to the stone which blocked the entrance to their cave, unmasked this entrance by pulling the stone to himself, beckoned the fugitive to take refuge in this asylum unknown to all, pushed the stone back over him, and returned to sit down near Teresa.
033.285 "Almost immediately, four mounted carabinieri appeared at the edge of the woods; three appeared to be searching for the fugitive, the fourth was dragging a captive bandit by the neck.
033.286 "The three carabinieri explored the country at a glance, saw the two young men, ran to them at full gallop, and questioned them.
033.287 "They had seen nothing.
033.288 "-That's unfortunate," said the brigadier, "because the one we are looking for is the chief.
033.289 "--Cucumetto?" exclaimed Luigi and Teresa together.
033.290 "--Yes," replied the brigadier; and as there is a price on his head of a thousand Roman ecus, there would have been five hundred for you if you had helped us to take him.
033.291 "The two young men exchanged a glance. The brigadier had a moment of hope. Five hundred Roman ecus is three thousand francs, and three thousand francs is a fortune for two poor orphans who are going to get married.
033.292 "--Yes, it is unfortunate," said Vampa, "but we have not seen it.
033.293 "Then the carabinieri beat the country in different directions, but uselessly.
033.294 "Then, successively, they disappeared.
033.295 "Then Vampa went to pull the stone, and Cucumetto went out.
033.296 "He had seen, through the days of the granite door, the two young men talking with the carabinieri; he had suspected the subject of their conversation, he had read on the faces of Luigi and Teresa the unshakeable resolution not to hand him over, and he drew from his pocket a purse full of gold and offered it to them.
033.297 "But Vampa raised his head with pride; as for Teresa, her eyes shone as she thought of all the rich jewels and beautiful clothes she could buy with that purse full of gold.
033.298 "Cucumetto was a very clever Satan: he had taken the form of a bandit instead of a snake; he surprised this look, recognized in Teresa a worthy daughter of Eve, and returned to the forest, turning around several times on the pretext of greeting his liberators.
033.299 "Several days passed without Cucumetto being seen or heard from again.
033.300 "The time of the carnival approached. The Count of San Felice announced a great masked ball to which all that Rome had of more elegant was invited.
033.301 "Teresa wanted to see this ball. Luigi asked his protector the intendant for permission for her and for him to attend it hidden among the servants of the house. This permission was granted.
033.302 "This ball was especially given by the count to please his daughter Carmela, whom he adored.
033.303 "Carmela was just the right age and height for Teresa, and Teresa was at least as beautiful as Carmela.
033.304 "On the evening of the ball, Teresa put on her most beautiful toilet, her richest needles, her most brilliant glassware. She had the costume of the women of Frascati.
033.305 "Luigi had the so picturesque dress of the Roman peasant on the days of festival.
033.306 "Both mixed, as it had been allowed, with the servants and the peasants.
033.307 "The feast was magnificent. Not only was the villa brightly illuminated, but thousands of colored lanterns hung from the trees in the garden. So soon the palace overflowed onto the terraces and the terraces into the alleys.
033.308 "At each crossroads there was an orchestra, buffets and refreshments; the walkers stopped, quadrilles were formed and one danced where it pleased to dance.
033.309 "Carmela was dressed as a woman of Sonino. She had her bonnet all embroidered with pearls, the needles of her hair were of gold and diamonds, her belt was of Turkish silk with large embroidered flowers, her surtout and her petticoat were of cashmere, her apron was of muslin of the Indies; the buttons of her corset were as many gems.
033.310 "Two other of her companions were dressed, one in woman of Nettuno, the other in woman of Riccia.
033.311 "Four young men of the richest and noblest families of Rome accompanied them with that Italian freedom which has its equal in no other country of the world: they were dressed on their side as peasants of Albano, of Velletri, of Civita-Castellana and of Sora.
033.312 "It goes without saying that these costumes of peasants, like those of peasant women, were resplendent with gold and gems.
033.313 "It came to Carmela the idea to make a uniform quadrille, only it lacked a woman.
033.314 "Carmela looked around, not one of her guests had a costume similar to hers and those of her companions.
033.315 "Count San-Felice showed her, among the peasant women, Teresa leaning on Luigi's arm.
033.316 "--Do you mind, Father?" said Carmela.
033.317 "--Surely," replied the Count, "this is not Carnival!
033.318 "Carmela leaned toward a young man who was accompanying her in conversation, and said a few words to him while pointing to the girl.
033.319 "The young man followed with his eyes the pretty hand that served as his guide, made a gesture of obedience and came to invite Teresa to appear in the quadrille led by the daughter of the count.
033.320 "Teresa felt as if a flame was passing over her face. She questioned Luigi with her eyes: there was no way she could refuse. Luigi slowly let Teresa's arm slip from under his, and Teresa, led away by her elegant rider, came to take her place, trembling, in the aristocratic quadrille.
033.321 "Certainly, in the eyes of an artist, Teresa's exact and severe costume would have had a much different character than that of Carmela and her companions, but Teresa was a frivolous and coquettish girl; the embroidery of the muslin, the palms of the belt, the brilliance of the cashmere dazzled her, the reflection of the sapphires and diamonds drove her mad.
033. 322 "On his side Luigi felt born in him an unknown feeling: it was like a dull pain which bit him in the heart at first, and from there, all quivering, ran by his veins and took possession of all his body; he followed with the eyes the least movements of Teresa and her rider; when their hands touched he felt like dazzling, his arteries beat with violence, and one would have said that the sound of a bell vibrated in his ears. When they spoke to each other, although Teresa listened, shy and with lowered eyes, to the speeches of her cavalier, as Luigi read in the ardent eyes of the handsome young man that these speeches were praises, it seemed to him that the earth was turning under him and that all the voices of hell were blowing to him ideas of murder and assassination. Then, fearing to be carried away by his madness, he clung with one hand to the bower against which he was standing, and with the other he clutched with a convulsive movement the dagger with the carved handle which was passed through his belt and which, without realizing it, he sometimes drew almost whole from the scabbard.
033.323 "Luigi was jealous! He felt that, carried away by her coquettish and proud nature, Teresa could escape him.
033.324 "And yet the young peasant girl, shy and almost frightened at first, had soon recovered. We have said that Teresa was beautiful. Not only that, Teresa was graceful, with a wild grace that is far more powerful than our shabby, affected grace.
033.325 "She almost had the honors of the quadrille, and if she was envious of the daughter of the Count of San-Felice, we would not dare say that Carmela was not jealous of her.
033.326 "And so it was with many compliments that her handsome rider led her back to the place where he had taken her, and where Luigi was waiting.
033.327 "Two or three times, during the contredanse, the young girl had glanced at him, and each time she had seen him pale and with strained features. Once even the blade of his knife, half drawn from its sheath, had dazzled her eyes like a sinister flash.
033.328 "It was thus almost while trembling that she took again the arm of her lover.
033.329 "The quadrille had had the greatest success, and it was obvious that it was question of making a second edition of it; Carmela alone was opposed to it; but the count of San-Felice begged his daughter so tenderly, that she finally consented.
033.330 "Immediately one of the riders came forward to invite Teresa, without whom it was impossible for the contredanse to take place; but the girl had already disappeared.
033.331 "Indeed, Luigi had not felt strong enough to endure a second trial; and, half by persuasion, half by force, he had dragged Teresa to another point in the garden. Teresa had yielded in spite of herself; but she had seen the young man's upset face, she understood from his silence interspersed with nervous twitches, that something strange was going on inside him. She herself was not free from an inner turmoil, and without having done anything wrong, she understood that Luigi was entitled to reproach her: about what? she did not know; but she felt no less that these reproaches would be deserved.
033.332 "However, to Teresa's great astonishment, Luigi remained mute, and not a word did he utter for the rest of the evening. Only when the cold of the night had driven the guests from the gardens and the doors of the villa had closed on them for an inner party, he led Teresa away; then, as she was about to go home:
033.333 "--Teresa," he said, "what were you thinking of when you were dancing opposite the young Countess of San-Felice?
033.334 "--I was thinking," answered the girl in all the frankness of her soul, "that I would give half my life to have a costume like the one she wore.
033.335 "--And what did your date say to you?
033.336 "--He was telling me that it would be up to me to have her, and that I had only one word to say for it.
033.337 "--He was right," replied Luigi. Do you want it as much as you say you do?
033.338 "--Yes.
033.339 "--Well, you'll have it!
033.340 "The young girl, astonished, raised her head to question him; but her face was so dark and terrible that the word froze on her lips.
033.341 "Moreover, as he said these words, Luigi had moved away.
033.342 "Teresa followed him with her eyes in the night as long as she could see him. Then, when he had disappeared, she returned home with a sigh.
033.343 "That same night, a great event occurred, no doubt due to the imprudence of some servant who had neglected to turn off the lights; fire broke out in the villa San-Felice, right in the outbuildings of the apartment of the beautiful Carmela. Awakened in the middle of the night by the glow of the flames, she had jumped out of bed, wrapped herself in her robe, and tried to escape through the door; but the corridor through which she had to pass was already prey to the fire. Then she had returned to her room, crying out for help, when suddenly her window, twenty feet above the ground, opened; a young peasant rushed into the apartment, took her in his arms, and with superhuman strength and skill carried her to the lawn, where she fainted. When she had regained her senses, her father was standing before her. All the servants were surrounding her, bringing help. A whole wing of the villa was burned; but what did it matter, since Carmela was safe and sound.
033.344 "They looked everywhere for her liberator, but her liberator did not appear; they asked everyone for him, but no one had seen him. As for Carmela, she was so confused that she had not recognized him.
033.345 "Besides, as the Count was immensely rich, apart from the danger which Carmela had run, and which seemed to him, by the miraculous way in which she had escaped it, rather a new favor of Providence than a real misfortune, the loss caused by the flames was of little consequence to him.
033.346 "The next day, at the usual time, the two young men met at the edge of the forest. Luigi had arrived first. He came to meet the girl with great gaiety; he seemed to have completely forgotten the scene of the day before. Teresa was visibly pensive, but on seeing Luigi thus disposed, she affected on her side the laughing insouciance which was the bottom of her character when some passion did not come to disturb it.
033.347 "Luigi took Teresa's arm under his, and led her to the door of the cave. There he stopped. The girl, realizing that something extraordinary was going on, looked at him fixedly.
033.348 "--Teresa," said Luigi, "last night you told me that you would give anything in the world to have a costume like that of the Count's daughter?
033.349 "--Yes," said Teresa, with astonishment, "but I was mad to make such a wish.
033.350 "--And I said to you: 'That's fine, you'll have it.
033.351 "--Yes," said the girl, whose astonishment grew with every word Luigi said; "but you probably answered that to please me.
033.352 "--I have never promised you anything that I have not given you, Teresa," said Luigi proudly; "go into the cave and get dressed.
033.353 "At these words he drew the stone, and showed Teresa the grotto lighted by two candles burning on either side of a magnificent mirror; on the rustic table, made by Luigi, were spread the pearl necklace and the diamond pins; on a chair beside it was laid the rest of the costume.
033.354 "Teresa gave a cry of joy, and, without inquiring where the costume had come from, without taking the time to thank Luigi, she rushed into the cave transformed into a toilet.
033.355 "Behind her Luigi pushed back the stone, for he had just seen, on the crest of a small hill which prevented Palestrina from being seen from the place where he was, a traveler on horseback, who stopped for a moment as if uncertain of his route, drawing himself on the blue sky with that sharpness of outline peculiar to the distant lands of the south.
033.356 "On seeing Luigi, the traveler put his horse into a gallop and came to him.
033.357 "Luigi had not been mistaken; the traveler, who was going from Palestrina to Tivoli, was in doubt of his way.
033.358 "The young man indicated it to him; but, as at a quarter of a mile from there the road divided in three paths, and that arrived at these three paths the traveler could again be mislaid, he begged Luigi to serve him as guide.
033.359 "Luigi untied his cloak and laid it on the ground, threw his rifle over his shoulder, and, thus freed from the heavy garment, walked ahead of the traveler with that quick step of the mountaineer that the step of a horse can hardly follow.
033.360 "In ten minutes Luigi and the traveler were at the sort of crossroads indicated by the young shepherd.
033.361 "When they arrived there, with a majestic gesture like that of an emperor, he extended his hand toward the one of the three roads that the traveler was to follow:
033.362 "--There is your path, he said, Excellency, you need not go wrong now.
033.363 "--And you, here is your reward," said the traveler, offering the young shepherd some small coins.
033.364 "--Thank you," said Luigi, withdrawing his hand; "I am doing a service, not selling it.
033.365 "--But," said the traveler, who seemed accustomed to this difference between the servility of the city man and the pride of the countryman, "if you refuse a wage, you at least accept a gift.
033.366 "--Ah, yes, that's another thing.
033.367 "--Well," said the traveler, "take these two Venetian sequins and give them to your fiancée to make a pair of earrings.
033.368 "--And you, then, take this dagger, said the young shepherd, you would not find one with a better carved handle from Albano to Civita-Castellana.
033.369 "--I accept, said the traveler; but then, it is I who am your debtor, for this dagger is worth more than two sequins.
033.370 "--For a merchant perhaps, but for me, who carved it myself, it is hardly worth a piaster.
033.371 "--How do you call yourself?" asked the traveler.
033.372 "--Luigi Vampa," replied the shepherd with the same air as if he had answered: "Alexander, king of Macedonia. And you?
033.373 "--Me," said the traveler, "my name is Simbad the sailor.
033.374 Franz d'Épinay gave a cry of surprise.
033.375 "Simbad the sailor!" he said.
033.376 --Yes," continued the narrator, "that is the name the traveler gave Vampa as his own.
033.377 --Well, what do you have to say against that name?" interrupted Albert; "it's a very beautiful name, and the adventures of this gentleman's boss, I must confess, amused me greatly in my youth.
033.378 Franz did not insist further. This name of Simbad the sailor, as is well understood, had awakened in him a whole world of memories, as had done the day before that of the Count of Monte Cristo.
033.379 "Continue," he said to the host.
033.380 --Vampa disdainfully put the two sequins in his pocket, and slowly resumed the path by which he had come. When he arrived two or three hundred steps from the cave, he thought he heard a cry.
033.381 "He stopped, listening to which way the cry came from.
033.382 "After a second, he heard his name pronounced distinctly.
033.383 "The call came from the side of the cave.
033.384 "He leaped like a chamois, cocking his rifle as he ran, and in less than a minute reached the top of the hill opposite the one where he had seen the traveler.
033.385 "There the cries of 'Help!
033.386 "He cast his eyes over the space he was overlooking; a man was kidnapping Teresa, like the centaur Nessus Dejanira.
033.387 "This man, who was heading for the woods, was already three-quarters of the way from the cave to the forest.
033.388 "Vampa measured the interval; this man was at least two hundred steps ahead of him, there was no chance of catching up with him before he had reached the woods.
033.389 "The young shepherd stopped as if his feet had taken root. He pressed the butt of his rifle to his shoulder, slowly raised the barrel in the direction of the captor, followed him for a second and fired.
033.390 "The kidnapper stopped short; his knees buckled and he fell, taking Teresa with him.
033.391 "But Teresa got up at once; as for the fugitive, he remained lying down, struggling in the convulsions of agony.
033.392 "Vampa rushed at once to Teresa, for at ten paces from the dying man his legs had failed him in turn, and she had fallen back to her knees: the young man had this terrible fear that the bullet which had just shot his enemy had at the same time wounded his fiancée.
033.393 "Fortunately this was not the case; it was terror alone that had paralyzed Teresa's strength. When Luigi was sure that she was safe and sound, he turned back to the wounded man.
033.394 "He had just expired with clenched fists, his mouth contracted with pain, and his hair bristling with the sweat of agony.
033.395 "His eyes remained open and threatening.
033.396 "Vampa approached the corpse, and recognized Cucumetto.
033.397 "Since the day the bandit had been saved by the two young men, he had become in love with Teresa and had sworn that the girl would be his. Since that day he had spied on her; and, taking advantage of the moment when her lover had left her alone to show the way to the traveler, he had abducted her and already believed her to be his, when Vampa's bullet, guided by the infallible eye of the young shepherd boy, had passed through his heart.
033.398 "Vampa looked at him for a moment without the slightest emotion betraying itself on his face, while on the contrary Teresa, still trembling, only dared to approach the dead bandit with small steps, and hesitatingly glanced at the corpse over her lover's shoulder.
033.399 "After a moment, Vampa turned back to his mistress:
033.400 "--Ah! ah!" he said, "it is well, you are dressed; it is my turn to make my toilet.
033.401 "Indeed, Teresa was dressed from head to toe in the costume of the daughter of the Count of San Felice.
033.402 "Vampa took the body of Cucumetto between his arms, carried it into the cave, while Teresa in turn remained outside.
033.403 "If a second traveler had then passed by, he would have seen a strange thing: it was a shepherdess guarding her sheep with a cashmere dress, earrings and a pearl necklace, diamond pins and buttons of sapphires, emeralds and rubies.
033.404 "Without a doubt, he would have thought himself back in Florian's time, and would have affirmed, on returning to Paris, that he had met the shepherdess of the Alps sitting at the foot of the Sabine mountains.
033.405 "At the end of a quarter of an hour, Vampa left the cave in his turn. His costume was not less elegant, in its kind, than that of Teresa.
033. 406 "He had a garnet velvet jacket with chiseled gold buttons, a silk vest all covered with embroidery, a Roman scarf tied around his neck, a cartridge belt all stitched with gold and red and green silk; breeches of sky-blue velvet tied below the knee with diamond buckles, buckskin gaiters decorated with a thousand arabesques, and a hat with ribbons of all colors; two watches hung from his belt, and a magnificent dagger was passed to his cartridge belt.
033.407 "Teresa gave a cry of admiration. Vampa, under that garb, looked like a painting by Leopold Robert or Schnetz.
033.408 "He had put on the full costume of Cucumetto.
033.409 "The young man noticed the effect he was having on his fiancée, and a smile of pride passed over his mouth.
033.410 "--Now," he said to Teresa, "are you ready to share my fortune, whatever it may be?
033.411 "--Oh yes!" exclaimed the girl enthusiastically.
033.412 "--To follow me wherever I go?
033.413 "--At the end of the world.
033.414 "--Then take my arm and let's go, for we have no time to lose."
033.415 "The girl passed her arm under that of her lover, without even asking him where he was leading her; for, at that moment, he seemed to her beautiful, proud, and powerful like a god.
033.416 "And both of them advanced into the forest, of which after a few minutes they had crossed the edge.
033.417 "It goes without saying that all the paths of the mountain were known to Vampa; he therefore advanced into the forest without hesitating for a moment, although there was no clear path, but only recognizing the route he had to follow by the mere inspection of the trees and bushes; they walked thus for about an hour and a half.
033.418 "At the end of this time they had arrived at the thickest part of the wood. A stream whose bed was dry led into a deep gorge. Vampa took this strange path, which, wedged between two banks and darkened by the thick shade of the pines, seemed, minus the easy descent, that path of the Averno of which Virgil speaks.
033.419 "Teresa, once again fearful at the aspect of this wild and deserted place, clutched her guide, without saying a word; but as she saw him walking always with an equal step, as a deep calm radiated on his face, she herself had the strength to conceal her emotion.
033.420 "Suddenly, at ten paces from them, a man seemed to detach himself from a tree behind which he was hidden, and put Vampa at gunpoint:
033.421 "--Not another step!" he shouted, "or you are dead.
033.422 "--Let's go," said Vampa, raising his hand with a gesture of contempt; while Teresa, no longer concealing her terror, pressed herself against him, "do wolves tear each other apart!
033.423 "--Who are you?" asked the sentry.
033.424 "--I am Luigi Vampa, the shepherd of the farm of San-Felice.
033.425 "--What do you want?
033.426 "--I want to talk to your companions who are at the clearing of Rocca Bianca.
033.427 "--Then follow me, said the sentry, or rather, since you know where it is, walk ahead.
033.428 "Vampa smiled contemptuously at this precaution of the bandit, passed in front with Teresa and continued his way with the same firm and quiet step that had led him so far.
033.429 "After five minutes, the bandit signaled them to stop.
033.430 "The two young men obeyed.
033.431 "The bandit imitated the crow's cry three times.
033.432 "A croak answered this triple call.
033.433 "-That's good, said the bandit. Now you can go on your way."
033.434 "Luigi and Teresa set off again.
033.435 "But as they went on, Teresa, trembling, clung to her lover; indeed, through the trees, one could see weapons appearing and rifle barrels sparkling.
033.436 "The clearing of Rocca Bianca was at the top of a small mountain which formerly undoubtedly had been a volcano, volcano extinguished before Remus and Romulus had deserted Albe to come to build Rome.
033.437 "Teresa and Luigi reached the top and at the same time found themselves in front of about twenty bandits.
033.438 "--Here's a young man who's looking for you and wants to talk to you," said the sentry.
033.439 "--And what does he want to tell us?" asked the man who, in the absence of the chief, was acting as captain.
033.440 "--I want to say that I am bored with being a shepherd, said Vampa.
033.441 "--Ah! I understand, said the lieutenant, and you have come to ask to be admitted into our ranks?
033.442 "--Welcome!" shouted several bandits from Ferrusino, Pampinara and Anagni, who had recognized Luigi Vampa.
033.443 "--Yes, only I have come to ask you for something other than to be your companion.
033.444 "--And what have you come to ask of us?" said the bandits with astonishment.
033.445 "--I have come to ask to be your captain, said the young man.
033.446 "The bandits burst out laughing.
033.447 "--And what have you done to aspire to this honor?" asked the lieutenant.
033.448 "--I killed your chief Cucumetto, whose remains are here," said Luigi, "and I set fire to the villa of San-Felice to give a wedding dress to my fiancée.
033.449 "An hour later, Luigi Vampa was elected captain to replace Cucumetto.
033.450 -- Well, my dear Albert," said Franz, turning back to his friend, "what do you think now of the citizen Luigi Vampa?
033.451 -- I say that it is a myth, answered Albert, and that he never existed.
033.452 -- What is a myth?" asked Pastrini.
033.453 --That would take too long to explain to you, my dear host, replied Franz. And so you say that Master Vampa is currently practicing his profession in the vicinity of Rome?
033.454 -- And with a boldness that no bandit before him had ever shown.
033.455 -The police have tried in vain to seize him, then?
033.456 -- What do you want! He agrees with the shepherds of the plain, the fishermen of the Tiber and the smugglers of the coast. One seeks him in the mountains, he is on the river; one pursues him on the river, he reaches the open sea; then suddenly, when one believes him to have taken refuge in the island of Giglio, of Guanouti or of Monte Cristo, one sees him reappear at Albano, at Tivoli or at the Riccia.
033.457 -- And what is his way of dealing with travelers?
033.458 --Ah, my God! Depending on how far they are from the city, he gives them eight hours, twelve hours, or one day to pay their ransom; then, when this time has elapsed, he grants them an hour's grace. At the sixtieth minute of this hour, if he does not have the money, he blows the prisoner's brains out with a pistol, or stabs him in the heart, and all is said.
033.459 --Well, Albert," asked Franz of his companion, "are you still willing to go to the Colosseum by the outer boulevards?
033.460 --Perfectly, said Albert, if the road is more picturesque."
033.461 At this moment nine o'clock struck, the door opened and our coachman appeared.
033.462 "Excellencies," he said, "the carriage awaits you.
033.463 --Well," said Franz, "in that case, to the Colosseum!
033.464 --Through the Porta del Popolo, Excellencies, or through the streets?
033.465 --Through the streets, by the streets!
033.466 --Ah, my dear!" said Albert, rising in his turn and lighting his third cigar, "in truth, I thought you were braver than that.
033.467 With that, the two young men descended the stairs and got into the car.
034.000 Appearance.
034.001 Franz had found a way for Albert to arrive at the Colosseum without passing any ancient ruins, and therefore without the gradual preparations taking away a single cubit from the colossus' gigantic proportions. It was to follow via Sistinia, to cut at right angles in front of Santa Maria Maggiore, and to arrive by via Urbana and San Pietro in Vincoli until via del Colosseo.
034.002 This route had another advantage: it did not distract Franz from the impression made on him by the story told by Master Pastrini, in which his mysterious friend Monte Cristo was involved. So he sat down in his corner and fell back into the thousand endless interrogations he had made to himself, not one of which had given him a satisfactory answer.
034.003 One thing, moreover, had reminded him again of his friend Simbad the sailor: it was those mysterious relations between the brigands and the sailors. What Master Pastrini had said about the refuge that Vampa found on the boats of fishermen and smugglers reminded Franz of those two Corsican bandits he had found dining with the crew of the little yacht, which had turned aside and landed at Porto-Vecchio, with the sole purpose of putting them ashore. The name which his host at Monte Cristo called himself, pronounced by his host at the Hotel d'Espagne, proved to him that he played the same philanthropic part on the coasts of Piombino, Civita-Vecchia, Ostia, and Gaëte, as he did on those of Corsica, Tuscany, and Spain; and as he himself, as far as Franz could remember, had spoken of Tunis and Palermo, it was proof that he embraced a fairly wide circle of relations.
034.004 But however powerful all these reflections were on the young man's mind, they vanished the instant he saw the dark and gigantic spectre of the Colosseum rising before him, through whose openings the moon projected those long and pale rays which fall from the eyes of ghosts. The carriage stopped a few steps from the Mesa Sudans. The coachman came to open the door; the two young people jumped down from the car and found themselves in front of a cicerone which seemed to come out of the ground.
034.005 Since the one in the hotel had followed them, that made two of them.
034.006 It is impossible, moreover, to avoid in Rome this luxury of guides, besides the general cicerone who takes hold of you the moment you set foot on the threshold of the hotel door, and who does not leave you again until the day you set foot outside the city, there is still a special cicerone attached to each monument, and I will say almost to each fraction of the monument. Let us judge therefore if we must miss ciceroni to the Colosseo, that is to say to the monument par excellence, which made say to Martial:
034.007 "Let Memphis cease to boast to us the barbarous miracles of its pyramids, let the wonders of Babylon be sung no more; all must yield before the immense work of the amphitheatre of the Caesars, all the voices of fame must unite to praise this monument."
034.008 Franz and Albert did not try to escape from the Ciceronian tyranny. Besides, that would be all the more difficult as it is only the guides who have the right to traverse the monument with torches. They thus made no resistance, and gave themselves up bound hand and foot to their conductors.
034.009 Franz knew this walk for having made it ten times already. But as his companion, more novice, put for the first time the foot in the monument of Flavius Vespasian, I must confess it to his praise, in spite of the ignorant cackling of his guides, he was strongly impressed. It is that indeed one does not have any idea, when one did not see it, of the majesty of such a ruin, of which all the proportions are doubled still by the mysterious clearness of this southern moon whose rays seem a twilight of Occident.
034. 010 Also hardly Franz the thinker had made one hundred steps under the interior porticoes, that abandoning Albert to his guides, who did not want to give up the imprescriptible right to make him see in all their details the Pit of the Lions, the Lodge of Gladiators the Podium of the Caesars, he took a half-ruined staircase and, leaving them to continue their symmetrical road, he simply went to sit down in the shade of a column, in front of an indentation which allowed him to embrace the giant of granite in all its majestic extent.
034. 011 Franz had been there for about a quarter of an hour, lost, as I said, in the shade of a column, occupied to look at Albert, who, accompanied by his two torchbearers, had just come out of a vomitorium placed at the other end of the Colosseum, and which, like shadows following a will-o'-the-wisp, were descending from tier to tier towards the places reserved for the vestals, when it seemed to him to hear rolling in the depths of the monument a stone detached from the staircase situated opposite the one he had just taken to arrive at the place where he was sitting. It is not rare, no doubt, for a stone to break away under the foot of time and roll into the abyss; but this time it seemed to him that it was at the feet of a man that the stone had broken away and that the sound of footsteps was reaching him, although the one who caused it was doing everything he could to muffle it.
034.012 Indeed, after a moment, a man appeared, gradually emerging from the shadows as he climbed the staircase, whose opening, located in front of Franz, was lit by the moon, but whose steps, as one descended them, sank into darkness.
034.013 It could have been a traveler like himself, preferring solitary meditation to the meaningless chatter of his guides, and therefore his appearance had nothing to surprise him; but from the hesitation with which he climbed the last steps, from the way in which, when he reached the platform, he stopped and seemed to listen, it was evident that he had come there for a particular purpose and that he was waiting for someone.
034.014 With an instinctive movement, Franz stepped back as far as he could behind the column.
034.015 Ten feet above the ground where they both stood, the vault was sunken, and a round opening, similar to that of a well, gave a glimpse of the sky, all studded with stars.
034.016 Around this opening, which had perhaps already given passage to the rays of the moon for hundreds of years, grew bushes whose green and frail cuttings stood out vigorously against the dull azure of the firmament, while great lianas and powerful sprays of ivy hung down from this upper terrace and swayed under the vault, like floating ropes.
034.017 The personage whose mysterious arrival had attracted Franz's attention was placed in a half-shade which did not allow him to distinguish his features, but which however was not obscure enough to prevent him from detailing his costume: he was wrapped in a large brown cloak of which one of the pans, thrown back on his left shoulder, hid the lower part of his face, while his broad-brimmed hat covered the upper part. Only the extremity of his clothing was illuminated by the oblique light that passed through the opening, and which allowed one to distinguish a pair of black pants coquettishly framing a varnished boot.
034.018 This man obviously belonged, if not to the aristocracy, at least to high society.
034.019 He had been there for a few minutes and was beginning to show visible signs of impatience, when a slight noise was heard on the upper terrace.
034.020 At the same moment a shadow appeared to intercept the light, a man appeared at the opening, plunged his piercing gaze into the darkness, and saw the man with the cloak; at once he seized a handful of those hanging vines and floating ivy, let himself slide, and, arrived at three or four feet from the ground, jumped slightly to the ground. This one had the costume of a complete Transtever.
034.021 "Excuse me, Excellence, he says in Roman dialect, I made you wait. However, I am only a few minutes late. Ten o'clock has just sounded in Saint John Lateran.
034.022 -I was the one who was in advance and not you who was late, answered the foreigner in the purest Tuscan; thus no ceremony: moreover had you made me wait, that I would have suspected that it was by some reason independent of your will.
034.023 -- And you would have been right, Excellency, I come from the Castel Sant'Angelo, and I had all the trouble in the world to speak to Beppo.
034.024 --What is Beppo?
034.025 --Beppo is an employee of the prison, to whom I make a small income to know what happens in the interior of the castle of His Holiness.
034.026 --Ah! ah! I see that you are a man of precaution, my dear!
034.027 --What do you want, Excellency? One does not know what can happen; perhaps I too will one day be caught in the net like poor Peppino; and I will need a rat to gnaw through some of the meshes in my prison.
034.028 --Bref, what have you learned?
034.029 -- There will be two executions on Tuesday at two o'clock, as is the custom in Rome at the opening of the great festivals. One condemned man will be _mazzolato_; he is a wretch who has killed a priest who raised him, and who deserves no interest. The other will be _decapitato_, and that one is poor Peppino.
034.030 --What do you want, my dear, you inspire such great terror, not only in the pontifical government but also in the neighboring kingdoms, that they want to make an example of you.
034.031 --But Peppino is not even a member of my band; he is a poor shepherd who has committed no other crime than to provide us with food.
034.032 --This makes him your accomplice. Also, see that one has consideration for him: instead of knocking him out, as you will be, if ever one gets hold of him, one will be satisfied with guillotining him. Besides, this will vary the pleasures of the people, and there will be a spectacle for all tastes.
034.033 - Not counting the one I'm saving for him, which he doesn't expect," said the Transtever.
034.034 -My dear friend, allow me to say to you, resumed the man with the coat, that you seem to me all disposed to make some foolishness.
034.035 --I am willing to do anything to prevent the execution of the poor devil who is in trouble for having served me; by the Madonna! I would consider myself a coward if I did not do something for that good boy.
034.036 --And what will you do?
034.037 -- I will place a score of men around the scaffold, and when it is brought in, at the signal I will give, we will rush in with daggers in our fists to the escort and take it away.
034.038 --That seems to me to be very lucky, and I decidedly believe that my plan is better than yours.
034.039 -- And what is your plan, Excellency?
034.040 -- I will give ten thousand piastres to someone I know, who will get Peppino's execution postponed until next year; then, in the course of the year, I will give another thousand piastres to someone else I know, and get him out of prison.
034.041 -- Are you sure you will succeed?
034.042 --Goodbye! said the man with the coat in French.
034.043 --Does he need to? asked the Transtever.
034.044 -- I say, my dear, that I alone will do more with my gold than you and all your people with their daggers, their pistols, their carbines and their blunderbusses. So let me do it.
034.045 -- Wonderful; but if you fail, we will always be ready.
034.046 --Always be ready, if it is your pleasure, but be sure that I will have his grace.
034.047 --The day after tomorrow, Tuesday, pay attention. You have only tomorrow left.
034.048 -- Well, but the day consists of twenty-four hours, each hour consists of sixty minutes, each minute of sixty seconds; in eighty-six thousand four hundred seconds one can do many things.
034.049 - If you have succeeded, Excellency, how will we know?
034.050 -It is very simple. I have rented the last three windows of the Rospoli café; if I have obtained a reprieve, the two corner windows will be stretched in yellow damask, but the middle one will be stretched in white damask with a red cross.
034.051 -- Wonderful. And through whom will you pass the grace?
034.052 -- Send me one of your men disguised as a penitent and I will give it to him. Thanks to his costume, he will reach the foot of the scaffold and hand the bull to the head of the brotherhood, who will hand it to the executioner. In the meantime, let this news be known to Peppino; let him not die of fear or go mad, which would be the cause that we would have made for him a useless expense.
034.053 -- Listen, Excellency," said the peasant, "I am very devoted to you, and you are convinced of that, are you not?
034.054 -- I hope so, at least.
034.055 -- Well, if you save Peppino it will be more than devotion in the future, it will be obedience.
034.056 --Be careful what you say there, my dear! I will remind you perhaps one day, because perhaps one day I will also need you....
034.057 --Well, then, Excellency, you will find me at the hour of need as I will have found you at this same hour; then, even if you are at the other end of the world, you will only have to write to me: "Do this", and I will do it, faith of....
034.058 - Hush!" said the stranger, "I hear a noise.
034.059 --They are travelers who visit the Colosseum with torches.
034.060 -- It is useless that they find us together. These snitches of guides could recognize you; and, so honorable as your friendship is, my dear friend, if one knew us linked as we are, this connection, I am afraid, would make me lose a little of my credit.
034.061 -So, if you have the reprieve?
034.062 --The middle window stretched in damask with a red cross.
034.063 --If you don't have it?
034.064 --Three yellow hangings.
034.065 --And then?
034.066 --So, my dear friend, play the dagger at your ease, I allow you, and I will be there to see you do it.
034.067 --Farewell, Excellency, I count on you, count on me."
034.068 At these words the Transtevere disappeared up the stairs, while the stranger, covering his face more than ever with his cloak, passed within two steps of Franz and descended into the arena by the outer bleachers.
034.069 A second later, Franz heard his name resound under the vaults: it was Albert calling him.
034.070 He waited to answer until the two men had gone away, not caring to tell them that they had had a witness who, if he had not seen their faces, had not lost a word of their conversation.
034.071 Ten minutes later, Franz was driving towards the Spanish hotel, listening with a very impertinent distraction to the learned dissertation that Albert was making, according to Pliny and Calpurnius, on the nets furnished with iron spikes that prevented the ferocious animals from rushing at the spectators.
034.072 He let him go without contradicting him; he was anxious to be alone to think without distraction about what had just happened before him.
034.073 Of these two men, one was certainly a stranger to him, and it was the first time he had seen and heard him, but not so of the other; and, although Franz had not distinguished his face constantly buried in the shadows or hidden by his cloak, the accents of this voice had struck him too much the first time he had heard them for them ever to resound before him without his recognizing them.
034.074 There was especially in the mocking intonations something shrill and metallic that had made him flinch in the ruins of the Colosseum as in the cave of Monte Cristo.
034.075 He was convinced that this man was none other than Simbad the sailor.
034.076 Also, in any other circumstance, the curiosity that this man had inspired in him would have been so great that he would have made himself known to him, but on this occasion, the conversation that he had just heard was too intimate for him not to be held back by the very sensible fear that his appearance would not be pleasant to him. He had therefore let him go away, as we have seen, but promising himself, if he met him another time, not to let this second opportunity slip away as he had done with the first.
034.077 Franz was too preoccupied to sleep well. His night was employed in passing over and over in his mind all the circumstances which related to the man in the cave and the stranger in the Coliseum, and which tended to make of these two characters the same individual; and the more Franz thought of them, the more he became firm in this opinion.
034.078 He fell asleep at daylight, and this caused him to awaken only very late. Albert, like a true Parisian, had already taken precautions for the evening. He had sent for a box at the Argentina Theater.
034.079 Franz had several letters to write in France, so he left the car with Albert for the whole day.
034.080 At five o'clock Albert returned; he had carried his letters of recommendation, had invitations for all his parties, and had seen Rome.
034.081 One day had been enough for Albert to do all this.
034.082 And he had had time to find out about the play that was being performed and the actors who would perform it.
034.083 The title of the play was _Parisiana_: _Parisiana_; the actors were named: Coselli, Moriani and Spech.
034.084 Our two young people were not so unhappy, as we can see: they were going to attend the performance of one of the best operas by the author of _Lucia di Lammermoor_, played by three of the most renowned artists in Italy.
034.085 Albert had never been able to get used to ultramontane theaters, to whose orchestra one does not go, and which have neither balconies nor open boxes; it was hard for a man who had his stall at the Bouffes and his share of the infernal box at the Opera.
034.086 This did not prevent Albert from making flamboyant toilets every time he went to the Opera with Franz; lost toilets; for, it must be confessed to the shame of one of the most worthy representatives of our fashion, for four months that he had been crisscrossing Italy in all directions, Albert had not had a single adventure.
034.087 Albert sometimes tried to joke about it; but deep down he was singularly mortified, he, Albert de Morcerf, one of the most popular young men, to be still at his expense. The thing was all the more painful because, according to the modest habit of our dear compatriots, Albert had left Paris with the conviction that he was going to have the greatest success in Italy, and that he would come to make the delights of the boulevard of Ghent of the account of his good fortunes.
034.088 Alas! it had been nothing of the kind: the charming Genoese, Florentine and Neapolitan countesses had held fast, not to their husbands, but to their lovers, and Albert had acquired this cruel conviction, that the Italian women have at least on the French the advantage of being faithful to their infidelity.
034.089 I do not want to say that in Italy, as everywhere, there are not exceptions.
034.090 And yet Albert was not only a perfectly elegant horseman, but also a man of much spirit; moreover he was a viscount: of new nobility, it is true; but today that one does not make any more his proofs, what does it matter that one dates from 1399 or 1815! On top of all that he had fifty thousand pounds of income. It was more than enough, as one can see, to be fashionable in Paris. It was therefore somewhat humiliating to have not yet been seriously noticed by anyone in any of the cities where he had passed.
034.091 But he also intended to make up for it in Rome, Carnival being, in all the countries of the earth that celebrate this estimable institution, a time of freedom when the most severe let themselves be led into some act of madness. Now, as the carnival opened the next day, it was very important that Albert launch his prospectus before this opening.
034.092 Albert had thus, with this intention, rented one of the most apparent boxes of the theater, and made, to go there, an irreproachable toilet. It was in the first row, which replaces with us the gallery. Besides, the first three floors are as aristocratic as the others, and for this reason they are called the noble ranks.
034.093 Besides, this box, where twelve people could fit without being crowded, had cost the two friends a little less than a box for four people at the Ambigu.
034.094 Albert had yet another hope, that if he managed to take a place in the heart of a beautiful Roman woman, this would naturally lead him to conquer a _posto_ in the carriage, and consequently to see the carnival from the top of an aristocratic vehicle or from a princely balcony.
034.095 All these considerations made Albert more lively than he had ever been. He turned his back on the actors, leaning halfway out of the dressing room and leering at all the pretty women with a six-inch-long binocular.
034.096 Which did not lead a single pretty woman to reward with a single glance, even of curiosity, all the movement that Albert gave himself.
034.097 Indeed, each one spoke about his businesses, his loves, his pleasures, of the carnival which opened the day after the next holy week, without paying attention one moment neither to the actors, nor to the play, with the exception of the moments indicated, where each one then turned over, either to hear a portion of the recitative of Coselli, or to applaud some brilliant line of Moriani, or to shout bravo to the Spech; then the particular conversations took again their usual train.
034.098 Towards the end of the first act, the door of a dressing room which had remained empty until then opened, and Franz saw a person enter to whom he had had the honor of being introduced in Paris and whom he believed to be still in France. Albert saw the movement that his friend made at this appearance, and turning towards him:
034.099 "Do you know this woman?" he said.
034.100 --Yes; how do you like her?
034.101 --Charming, my dear, and blonde. Oh, the lovely hair! Is she French?
034.102 --She is a Venetian.
034.103 --And you call her?
034.104 --The Countess G...
034.105 --Oh! I know her by name," cried Albert; "they say she is as witty as she is pretty. I think I could have been introduced to her at Madame de Villefort's last ball, where she was, and that I neglected it: I am a great fool!
034.106 --Do you want me to right this wrong?" asked Franz.
034.107 --How can you know her well enough to take me to her dressing room?
034.108 --I have had the honor of talking to her three or four times in my life; but, you know, that is strictly enough not to commit an impropriety."
034.109 At this moment the countess caught sight of Franz and made a graceful sign with her hand, to which he replied with a respectful bow of the head.
034.110 "Oh, but it seems to me that you are at your best with her," said Albert.
034.111 --Well, that is what deceives you and what will make us Frenchmen do a thousand foolish things abroad: it is to submit everything to our Parisian points of view; in Spain, and especially in Italy, never judge the intimacy of people by the freedom of their relations. We found ourselves in sympathy with the Countess, that's all.
034.112 --In sympathy of heart?" asked Albert, laughing.
034.113 -- No, in spirit, that's all," answered Franz seriously.
034.114 -- And on what occasion?
034.115 -- On the occasion of a walk to the Coliseum like the one we took together.
034.116 -- In the moonlight?
034.117 -- Yes.
034.118 --Alone?
034.119 -- Just about!
034.120 --And you spoke...
034.121 --The dead.
034.122 --Ah!" exclaimed Albert, "it was really quite recreational. Well, I promise you that if I have the good fortune to be the beautiful Countess's escort on such a walk, I will speak to her only about the living.
034.123 -- And perhaps you will be wrong.
034.124 -- In the meantime, you will introduce me to her as you promised?
034.125 -- As soon as the canvas is down.
034.126 -- How long is this damn first act!
034.127 -- Listen to the finale, it is very beautiful, and Coselli sings it admirably.
034.128 -- Yes, but what a turn of events!
034.129 -- The Spech is very dramatic.
034.130 --You understand that when you have heard the Sontag and the Malibran....
034.131 --Don't you think Moriani's method is excellent?
034.132 --I don't like brown people who sing blond.
034.133 --Ah, my dear," said Franz, turning around, while Albert continued to stare, "in truth you are too difficult!
034.134 At last the cloth fell away to the great satisfaction of the Viscount de Morcerf, who took his hat, gave a quick hand to his hair, tie, and cuffs, and remarked to Franz that he was waiting for him.
034.135 As the countess, whom Franz was questioning with her eyes, made him understand by a sign that he would be welcome, Franz put no delay in satisfying Albert's eagerness, and following his companion, who was taking advantage of the trip to rectify the false folds that the movements had left in his shirt collar and the lapel of his suit, he came to knock at box number 4, which was the one occupied by the countess.
034.136 Immediately the young man who was sitting next to her in the front of the box rose, giving up his seat, according to Italian custom, to the newcomer, who must give it up in turn when another visitor arrives.
034.137 Franz introduced Albert to the Countess as one of our most distinguished young men in social standing and mind; which, moreover, was true; for in Paris, and in the milieu in which Albert lived, he was an irreproachable cavalier. He added that, despairing of not having been able to take advantage of the countess's stay in Paris to be introduced to her, he had charged him with repairing this fault, a mission which he discharged by begging the countess, near whom he himself would have needed an introducer, to excuse his indiscretion.
034.138 The countess responded by giving Albert a charming bow and extending her hand to Franz.
034.139 Albert, invited by her, took the empty seat at the front, and Franz sat in the second row behind the Countess.
034.140 Albert had found an excellent subject for conversation: it was Paris, and he spoke to the countess about their common acquaintances. Franz understood that he was on the spot. He let him go, and, asking him for his gigantic spyglass, he began in turn to explore the room.
034.141 Alone in the front of a box, placed in the third row in front of them, was a beautiful woman dressed in a Greek costume, which she wore with such ease that it was obvious that it was her natural costume.
034.142 Behind her, in the shadows, was the form of a man whose face was impossible to make out.
034.143 Franz interrupted the conversation of Albert and the Countess to ask the latter if she knew the beautiful Albanian woman who was so worthy of attracting not only the attention of men, but also of women.
034.144 "No," she said; "all I know is that she has been in Rome since the beginning of the season; for at the opening of the theater I saw her where she is, and for a month she has not missed a single performance, sometimes accompanied by the man who is with her at the moment, sometimes followed merely by a black servant.
034.145 --How do you find her, Countess?
034.146 --Extremely beautiful. Medora must have looked like this woman."
034.147 Franz and the Countess exchanged a smile. She went back to talking with Albert, and Franz to leering at his Albanian.
034.148 The curtain rose on the ballet. It was one of those good Italian ballets staged by the famous Henri, who had made for himself, as a choreographer, a colossal reputation in Italy, which the unfortunate man had come to lose at the nautical theater; one of those ballets in which everyone, from the first subject to the last companion, takes such an active part in the action that a hundred and fifty people make the same gesture at the same time and lift together either the same arm or the same leg.
034.149 This ballet was called _Poliska_.
034.150 Franz was too preoccupied with his beautiful Greek to care about the ballet, however interesting it was. As for her, she took a visible pleasure in the spectacle, a pleasure which made a supreme opposition to the profound insouciance of the one who accompanied her, and who, as long as the choreographic masterpiece lasted, did not make a movement, seeming, in spite of the infernal noise which the trumpets, the cymbals and the Chinese hats in the orchestra led, to enjoy the celestial sweetnesses of a peaceful and radiant sleep.
034.151 Finally the ballet ended, and the canvas fell amidst the frenzied applause of an intoxicated audience.
034.152 Thanks to this habit of cutting the opera with a ballet, the intermissions are very short in Italy, the singers having time to rest and change costumes while the dancers perform their pirouettes and make their entrechats.
034.153 The overture to the second act began; at the first strokes of the bow, Franz saw the sleeper slowly rise and approach the Greek, who turned to address him a few words, and leaned back on the front of the box.
034.154 The figure of his interlocutor was still in shadow, and Franz could not distinguish any of his features.
034.155 As the curtain rose, Franz's attention was necessarily drawn to the actors, and his eyes left the dressing room of the beautiful Greek woman for a moment to focus on the stage.
034.156 The act opens, as is well known, with the duet of the dream: Parisina, lying down, lets slip in front of Azzo the secret of her love for Ugo; the betrayed husband passes by all the fury of jealousy, until, convinced that his wife is unfaithful to him, he wakes her up to announce his next revenge.
034.157 This duet is one of the most beautiful, most expressive and most terrible that came out of Donizetti's fertile pen. Franz was hearing it for the third time, and although he did not pass for a rabid music lover, it produced a profound effect on him. He was about to join in the applause of the audience when his hands, ready to join together, remained apart and the bravo that escaped from his mouth died on his lips.
034.158 The man in the box had risen to his feet, and, with his head in the light, Franz had just found the mysterious inhabitant of Monte Cristo, the one whose height and voice he had seemed to recognize so well the day before in the ruins of the Colosseum.
034.159 There was no longer any doubt that the strange traveler lived in Rome.
034.160 No doubt the expression on Franz's face was in harmony with the trouble this appearance threw into his mind, for the countess looked at him, burst out laughing, and asked him what was wrong.
034.161 "Madam Countess," replied Franz, "I asked you just now if you knew this Albanian woman: now I will ask you if you know her husband.
034.162 --No more than she does," replied the Countess.
034.163 --Have you never noticed him?
034.164 --That's a French question! You know very well that, for us Italian women, there is no other man in the world than the one we love!
034.165 --That's right," replied Franz.
034.166 -- In any case, she said, putting Albert's binoculars to her eyes and pointing them toward the lodge, it must be some newly unearthed person, some deceased person who has come out of the grave with the gravedigger's permission, for he looks awfully pale to me.
034.167 -- He is always like that," Franz answered.
034.168 --Do you know him then?" asked the Countess; "Then I'll ask you who he is.
034.169 -- I think I have seen him before, and I think I recognize him.
034.170 -- Indeed," she said, making a movement of her beautiful shoulders as if a thrill were running through her veins, "I understand that when one has once seen such a man one never forgets him."
034.171 The effect Franz had experienced was therefore not a particular impression, since another person felt it as he did.
034.172 "Well," Franz asked the Countess after she had taken it upon herself to leer at him a second time, "what do you think of this man?
034.173 --That it looks to me like Lord Ruthwen in the flesh."
034.174 Indeed, this new memory of Byron struck Franz: if any man could make him believe in the existence of vampires, it was this man.
034.175 "I must know who he is," said Franz, rising to his feet.
034.176 --Oh, no," cried the Countess; "no, don't leave me, I count on you to drive me back, and I'll keep you.
034.177 -- What! really," said Franz, leaning close to her ear, "are you afraid?
034.178 -- Listen, she said, Byron swore to me that he believed in vampires, he told me that he had seen them, he depicted their face to me, well, that's absolutely it: that black hair, those large eyes shining with a strange flame, that mortal pallor; then, notice that he is not with a woman like all women, he is with a foreigner... a Greek, a schismatic... no doubt some magician like himself. I beg you, don't go there. Tomorrow you can go after him if you like, but today I declare that I am keeping you."
034.179 Franz insisted.
034.180 "Listen," she said, getting up, "I'm leaving, I can't stay until the end of the show, I have people at home: will you be ungallant enough to refuse me your company?"
034.181 There was no other answer to make than to take his hat, open the door, and present his arm to the countess.
034.182 This he did.
034.183 The Countess was truly deeply moved; and Franz himself could not escape a certain superstitious terror, all the more natural because what was in the Countess the product of an instinctive sensation was in him the result of a memory.
034.184 He felt that she was trembling as she got into the car.
034.185 He drove her home: no one was there, and she was not expected; he reproached her for it.
034.186 "Really," she said, "I don't feel well, and I need to be alone; the sight of this man has upset me.
034.187 Franz tried to laugh.
034.188 "Don't laugh," she told him; besides, you don't feel like it. Then promise me one thing.
034.189 -What?
034.190 --Promise me.
034.191 --Anything you want, except to give up finding out who this man is. I have reasons that I cannot tell you for wanting to know who he is, where he comes from and where he is going.
034.192 - I don't know where he comes from, but I can tell you where he is going: he is going to hell for sure.
034.193 -Let's go back to the promise you wanted to demand of me, Countess, said Franz.
034.194 --Ah, it is to go straight back to the hotel and not to try to see this man tonight. There are certain affinities between the people one leaves and the people one joins. Don't be a driver between this man and me. Tomorrow run after him if you like, but never introduce him to me, if you don't want to scare me to death. On that note, good night, try to sleep, I know well who will not sleep."
034.195 And at these words the Countess left Franz, leaving him undecided whether she had been amused at his expense or whether she had really felt the fear she had expressed.
034.196 Returning to the hotel, Franz found Albert in his robe, in his footed pants, voluptuously stretched out on an armchair and smoking his cigar.
034.197 "Ah, it's you!" he said to him; "my goodness, I wasn't expecting you until tomorrow.
034.198 -My dear Albert, replied Franz, I am happy to find the occasion to tell you once and for all that you have the most false idea of Italian women; it seems to me, however, that your misfortunes in love should have made you lose it.
034.199 --What do you want! These devilish women, it is to understand nothing! They give you their hand, they shake it; they speak to you softly, they make you drive them home: with a quarter of these ways, a Parisian woman would lose her reputation.
034.200 -- It is precisely because they have nothing to hide, it is because they live in the great sunshine, that women put on so few manners in the beautiful country where the "si" resounds, as Dante says. Besides, you saw well that the countess was really afraid.
034.201 --Fear of what? Of this honest gentleman who was in front of us with this pretty Greek woman? But I wanted to know for sure when they came out, and I passed them in the corridor. I don't know where the hell you got all your otherworldly ideas! He is a very handsome boy who is very well dressed, and who looks as if he had been dressed in France at Blin's or Humann's; a little pale, it is true, but you know that pallor is a mark of distinction."
034.202 Franz smiled, Albert had great pretensions to being pale.
034.203 "Also," Franz told him, "I am convinced that the Countess's ideas about this man are not common sense. Has he spoken near you, and have you heard any of his words?
034.204 --He spoke, but in Roman. I recognized the idiom by some disfigured Greek words. I must tell you, my dear, that in college I was very good at Greek.
034.205 - So he spoke Roman?
034.206 --Probably.
034.207 --No more doubts, Franz murmured, it's him.
034.208 --You say?
034.209 --Nothing. What were you doing there?
034.210 -- I was saving you a surprise.
034.211 --What?
034.212 -- You know that it is impossible to get a carriage?
034.213 --Pardon! since we have done everything humanly possible in vain for it.
034.214 --Well, I have had a wonderful idea."
034.215 Franz looked at Albert as a man who had little confidence in his imagination.
034.216 "My dear," said Albert, "you honor me there with a look that would well deserve that I ask you for reparation.
034.217 --I am ready to make it to you, dear friend, if the idea is as ingenious as you say.
034.218 -- Listen.
034.219 -- I am listening.
034.220 -- There is no way to get a car, is there?
034.221 --No.
034.222 -- No horses?
034.223 --No more.
034.224 --But you can get a cart?
034.225 --Maybe.
034.226 --A pair of oxen?
034.227 --Probably.
034.228 -- Well, my dear, that's our business. I will have the cart decorated, we will dress as Neapolitan harvesters, and we will represent the magnificent painting of Leopold Robert. If for greater resemblance, the countess wants to take the costume of a woman of Pozzuoli or Sorrento, that will complete the masquerade, and she is beautiful enough to be taken for the original of the Woman with Child.
034.229 --Goddamn it!" exclaimed Franz, "for this time you are right, Mr. Albert, and this is a truly happy idea.
034.230 --And all national, renewed from the lazy kings, my dear, only that! Ah, gentlemen of the Romans, you think that we will run on foot through your streets like lazzaroni, and that because you lack carriages and horses; well, we will invent them.
034.231 --And have you ever told anyone about this triumphant imagination?
034.232 -- To our host. When I got home, I asked him to come up and tell him what I wanted. He assured me that nothing was easier; I wanted to gild the horns of the oxen, but he told me that it required three days: we will have to do without this superfluity.
034.233 --And where is he?
034.234 --Who?
034.235 -- Our host?
034.236 -- In search of the thing. Tomorrow it might be a little late.
034.237 -- So he's going to give us an answer this very evening?
034.238 -- I'm waiting for him."
034.239 At this moment the door opened, and Master Pastrini passed his head.
034.240 "_Permesso_?" he said.
034.241 --Certainly it is permitted!" cried Franz.
034.242 --Well, said Albert, did you find us the cart and the oxen we asked for?
034.243 --I found better than that, he answered with an air of perfect self-satisfaction.
034.244 --Ah, my dear host, beware, said Albert, the best is the enemy of the good.
034.245 --Let Your Excellencies rely on me, said Master Pastrini in a capable tone.
034.246 --But what is it? asked Franz in his turn.
034.247 -- You know, said the innkeeper, that the Count of Monte Cristo lives on the same square as you?
034.248 -- I believe so, said Albert, since it is thanks to him that we are housed like two students in the Rue Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet.
034.249 --Well, he knows the embarrassment in which you find yourself, and has made you an offer of two places in his carriage and two places at his windows in the Rospoli Palace."
034.250 Albert and Franz looked at each other.
034.251 "But," asked Albert, "must we accept the offer of this stranger, of a man we do not know?
034.252 --What man is this Count of Monte Cristo?" asked Franz of his host.
034.253 -- A very great Sicilian or Maltese lord, I don't know exactly, but noble as a Borghese and rich as a gold mine.
034.254 --It seems to me," said Franz to Albert, "that if this man were as well-mannered as our host says, he should have sent us his invitation in some other way, either by writing to us, or....
034.255 At that moment there was a knock at the door.
034.256 "Come in," said Franz.
034.257 A servant, dressed in a perfectly elegant livery, appeared on the threshold of the room.
034.258 "On behalf of the Count of Monte Cristo, for Mr. Franz d'Épinay and for Mr. Viscount Albert de Morcerf," he said.
034.259 And he presented the host with two cards, which the latter handed to the young men.
034.260 "Mr. Count de Monte Cristo," continued the servant, "has asked these gentlemen for permission to appear as a neighbor tomorrow morning at their house; he will have the honor of inquiring of these gentlemen at what hour they will be visible.
034.261 --My goodness, said Albert to Franz, there is nothing to take back, everything is there.
034.262 --Tell the Count," Franz replied, "that we will have the honor of paying him a visit.
034.263 The servant withdrew.
034.264 "This is what is called an assault of elegance," said Albert; "come on, you were definitely right, Master Pastrini, and your Count of Monte Cristo is a very proper man.
034.265 -So you accept his offer? said the host.
034.266 --My goodness, yes," replied Albert. However, I confess to you that I miss our cart and the reapers; and, if it were not for the window of the Rospoli palace to compensate for what we are losing, I think I would go back to my first idea: what do you say, Franz?
034.267 -- I say that it is also the windows of the Rospoli Palace that decide me," Franz answered Albert.
034.268 Indeed, this offer of two seats at a window of the Rospoli palace had reminded Franz of the conversation he had overheard in the ruins of the Colosseum between his stranger and his Transtevere, a conversation in which the man with the cloak had pledged to obtain the pardon of the condemned. Now, if the man with the cloak was, as everything led Franz to believe, the same man whose appearance in the Argentina room had so preoccupied him, he would undoubtedly recognize him, and then nothing would prevent him from satisfying his curiosity about him.
034.269 Franz spent part of the night dreaming about his two appearances and longing for the next day. Indeed, the next day everything would become clear; and this time, unless his host at Monte Cristo possessed the ring of Gyges and, thanks to this ring, the faculty of making himself invisible, it was obvious that he would not escape. So he was awake before eight o'clock.
034.270 As for Albert, since he did not have the same motives as Franz for being up early, he still slept as best he could.
034.271 Franz sent for his host, who introduced himself with his usual obsequiousness.
034.272 "Master Pastrini," he said, "isn't there to be an execution today?
034.273 --Yes, Excellency; but if you are asking me to have a window, you are going about it very late.
034.274 -- No," continued Franz; "besides, if I wanted to see this spectacle absolutely, I would find a place, I think, on Mount Pincio.
034.275 --Oh, I presumed that Your Excellency would not want to compromise himself with all the scoundrels, whose natural amphitheater it is, so to speak.
034.276 --I probably won't go, said Franz; but I would like to have some details.
034.277 --What are they?
034.278 -- I would like to know the number of the condemned, their names, and the kind of torture they suffered.
034.279 --This is very timely, Your Excellency; the "tablets" have just been brought to me.
034.280 --What are the _tavolettes_?
034.281 --The _tavolettes_ are wooden tablets which are hung up on every street corner on the eve of executions, and on which are pasted the names of the condemned, the cause of their condemnation, and the method of their torture. The purpose of this notice is to invite the faithful to pray to God to give the guilty a sincere repentance.
034.282 --And these _tavolettes_ are brought to you so that you may join your prayers to those of the faithful?
034.283 -- No, Excellency; I have made an agreement with the glue-maker, and he brings me these as he brings me the posters for the shows, so that if any of my travelers wish to attend the execution, they may be warned.
034.284 --Ah, but this is a very delicate matter!
034.285 --Oh!" said Master Pastrini, smiling, "I can boast of doing everything in my power to satisfy the noble foreigners who honor me with their trust.
034.286 -That is what I see, my host! and that is what I will repeat to whoever will listen, be sure of it. In the meantime, I would like to read one of these _tavolette_.
034.287 - "That's easy," said the host, opening the door; "I've had one put on the square.
034.288 He went out, untied the _tavoletta_, and presented it to Franz.
034.289 Here is the literal translation of the patibular poster:
034.290 "It is made known to all that on Tuesday, February 22, the first day of Carnival, there will be, by order of the tribunal of the Rota, executed, in the Piazza del Popolo the named Andrea Rondolo, guilty of murdering the most respectable and revered person of Don Caesar Terlini, canon of the church of St. John Lateran, and the named Peppino, known as _Rocca Priori_, convicted of complicity with the detestable bandit Luigi Vampa and the men of his troop.
034.291 "The first will be _mazzolato_.
034.292 "And the second _decapitato_.
034.293 "Charitable souls are requested to ask God for sincere repentance for these two unfortunate convicts."
034.294 This was indeed what Franz had heard on the watch, in the ruins of the Colosseum, and nothing was changed in the program: the names of the condemned, the cause of their torment, and the kind of execution were exactly the same.
034.295 Thus, in all probability, the Transtevere was none other than the bandit Luigi Vampa, and the man with the cloak Simbad the sailor, who, in Rome as in Porto-Vecchio, and in Tunis, continued the course of his philanthropic expeditions.
034.296 However, time was running out, it was nine o'clock, and Franz was about to wake Albert, when to his great astonishment he saw him come out of his room fully dressed. The carnival had gone through his mind, and had awakened him earlier than his friend had expected.
034.297 "Well," said Franz to his host, "now that we are both ready, do you think, my dear Mr. Pastrini, that we can present ourselves at the Count of Monte Cristo's?
034.298 --Oh, certainly!" he replied; "the Count of Monte Cristo is in the habit of being very early, and I am sure that he has been up for more than two hours already.
034.299 --And you think there is no indiscretion in going to his house now?
034.300 -- None.
034.301 --In that case, Albert, if you are ready....
034.302 --All ready, says Albert.
034.303 --Let's go and thank our neighbor for his courtesy.
034.304 --Let's go!
034.305 Franz and Albert had only the square to cross, the innkeeper preceded them and rang the bell for them; a servant came to open.
034.306 "_I Signori Francesi_," said the host.
034.307 The servant bowed and beckoned them in.
034.308 They passed through two rooms furnished with a luxury they did not expect to find in Master Pastrini's hotel, and finally arrived in a salon of perfect elegance. A Turkish carpet was stretched over the floor, and the most comfortable furniture offered its bouncing cushions and upturned files. Magnificent pictures by masters, interspersed with splendid trophies of arms, hung on the walls, and large tapestry doors floated before the doors.
034.309 "If Their Excellencies will sit down," said the servant, "I will tell Mr. Count."
034.310 And he disappeared through one of the doors.
034.311 As this door opened, the sound of a _guzla_ reached the two friends, but died away at once: the door, closed again almost at the same time as it had been opened, had allowed only a whiff of harmony to enter the salon.
034.312 Franz and Albert exchanged a glance and looked at the furniture, the pictures and the weapons. All this, at the second sight, seemed to them even more magnificent than at the first.
034.313 "Well," Franz asked his friend, "what do you think of this?
034.314 -My dear, I say that our neighbor must be some stockbroker who has gambled on the Spanish funds, or some prince who travels incognito.
034.315 --Hush!" said Franz; "that's what we're going to find out, because here he is.
034.316 Indeed, the sound of a door turning on its hinges had just reached the visitors; and almost at once the tapestry, lifting itself, gave passage to the owner of all these riches.
034.317 Albert went forward to meet him, but Franz remained in his place.
034.318 The one who had just entered was none other than the man with the Colosseum coat, the stranger in the lodge, the mysterious guest of Monte Cristo.
035.000 The mazzolata.
035.001 "Sirs, says while entering the count of Monte-Cristo, receive all my excuses of what I let myself warn, but by presenting me of better hour at your place, I would have feared to be indiscreet. Besides, you made me say that you would come, and I was at your disposal.
035.002 --Franz and I have a thousand thanks to present to you, Count, said Albert; you have really saved us from a great embarrassment, and we were inventing the most fantastic vehicles when your gracious invitation reached us.
035.003 -- "Oh, my God!" said the Count, motioning to the two young men to sit down on a couch, "it is the fault of that fool Pastrini, if I have left you in distress so long! He had not told me a word about your embarrassment, to me who, alone and isolated as I am here, was only looking for an opportunity to get to know my neighbors. From the moment I learned that I could be good for you, you saw how eagerly I seized this opportunity to present my compliments."
035.004 The two young men bowed. Franz had not yet found a single word to say; he had not yet made any resolution, and, as there was nothing in the Count to indicate his willingness to recognize him or the desire to be recognized by him, he did not know whether he should, by any word, allude to the past, or leave time for the future to bring him new proofs. Besides, sure that it was he who was the day before in the lodge, he could not answer as positively as he who was watching her, was in the Coliseum, he therefore resolved to let things go without making any direct overture to the count. Moreover he had a superiority on him, he was master of his secrecy, whereas on the contrary he could not have any action on Franz, who had nothing to hide.
035.005 However he resolved to make the conversation fall on a point which could, while waiting, always bring the clarification of certain doubts.
035.006 "Mr. Count," he said to him, "you have offered us places in your carriage and places at your windows in the Palazzo Rospoli; now, could you tell us how we can get some sort of position, as they say in Italy, in the Piazza del Popolo?
035.007 --Ah, yes, that's right, said the Count with a distracted air and looking at Morcerf with sustained attention; isn't there, in Piazza del Popolo, something like an execution?
035.008 --Yes, answered Franz, seeing that he was coming of his own accord to where he wanted to take him.
035.009 --Wait, wait, I think I told my steward yesterday to take care of that; perhaps I can do you that little service again."
035.010 He extended his hand toward a bell cord, which he pulled three times.
035.011 "Did you ever worry," he said to Franz, "about the use of time and how to simplify the comings and goings of servants? I have made a study of it: when I ring once, it is for my valet; twice, it is for my butler; three times, it is for my steward. In this way, I do not lose a minute or a word. Here is our man."
035.012 Then an individual of forty-five to fifty years of age was seen to enter, who seemed to Franz to resemble as closely as possible the smuggler who had brought him into the cave, but who did not seem to recognize him in the least. He saw that the word was given.
035.013 "Mr. Bertuccio," said the Count, "have you taken care, as I ordered you yesterday, to get me a window in the Piazza del Popolo?
035.014 --Yes, Excellency," replied the intendant, "but it was very late.
035.015 --How!" said the Count, frowning, "did I not tell you that I wanted one?
035.016 --And Your Excellency has one too, the one that was rented to Prince Lobanieff; but I was obliged to pay one hundred....
035.017 --That's good, that's good, Mr. Bertuccio, spare these gentlemen all these household details; you have the window, that's all it takes. Give the address of the house to the coachman, and stand on the stairs to drive us: that's enough; go.
035.018 The steward saluted and took a step back.
035.019 "Ah!" said the Count, "do me the pleasure of asking Pastrini if he has received the _tavoletta_, and if he wants to send me the program of the performance.
035.020 - "It is useless," said Franz, drawing his notebook from his pocket; "I have had these tablets before my eyes, I have copied them and here they are.
035.021 -That's good; then Mr. Bertuccio, you can withdraw, I don't need you anymore. Let us be informed only when lunch is served. These gentlemen," he continued, turning back to the two friends, "will they do me the honor of having lunch with me?
035.022 --But, in truth, sir count, said Albert, it would be an abuse.
035.023 --No, on the contrary, you give me great pleasure, you will return all this to me one day in Paris, one or the other and perhaps both of you. Mr. Bertuccio, you will set three place settings."
035.024 He took the notebook from Franz's hands.
035. 025 "We say, then," he continued in the tone in which he would have read the _Petites Affiches_, "that today, February 22, the named Andrea Rondolo, guilty of murdering the highly respected and revered person of Don Caesar Torlini, canon of the church of St. John Lateran, and the named Peppino, known as _Rocca Priori_, convicted of complicity with the detestable bandit Luigi Vampa and the men of his band, are to be executed..."
035.026 --Hum! "The first will be _mazzolato_, the second _decapitato_." Yes, indeed," said the Count, "that was the way it was supposed to be at first; but I think that since yesterday there has been some change in the order and progress of the ceremony.
035.027 --Bah! said Franz.
035.028 --Yes, yesterday at Cardinal Rospigliosi's, where I spent the evening, there was talk of something like a reprieve granted to one of the two condemned.
035.029 --To Andrea Rondolo? asked Franz.
035.030 --No..." said the Count carelessly; "to the other (he glanced at the notebook as if to remember the name), to Peppino," said _Rocca Priori_. This deprives you of a guillotine, but you still have the _mazzolata_, which is a very curious torture when you see it for the first time, and even for the second; while the other, which you must know, is too simple, too plain: there is nothing unexpected. The _mandaïa_ is not mistaken, she does not tremble, does not strike wrongly, does not repeat herself thirty times like the soldier who cut off the head of the Count of Chalais, and to whom, moreover, Richelieu had perhaps recommended the patient. Ah, here," added the Count in a contemptuous tone, "don't talk to me about Europeans for tortures, they don't understand anything about them and are really in the infancy or rather the old age of cruelty.
035.031 -- In truth, Count," replied Franz, "one would think that you had made a comparative study of the tortures of the different peoples of the world.
035.032 --There are few, at least, that I have not seen," the Count said coldly.
035.033 --And did you find pleasure in witnessing these horrible spectacles?
035.034 -My first feeling was repulsion, the second indifference, the third curiosity.
035.035 --Curiosity! The word is terrible, you know?
035.036 -Why? There is hardly in life but one serious preoccupation; it is death, well! is it not curious to study in what different ways the soul can leave the body, and how, according to the characters, the temperaments and even the mores of the country, the individuals support this supreme passage from being to nothingness? As for me, I answer you of one thing: it is that the more one has seen death, the easier it becomes to die: thus, in my opinion, death is perhaps a torment, but is not an expiation.
035.037 -- I don't understand you very well, said Franz; explain yourself, for I cannot tell you how much what you are telling me piques my curiosity.
035.038 --Listen, said the Count; and his face turned as sour as another's face turns to blood. If a man had made perish, by unheard-of tortures, in the midst of endless torments, your father, your mother, your mistress, one of those beings at last who, when uprooted from your heart, leave there an eternal void and an ever-bloody wound, Would you believe the reparation that society grants you sufficient, because the iron of the guillotine passed between the base of the occipital and the trapezius muscles of the murderer, and because the one who made you feel years of moral sufferings, felt a few seconds of physical pain?
035.039 -- Yes, I know," Franz continued, "human justice is insufficient as a consoler: it can shed blood in exchange for blood, that's all; you have to ask it what it can do and nothing else.
035.040 --And again I put to you a material case," resumed the Count, "the one in which society, attacked by the death of an individual in the base on which it rests, avenges death with death; but are there not millions of pains whose entrails of man can be torn apart without society taking the least care of them without offering it the insufficient means of vengeance of which we spoke just now? Are there not crimes for which the palms of the Turks, the troughs of the Persians, the rolled nerves of the Iroquois would be too gentle torments, and which, however, indifferent society leaves without punishment? Answer, are there no such crimes?
035.041 -- Yes, Franz continued, and it is to punish them that the duel is tolerated.
035.042 --Ah! the duel, exclaimed the count, a pleasant way, on my soul, of arriving at its goal, when the goal is vengeance! A man has taken away your mistress, a man has seduced your wife, a man has dishonored your daughter; Of a whole life, which had the right to expect from God the share of happiness that he promised to every human being in creating him, he has made an existence of pain, misery or infamy, and you believe yourself avenged because to this man, who has put delirium in your mind and despair in your heart, you have given a sword blow in the chest or put a bullet in the head? Come on! Not to mention that it is he who often emerges triumphant from the struggle, washed clean in the eyes of the world and in some way absolved by God. No, no," continued the Count, "if I ever had to take revenge, this is not how I would take it.
035.043 -So you disapprove of dueling? so you would not fight a duel? asked Albert in his turn, astonished to hear such a strange theory.
035.044 --Oh, yes, I would! said the Count. I would fight a duel for a misery, for an insult, for a denial, for a blow, and all the more carelessly because, thanks to the skill I have acquired in all the exercises of the body and to the slow habit I have acquired of danger, I would be almost certain to kill my man. Oh! if made! I would fight a duel for all that; but for a slow, deep, infinite, eternal pain, I would return, if it were possible, a pain similar to the one that would have been made to me: eye for eye, tooth for tooth, as say the Orientals, our masters in all things, these chosen ones of the creation who knew how to make themselves a life of dreams and a paradise of realities.
035.045 --But, said Franz to the Count, with this theory which constitutes you judge and executioner in your own cause, it is difficult for you to stand in a measure where you eternally escape yourself from the power of the law. Hatred is blind, anger is dizzy, and he who pours out vengeance on himself risks drinking a bitter drink.
035.046 --Yes, if he is poor and clumsy, no, if he is a millionaire and clever. Besides, the last resort for him is that last torture of which we spoke just now, that which the philanthropic French revolution has substituted for quartering and the wheel. Well, what is the torture, if he has avenged himself? In truth, I am almost sorry that, in all probability, this wretched Peppino is not _decapitato_, as they say, you would see how long it lasts, and if it is really worth talking about it. But, honourable gentlemen, we have here a singular conversation for a carnival day. How did it come about? Ah, I remember! you asked me for a seat at my window; well, so be it, you shall have it; but let us sit down to table first, for here comes the announcement that we are served."
035.047 Indeed, a servant opened one of the four doors of the salon and called out the sacramental words:
035.048 "_Al suo commodo_!"
035.049 The two young men rose and passed into the dining room.
035. 050 During lunch, which was excellent and served with infinite care, Franz sought Albert's gaze with his eyes, in order to read in it the impression which he did not doubt that the words of their host had produced in him; But either in his usual carelessness he had not paid much attention to them, or the concession which the Count of Monte Cristo had made to him in regard to the duel had reconciled him with him, or finally that the antecedents which we have recounted, known only to Franz, had doubled for him the effect of the Count's theories, he did not notice that his companion was in the least concerned; On the contrary, he honored the meal as a man condemned for four or five months to Italian cooking, that is, one of the worst cuisines in the world. As for the Count, he hardly touched each dish; one would have thought that by sitting down at table with his guests he was fulfilling a simple duty of politeness, and that he was waiting for them to leave so that he could be served some strange or particular dish.
035.051 This reminded Franz in spite of himself of the fear that the Count had inspired in the Countess G..., and the conviction in which he had left her that the Count, the man he had shown her in the box opposite her, was a vampire.
035.052 At the end of lunch, Franz pulled out his watch.
035.053 "Well," said the Count, "what are you doing?
035.054 --You'll excuse us, Count," Franz replied, "but we still have a thousand things to do.
035.055 --What are they?
035.056 --We have no disguises, and today disguises are de rigueur.
035.057 -- So don't worry about that. We have, I believe, in Piazza del Popolo, a particular room; I will have the costumes that you will want to indicate to me brought there, and we will mask ourselves immediately.
035.058 --After the execution? exclaimed Franz.
035.059 -- No doubt, after, during, or before, as you wish.
035.060 --In front of the scaffold?
035.061 --The scaffold is part of the party.
035.062 --Here, Count, I have thought about it, said Franz; I am definitely grateful for your kindness, but I will be content to accept a place in your carriage, a place at the window of the Palazzo Rospoli, and I will leave you free to dispose of my place at the window of the Piazza del Popolo.
035.063 --But you lose, I warn you, a very curious thing, answered the count.
035.064 --You will tell me about it, Franz continued, and I am convinced that in your mouth the story will impress me almost as much as the sight could do. Besides, more than once I have wanted to take it upon myself to attend an execution, and I have never been able to decide to do so; and you, Albert?
035.065 -Me, replied the viscount, I saw Castaing executed; but I think I was a little gray that day. It was the day of my graduation from the college, and we had spent the night at some cabaret.
035.066 - Besides, it is not a reason, because you did not do a thing in Paris, for you not to do it abroad: when one travels, it is to learn; when one changes place, it is to see. Think of the face you will make when someone asks you: "How do you perform in Rome? I don't know. And then, they say that the condemned man is an infamous rascal, a rascal who killed with a cane a good canon who had raised him as his son. What the hell! when one kills a man of the church, one takes a more suitable weapon than a cane, especially when this man of the church is perhaps our father. If you were traveling in Spain, you'd go see the bullfights, wouldn't you? Well, suppose it's a fight we're going to see; remember the ancient Romans of the Circus, the hunts where they killed three hundred lions and a hundred men. Remember, then, those eighty thousand spectators who clapped their hands, those wise matrons who led their daughters there to be married, and those charming vestals with white hands who made a charming little sign with their thumbs which meant: Come on, don't be lazy! finish off that man who is three-quarters dead.
035.067 -- Are you going, Albert? said Franz.
035.068 --My faith, yes, my dear! I was like you, but the Count's eloquence decided me.
035.069 --Let us go, then, since you want to, said Franz; but on my way to Piazza del Popolo, I want to pass by the Via del Corso; is that possible, sir count?
035.070 -- On foot, yes; in a car, no.
035.071 -- Well, I'll go on foot.
035.072 --It is necessary that you pass by the Rue du Cours?
035.073 --Yes, I have something to see there.
035.074 -- Well, let's go through Via del Corso, and we'll send the car to wait for us in the Piazza del Popolo, by the Strada del Babuino; besides, I'm not afraid to go through Via del Corso to see if the orders I gave have been carried out.
035.075 --Excellence, said the servant, opening the door, a man dressed as a penitent asks to speak to you.
035.076 --Ah yes, said the Count, I know what it is. Gentlemen, would you like to go back to the salon, you will find on the middle table some excellent Havana cigars, I will meet you there in a moment."
035.077 The two young men rose and went out by one door, while the Count, after renewing his apologies, went out by the other. Albert, who was a great lover, and who, since he had been in Italy, counted it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the café de Paris, approached the table and uttered a cry of joy on seeing true puros.
035.078 "Well," asked Franz, "what do you think of the Count of Monte Cristo?
035.079 -What I think of him!" said Albert, visibly astonished that his companion should ask him such a question; "I think he is a charming man, who does the honors of his home wonderfully, who has seen much, studied much, thought much, who is, like Brutus, of the stoic school, and," he added, lovingly blowing a puff of smoke that spiraled upward toward the ceiling, "and who, above all, possesses excellent cigars.
035.080 This was Albert's opinion of the Count; now, as Franz knew that Albert had the pretense of forming an opinion of men and things only after mature reflection, he made no attempt to change his own.
035.081 "But," he said, "have you noticed anything peculiar?
035.082 -What is it?
035.083 -The attention with which he looked at you.
035.084 -Me?
035.085 --Yes, you."
035.086 Albert reflected.
035.087 "Ah!" he said with a sigh, "there's nothing surprising about that. I have been absent from Paris for nearly a year; I must have clothes from the other world. The count will have taken me for a provincial; deceive him, dear friend, and tell him, I pray you, at the first opportunity, that it is nothing of the kind."
035.088 Franz smiled; a moment later the count returned.
035.089 "Here I am, gentlemen," he said, "and all yours, the orders are given; the carriage goes its way to Piazza del Popolo, and we will go ours, if you please, by way of the Via del Corso. Take some of these cigars, Monsieur de Morcerf.
035.090 -My faith, with great pleasure, said Albert, for your Italian cigars are even worse than those of the régie. When you come to Paris, I will give you all this back.
035.091 -That is not a refusal; I intend to go there some day, and, since you allow it, I will knock on your door. Come, gentlemen, come, we have no time to lose; it is half past noon, let us go."
035.092 All three got off. Then the coachman took the last orders of his master, and followed the via del Babuino, while the pedestrians went up by the Spanish Steps and the via Frattina, which led them straight between the palace Fiano and the palace Rospoli.
035.093 All the glances of Franz were for the windows of this last palace, he had not forgotten the signal agreed in the Colosseum between the man to the coat and the Transtevere.
035.094 "What are your windows?" he asked the Count in the most natural tone he could muster.
035.095 --The last three," he answered with a carelessness that had nothing to do with affectation; for he could not guess for what purpose this question was made to him.
035.096 Franz's eyes went quickly to the three windows. The side windows were hung in yellow damask, and the middle one in white damask with a red cross.
035.097 The man with the cloak had kept his word to the Transtevere, and there was no longer any doubt: the man with the cloak was indeed the Count.
035.098 The three windows were still empty.
035.099 In addition, preparations were being made on all sides; chairs were being placed, scaffolding was being erected, windows were being stretched. The masks could not appear, the cars could circulate only with the sound of the bell; but one felt the masks behind all the windows, the cars behind all the doors.
035.100 Franz, Albert, and the Count continued down the Rue du Cours. As they approached the Piazza del Popolo, the crowd became thicker, and above the heads of this crowd two things could be seen rising: the obelisk surmounted by a cross which indicates the center of the square, and, in front of the obelisk, just at the point of visual correspondence of the three streets of Babuino, Corso and Ripetta, the two supreme beams of the scaffold, between which shone the rounded iron of the mandaya.
035.101 To the corner of the street one found the steward of the count, who waited for his master.
035.102 The window rented at that exorbitant price undoubtedly of which the count had not wanted to make known to his guests, belonged to the second floor of the great palace, situated between the street del Babuino and the monte Pincio; it was, as we have said, a kind of cabinet of toilet giving in a bedroom; by closing the door of the bedroom, the tenants of the cabinet were at home; on the chairs one had deposited suits of straw mattress in white and blue satin of the most elegant.
035.103 "As you have left me the choice of costumes," said the Count to the two friends, "I have had these prepared for you. First, it is what there will be better worn this year; second, it is what there is more convenient for the confetti, since the flour does not appear there."
035.104 Franz heard the Count's words only imperfectly, and perhaps he did not appreciate to its full value this new graciousness; for all his attention was attracted by the spectacle presented by the piazza del Popolo, and by the terrible instrument which at that hour made its principal ornament.
035.105 It was the first time that Franz had seen a guillotine; we say guillotine, because the Roman mandaya is carved in much the same pattern as our instrument of death. The knife, which has the shape of a crescent which would cut by the convex part, falls from less height, that is all.
035.106 Two men, seated on the rocking board where the condemned man was laid, were having lunch while waiting, and were eating, as far as Franz could see, bread and sausages; one of them lifted the board, drew from it a bottle of wine, drank a glass, and passed the bottle to his comrade; these two men were the executioner's helpers!
035.107 At this appearance alone, Franz felt sweat break out at the roots of his hair.
035.108 The condemned, transported the evening before from the Carceri Nuove to the little church of Santa Maria del Popolo, had spent the night, each assisted by two priests, in a burning chapel closed by a gate, in front of which sentries were posted hourly.
035.109 A double hedge of riflemen placed on each side of the church door extended to the scaffold, around which it rounded, leaving a path about ten feet wide, and around the guillotine a space of about one hundred steps in circumference. All the rest of the square was paved with the heads of men and women. Many women held their children on their shoulders. These children, who exceeded the crowd of all the chest, were admirably placed.
035.110 The Pincio hill seemed a vast amphitheater of which all the steps would have been loaded with spectators; the balconies of the two churches which make the angle of the street del Babuino and the street di Ripetta overflowed with privileged curious people; the steps of the peristyles seemed a moving and multicolored flood that an unceasing tide pushed towards the portico: every asperity of the wall which could give place to a man had its living statue.
035.111 So what the Count said is true, the most curious thing in life is the spectacle of death.
035.112 And yet, instead of the silence that the solemnity of the spectacle seemed to command, a great noise rose from that crowd, a noise composed of laughter, hooting and joyful cries; it was evident again, as the Count had said, that this execution was nothing other than the beginning of the carnival for all the people.
035.113 Suddenly this noise ceased as if by magic, the door of the church had just opened.
035.114 A brotherhood of penitents, each member of which was dressed in a gray sack pierced only at the eyes, and held a lighted candle in his hand, appeared first; at the head walked the leader of the brotherhood.
035.115 Behind the penitents came a tall man. This man was naked, except for a pair of canvas shorts to the left side of which was attached a large knife hidden in its sheath; he carried a heavy iron mace on his right shoulder. This man was the executioner.
035.116 He also had sandals tied to his lower leg by ropes.
035.117 Behind the executioner walked, in the order in which they were to be executed, first Peppino and then Andrea.
035.118 Each was accompanied by two priests.
035.119 Neither of them was blindfolded.
035.120 Peppino walked with a fairly firm step; no doubt he had had notice of what was being prepared for him.
035.121 Andrea was supported under each arm by a priest.
035.122 Both kissed from time to time the crucifix that the confessor presented to them.
035.123 Franz felt, just at this sight, that his legs were missing; he looked at Albert. He was as pale as his shirt, and with a mechanical movement he threw away his cigar, although he had only smoked it halfway.
035.124 The Count alone seemed impassive. There was even more, a slight red tinge seemed to want to pierce the livid pallor of his cheeks.
035.125 His nose dilated like that of a ferocious animal that sniffs blood, and his lips, slightly parted, showed his white teeth, small and sharp like those of a jackal.
035.126 And yet, in spite of all this, his face had an expression of smiling gentleness that Franz had never seen in him; his black eyes especially were admirable in their gentleness and velvetiness.
035.127 However, the two condemned men continued to walk towards the scaffold, and as they advanced one could distinguish the features of their faces. Peppino was a handsome boy of twenty-four to twenty-six years of age, with a sun-tanned complexion and a free and wild look. He carried his head high and seemed to be sniffing the wind to see from which side his deliverer would come.
035.128 Andrea was fat and short: his face, basely cruel, did not indicate any age; he could, however, be about thirty years old. In the prison he had let his beard grow. His head fell back on one of his shoulders, his legs bent under him: his whole being seemed to obey a mechanical movement in which his will was already nothing.
035.129 "It seems to me," said Franz to the Count, "that you announced to me that there would be only one execution.
035.130 --I told you the truth," he replied coldly.
035.131 --But here are two condemned men.
035.132 -- Yes; but of these two condemned men, one is close to death, and the other still has many years to live.
035.133 --It seems to me that if grace is to come, there is no more time to lose.
035.134 --And so it is coming; look," said the Count.
035.135 Indeed, just as Peppino reached the foot of the mandaya, a penitent, who seemed to be late, broke through the hedge without the soldiers obstructing his passage, and, advancing toward the head of the brotherhood, handed him a paper folded in four.
035.136 Peppino's ardent gaze had not lost any of these details; the leader of the brotherhood unfolded the paper, read it and raised his hand.
035.137 "Blessed be the Lord and praised be His Holiness! There is grace of life for one of the condemned.
035.138 --Grace!" cried the people with one cry; "there is grace!"
035.139 At this word of grace, Andrea seemed to leap up and straighten his head.
035.140 "Grace for whom?" he shouted.
035.141 Peppino remained motionless, mute and panting.
035.142 "There is grace from the death penalty for Peppino Rocca Priori," said the head of the brotherhood.
035.143 And he passed the paper to the captain commanding the carabinieri, who, after reading it, gave it back to him.
035.144 "Mercy for Peppino!" cried Andrea, completely drawn out of the state of torpor in which he seemed to be plunged; "why mercy for him and not for me? We were to die together; I had been promised that he would die before me, they have no right to make me die alone, I don't want it!"
035.145 And he tore himself away from the arms of the two priests, writhing, screaming, roaring, and making insane efforts to break the ropes that bound his hands.
035.146 The executioner signaled to his two assistants, who jumped down from the scaffold and came to take hold of the condemned man.
035.147 "What's the matter?" asked Franz of the Count.
035.148 For, as all this happened in Roman dialect, he had not understood very well.
035.149 "What is it?" said the count, "don't you understand well? It is that this human creature who is going to die is furious that his fellow man does not die with him, and that, if he were allowed to do so, he would tear him up with his nails and with his teeth rather than let him enjoy the life of which he is going to be deprived. O men! men! race of crocodiles! as Karl Moor says," cried the Count, extending both fists towards the whole crowd, "that I know you well there, and that at all times you are well worthy of yourselves!"
035.150 Indeed, Andrea and the two executioner's helpers were rolling in the dust, the condemned man still shouting, "He must die, I want him to die! They don't have the right to kill me alone!"
035.151 "Look, look," continued the count, seizing each of the two young men by the hand, "look, for, on my soul, it is curious, here was a man who was resigned to his fate, who was walking to the scaffold, who was going to die like a coward, it is true, but at last he was going to die without resistance and without recrimination: do you know what gave him some strength? Do you know what consoled him? Do you know what made him take his torment in patience? it is that another shared his anguish; it is that another was going to die like him; it is that another was going to die before him! Lead two sheep to the slaughter, two oxen to the slaughterhouse, and make one of them understand that his companion will not die, the sheep will bleat with joy, the ox will bellow with pleasure, but the man, the man whom God made in his image, the man to whom God has imposed as his first, only, supreme law, the love of his neighbor, the man to whom God has given a voice to express his thoughts, what will be his first cry when he learns that his companion is saved? A blasphemy. Honor to man, that masterpiece of nature, that king of creation!"
035.152 And the Count burst out laughing, but a terrible laugh that indicated that he must have suffered horribly to come to laugh like that.
035.153 However the fight continued, and it was something awful to see. The two valets were carrying Andrea to the scaffold; all the people had taken sides against him, and twenty thousand voices were shouting at once: "Death! death!"
035.154 Franz threw himself back; but the Count took hold of his arm and held him before the window.
035.155 "What are you doing?" he said to him; "pity? it is, my faith, well placed! If you heard the cry of the mad dog, you would take your gun, you would throw yourself into the street, you would kill without mercy at point-blank range the poor beast, who, in the end, would only be guilty of having been bitten by another dog, and of giving back what had been done to him: and here you have pity on a man that no other man has bitten, and who nevertheless has killed his benefactor, and who now, unable to kill because his hands are tied, wants at all costs to see his fellow captive, his comrade in misfortune, die! No, no, look, look."
035.156 The recommendation had become almost useless; Franz was as if fascinated by the horrible spectacle. The two valets had carried the condemned man to the scaffold, and there, in spite of his efforts, his bites, his cries, they had forced him to kneel. During this time, the executioner had placed himself on the side and the mace in stop; then, on a sign, the two assistants moved away. The condemned wanted to get up, but before he had the time, the mace fell on his left temple; one heard a dull thud, the patient fell like an ox, face down, then with a backlash, turned over on his back. Then the executioner dropped his mace, drew the knife from his belt, opened his throat with a single blow, and, climbing at once to his belly, began to knead it with his feet.
035.157 With each pressure, a stream of blood shot out of the condemned man's neck.
035.158 This time Franz could not stand it any longer; he threw himself back and fell into an armchair, half fainting.
035.159 Albert, with his eyes closed, remained standing, but clinging to the window curtains.
035.160 The Count was standing and triumphant as the evil angel.
036.000 The carnival of Rome.
036.001 When Franz came to, he found Albert drinking a glass of water, which his pallor indicated that he needed very much, and the Count who was already changing into his straw suit. He cast his eyes mechanically over the square; everything had disappeared, the scaffold, the executioners, the victims; only the people remained, noisy, busy, joyful; the bell of Monte Citorio, which rang only for the death of the pope and the opening of the mascherata, was ringing in full flight.
036.002 "Well," he asked the Count, "what has happened?
036.003 --Nothing, absolutely nothing, he said, as you can see; only the carnival has begun, let us dress quickly.
036.004 --In effect, Franz answered the Count, all that remains of this horrible scene is the trace of a dream.
036.005 --It is that it is not other than a dream, that a nightmare, that you had.
036.006 --Yes, I did; but the convict?
036.007 --That's a dream too; only he stayed asleep, him, while you woke up; and who can say which of you is the privileged one?
036.008 --But Peppino, asked Franz, what has become of him?
036.009 --Peppino is a sensible boy who has not the slightest self-esteem, and who, against the habit of men who are furious when they are not taken care of, was delighted to see that the general attention was focused on his comrade; he consequently took advantage of this distraction to slip into the crowd and disappear, without even thanking the worthy priests who had accompanied him. Man is definitely a very ungrateful and selfish animal.... But get dressed; here, you see that M. de Morcerf is giving you an example."
036.010 Indeed, Albert mechanically passed his taffeta pants over his black pants and his patent boots.
036.011 "Well! Albert," asked Franz, "are you really doing something crazy? Let's see, answer frankly.
036.012 --No, he said, but in truth I am at ease now to have seen such a thing, and I understand what the Count was saying: that, when one has once been able to get used to such a spectacle, it is the only one that still gives emotions.
036.013 --And it is only at this moment that one can make studies of character, said the count; on the first step of the scaffold, death tears off the mask that one has worn all one's life, and the true face appears. It is necessary to admit it, that of Andrea was not beautiful to see.... The hideous rascal!... Let us dress, gentlemen, let us dress!"
036.014 It would have been ridiculous to Franz to make the small mistress and not to follow the example which his two companions gave him. He therefore passed in his turn his costume and put on his mask, which was certainly not paler than his face.
036.015 The toilet finished, one went down. The carriage was waiting at the door, full of confetti and bouquets.
036.016 They got in line.
036.017 It is difficult to imagine a more complete opposition than that which had just taken place. Instead of this spectacle of dark and silent death, the Piazza del Popolo presented the aspect of a crazy and noisy orgy. A crowd of masks went out, overflowing on all the sides, escaping by the doors, descending by the windows; the carriages unloaded at all the corners of street, loaded with pierrots, harlequins, dominoes, marquises, Transtevères, grotesques, knights, peasants: all shouting, gesticulating, throwing eggs full of flour, confetti, bouquets; attacking with word and projectile friends and strangers, known and unknown, without anyone having the right to get angry about it, without anyone doing anything other than laughing about it.
036.018 Franz and Albert were like men who, to distract them from a violent sorrow, would be led to an orgy, and who, as they drank and got drunk, felt a veil thicken between the past and the present. They still saw, or rather they continued to feel in themselves the reflection of what they had seen. But little by little the general intoxication won them: it seemed to them that their staggering reason was going to abandon them; they felt a strange need to take their share of this noise, of this movement, of this vertigo. A handful of confetti which arrived at Morcerf from a neighboring carriage, and which, covering him and his two companions with dust, pricked his neck and all the portion of the face which the mask did not guarantee, as if a hundred pins had been thrown at him, finished by pushing him into the general struggle in which all the masks they met were already engaged. He got up in his turn in the car, he drew with full hands in the bags, and, with all the vigor and the address of which he was capable, he sent in his turn eggs and dragees to his neighbors.
036.019 From then on, the fight was on. The memory of what they had seen half an hour before was completely erased from the minds of the two young men, so much the variegated, moving, senseless spectacle which they had before their eyes had come to distract them. As for the Count of Monte Cristo, he had never, as we have said, seemed impressed for a single moment.
036. 020 Indeed, let us imagine this great and beautiful street of the Cours, lined from one end to the other with four or five-story palaces with all their balconies trimmed with tapestries, with all their windows draped; at these balconies and at these windows, three hundred thousand spectators, Romans, Italians, foreigners from the four parts of the world: all the aristocracies gathered, aristocracies of birth, of money, of genius; charming women, who, under the influence of this spectacle themselves, bend over the balconies, lean out of the windows, rain on the passing carriages a hail of confetti that is returned to them in bouquets; the atmosphere all thickened with sugared almonds that go down and flowers that go up; and then on the pavement of the streets a joyous crowd, incessant; mad, with insane costumes: gigantic cabbages which walk, heads of buffaloes which roar on bodies of men, dogs which seem to walk on the feet of the back; in the middle of all that a mask which rises, and, in this temptation of Saint Antoine dreamed by Callot, some Astarté which shows a ravishing figure which one wants to follow and from which one is separated by species of demons similar to those which one sees in its dreams, and one will have a weak idea of what is the carnival of Rome.
036.021 At the second turn the count made stop the car and asked his companions the permission to leave them, leaving his car at their disposal. Franz raised the eyes: one was in front of the palace Rospoli; and to the window of the medium, to that which was draped of a piece of white damask with a red cross was a blue domino, under which the imagination of Franz represented without sorrow the beautiful Greek of the theater Argentina.
036.022 "Gentlemen," said the Count, jumping to the ground, "when you are tired of being actors and want to become spectators again, you know that you have a place at my windows. In the meantime, dispose of my coachman, my carriage and my servants."
036.023 We forgot to say that the Count's coachman was gravely dressed in a black bear skin, exactly the same as Odry's in _The Bear and the Pasha_, and that the two lackeys who stood behind the carriage possessed green monkey suits, perfectly suited to their sizes, and spring masks with which they made faces at passers-by.
036.024 Franz thanked the count for his kind offer: as for Albert, he was in coquetry with a full carriage of Roman peasant girls, stopped, like the count's, by one of those rests so common in the lines and which he crushed with bouquets.
036.025 Unfortunately for him the file resumed its movement, and while he descended towards the Piazza del Popolo, the car which had drawn his attention went up towards the palace of Venice.
036.026 "Ah, my dear!" he said to Franz, "didn't you see?
036.027 --What?" asked Franz.
036.028 --Here, this carriage which is going away all loaded with Roman peasants.
036.029 --No.
036.030 --Well, I'm sure they're lovely women.
036.031 --What a misfortune that you are masked, my dear Albert," said Franz, "it was the moment to make up for your disappointments in love!
036.032 --Oh!" he replied, half laughing, half convinced, "I do hope that the carnival will not pass without bringing me some compensation.
036.033 In spite of this hope of Albert's, the whole day passed without any other adventure than the encounter, twice or thrice renewed, of the carriage with the Roman peasant girls. At one of these meetings, either by chance or by Albert's calculation, his mask came off.
036.034 At this meeting he took the rest of the bouquet and threw it into the carriage.
036.035 Undoubtedly one of the charming women whom Albert guessed under the coquettish costume of the peasants was touched by this gallantry, for in her turn, when the carriage of the two friends passed again, she threw a bouquet of violets into it.
036.036 Albert rushed on the bouquet. As Franz had no reason to believe that it was for him, he let Albert seize it. Albert put it victoriously in his buttonhole, and the car continued its triumphant course.
036.037 "Well," said Franz, "here is the beginning of an adventure!
036.038 --Reject as much as you like, he replied, but in truth I think so; so I never leave this bouquet.
036.039 --Forgive me, I think so!" said Franz, laughing, "it's a sign of recognition."
036.040 The joke, moreover, soon took on a character of reality, for when, still led by the line, Franz and Albert again crossed the _contadine_ car, the one who had thrown the bouquet to Albert clapped her hands on seeing it in her buttonhole.
036.041 "Bravo, my dear! bravo!" said Franz to him, "this is a wonderful preparation! Do you want me to leave you and is it more pleasant for you to be alone?
036.042 -- No, he said, let's not rush into anything; I don't want to let myself be taken like a fool at a first demonstration, at a rendezvous under the clock as we say for the Opera ball. If the beautiful peasant girl wants to go further, we will meet her tomorrow, or rather she will meet us. Then she will give me a sign of existence, and I will see what I have to do.
036.043 --In truth, my dear Albert," said Franz, "you are as wise as Nestor and as prudent as Ulysses; and if your Circe succeeds in changing you into some kind of beast, she will have to be very skillful or very powerful."
036.044 Albert was right. The beautiful stranger had probably resolved not to push the plot any further that day; for, although the young people made several more turns, they did not see again the carriage they were looking for with their eyes: it had probably disappeared down one of the adjacent streets.
036.045 Then they returned to the Rospoli palace, but the count had also disappeared with the blue domino. The two windows stretched out in yellow damask continued, moreover, to be occupied by people whom he had undoubtedly invited.
036.046 At this moment, the same bell which had sounded the opening of the mascherata sounded the retreat. The line of the Corso broke up at once, and in an instant all the carriages disappeared into the side streets.
036.047 Franz and Albert were at this moment in front of the via delle Maratte.
036.048 The coachman took it without saying anything, and, gaining the Spanish Steps along the Poli Palace, he stopped in front of the hotel.
036.049 Master Pastrini came to receive his guests on the doorstep.
036.050 Franz's first concern was to inquire about the Count and to express his regret at not having taken him back in time, but Pastrini reassured him that the Count of Monte Cristo had ordered a second carriage for him, and that this carriage had picked him up at four o'clock at the Rospoli Palace. He was in addition charged, on his behalf, to offer to the two friends the key of his box at the Argentina theater.
036.051 Franz questioned Albert on his arrangements, but Albert had great projects to carry out before thinking of going to the theater; consequently, instead of answering, he inquired if Master Pastrini could provide him with a tailor.
036.052 "A tailor," asked our host, "and for what?
036.053 --To make us Roman peasant clothes by tomorrow, as elegant as possible," said Albert.
036.054 Master Pastrini shook his head.
036.055 "To make you two suits by tomorrow!" he exclaimed, "I beg Your Excellencies' pardon, that is a French request; two suits!" When in eight days you would certainly not find a tailor who would agree to sew six buttons on a vest, would you pay him one ecu a piece for those buttons!
036.056 --So I must give up getting the clothes I want?
036.057 -- No, because we will have these clothes ready-made. Let me take care of that, and tomorrow you will find when you wake up a collection of hats, jackets and breeches with which you will be satisfied.
036.058 -My dear," said Franz to Albert, "let us report to our host; he has already proved to us that he is a man of resources; let us therefore dine quietly, and after dinner let us go and see _l'Italienne à Alger_.
036.059 --Go for the _Italian at Algiers_, said Albert; but think, Master Pastrini, that I and sir," he continued, pointing to Franz, "put the greatest importance on having tomorrow the clothes we asked you for."
036.060 The innkeeper affirmed one last time to his guests that they had nothing to worry about and that they would be served according to their wishes; whereupon Franz and Albert went upstairs to get rid of their straw mattress suits.
036.061 Albert, while stripping his, clutched his bouquet of violets with the greatest care: it was his sign of gratitude for the next day.
036.062 The two friends sat down to dinner; but, while dining, Albert could not help noticing the notable difference that existed between the respective merits of Master Pastrini's cook and that of the Count of Monte Cristo. The truth forced Franz to admit, despite the prejudices he seemed to have against the Count, that the parallel was not to the advantage of Master Pastrini's chef.
036.063 At the dessert, the servant inquired about the time at which the young people wanted the carriage. Albert and Franz looked at each other, genuinely afraid of being indiscreet. The servant understood them.
036.064 "His Excellency the Count of Monte Cristo," he told them, "has given positive orders that the carriage is to remain all day at the orders of Their Lordships; Their Lordships may therefore dispose of it without fear of being indiscreet."
036.065 The young men resolved to take full advantage of the Count's courtesy, and ordered the carriage to be harnessed, while they went to substitute an evening toilet for their day's toilet, which had been so slightly crumpled by the numerous fights they had engaged in.
036.066 This precaution taken, they went to the Argentina theater, and installed themselves in the box of the count.
036.067 During the first act, the Countess G... entered her own; her first glance went to the side where the day before she had seen the Count, so that she saw Franz and Albert in the dressing room of the one on whose account she had expressed, twenty-four hours ago, to Franz, a so strange opinion.
036.068 Her spyglass was directed at him so fiercely that Franz saw that it would be cruel to delay any longer in satisfying his curiosity; so, availing themselves of the privilege accorded to the spectators of Italian theaters, which consists in making the theaters their reception rooms, the two friends left their dressing room to go and pay their respects to the Countess.
036.069 No sooner had they entered her dressing room than she motioned to Franz to take the place of honor.
036.070 Albert, in turn, took his place behind.
036.071 "Well," she said, hardly giving Franz time to sit down, "it seems that you had nothing more urgent than to make the acquaintance of the new Lord Ruthwen, and that you are the best friends in the world?
036.072 -While we are not so far advanced in a mutual intimacy as you say, I cannot deny, Madam Countess," replied Franz, "that we have been abusing his kindness all day.
036.073 --What do you mean, all day?
036.074 --My goodness, that is the word: this morning we accepted his breakfast, during the whole mascherata we ran the Corso in his carriage, finally this evening we come to the spectacle in his dressing room.
036.075 --So you know him?
036.076 -- Yes and no.
036.077 --How so?
036.078 --It's a long story.
036.079 --What will you tell me?
036.080 --It would scare you too much.
036.081 --Another reason.
036.082 --At least wait until this story has an ending.
036.083 --So, I like complete stories. In the meantime, how did you come into contact with him? Who introduced you to him?
036.084 --No one; on the contrary, it was he who introduced us to him.
036.085 --When?
036.086 -- Last night, when I left you.
036.087 -- By what intermediary?
036.088 --Oh, my God! through the very prosaic intermediary of our host!
036.089 --So he is staying at the Hotel d'Espagne, like you?
036.090 -- Not only in the same hotel, but on the same square.
036.091 --What is his name? For no doubt you know his name?
036.092 --Perfectly, the Count of Monte Cristo.
036.093 --What is that name? It is not a racial name.
036.094 -- No, it is the name of an island which he has bought.
036.095 --And he is a count?
036.096 --Tuscan count.
036.097 --Well, we'll swallow that one with the others," said the Countess, who was from one of the oldest families in the vicinity of Venice; "and what kind of man is he anyway?
036.098 --Ask the Viscount de Morcerf.
036.099 --You hear, sir, I am being sent back to you, said the Countess.
036.100 --We would be difficult if we did not find him charming, madam, replied Albert; a friend of ten years would not have done more for us than he has done, and that with a grace, a delicacy, a courtesy which truly indicate a man of the world.
036.101 "Come," said the Countess, laughing, "you will see that my vampire is simply some newly enriched person who wants to be forgiven for his millions, and who has taken Lara's look so that he will not be mistaken for M. de Rothschild. And her, did you see her?
036.102 --Who?" asked Franz, smiling.
036.103 --The beautiful Greek girl from yesterday.
036.104 --No. We did, I think, hear the sound of her guzla, but she remained perfectly invisible.
036.105 --When you say invisible, my dear Franz," said Albert, "it is simply to be mysterious. Who do you think that blue domino was at the window covered with white damask?
036.106 --And where was this white damask window?
036.107 --In the Rospoli Palace.
036.108 -- So the Count had three windows in the Rospoli Palace?
036.109 --Yes. Have you been on Rue du Cours?
036.110 --Surely.
036.111 -- Well, did you notice two windows with yellow damask and one with white damask and a red cross? These three windows belonged to the Count.
036.112 --Ah, but is this man a mogul? Do you know what three windows like these are worth for eight days of carnival, and in the Rospoli Palace, that is, in the most beautiful situation on the Corso?
036.113 --Two or three hundred Roman ecus.
036.114 --Say two or three thousand.
036.115 --Ah, hell.
036.116 --And is it his island that makes him this fine income?
036.117 --His island? It doesn't bring in a bajocco.
036.118 --Why did he buy it then?
036.119 --From a whim.
036.120 --So he's an original?
036.121 -The fact is, says Albert, that he seemed to me rather eccentric. If he lived in Paris, if he frequented our shows, I would tell you, my dear, either that he is a bad joker who poses, or that he is a poor devil whom literature has lost; in truth, this morning he made two or three sorties worthy of Didier or Antony."
036.122 At this moment a visitor entered, and, according to custom, Franz gave up his place to the newcomer; this circumstance, besides the displacement, had the further result of changing the subject of the conversation.
036.123 An hour later, the two friends returned to the hotel. Master Pastrini had already taken care of their disguises for the next day and promised them that they would be satisfied with his intelligent activity.
036.124 Indeed, the next day at nine o'clock he entered Franz's room with a tailor in charge of eight or ten Roman peasant costumes. The two friends chose two such suits, which were about their size, and instructed their host to have them sew about twenty yards of ribbons to each of their hats, and to procure for them two of those charming silk scarves with the transverse stripes and bright colors with which common men, on feast days, are accustomed to clasp their waists.
036.125 Albert was anxious to see how his new dress would fit him: it was a jacket and breeches of blue velvet, stockings with embroidered corners, shoes with buckles and a silk vest. Albert could not but gain by this picturesque costume; and when his belt tightened his elegant waist, when his hat, slightly tilted to one side, let fall on his shoulder streams of ribbons, Franz was forced to admit that the costume is often for much in the physical superiority which we grant to certain people. The Turks, so picturesque in the past with their long, brightly colored robes, are they not hideous now with their blue buttoned frock coats and their Greek skullcaps which make them look like bottles of wine with a red seal?
036.126 Franz paid his compliments to Albert, who, incidentally, was standing in front of the mirror, smiling at himself with an unequivocal air of satisfaction.
036.127 They had reached this point when the Count of Monte Cristo entered.
036.128 "Gentlemen," he said to them, "since, however pleasant a companion of pleasure may be, freedom is still more pleasant, I have come to tell you that for today and for the next few days I am leaving at your disposal the carriage which you used yesterday. Our host must have told you that I had three or four of them at his place, so you don't deprive me of them: use them freely, either to go to your pleasure or to go to your business. Our rendezvous, if we have anything to say to each other, will be at the Rospoli Palace."
036.129 The two young men wanted to make some observation to him, but they really had no good reason to refuse an offer that was moreover agreeable to them. So they finally accepted.
036.130 The Count of Monte Cristo stayed with them for about fifteen minutes, talking about everything with extreme ease. He was, as has already been remarked, well versed in the literature of all countries. A glance at the walls of his salon proved to Franz and Albert that he was a lover of paintings. A few unpretentious words, which he dropped in passing, proved to them that the sciences were not foreign to him; he seemed to have been particularly interested in chemistry.
036.131 The two friends had no intention of giving the count the lunch he had given them; it would have been too bad a joke to offer him, in exchange for his excellent table, the very mediocre ordinary of Master Pastrini. They told him so quite frankly, and he received their apologies as a man who appreciated their delicacy.
036.132 Albert was delighted with the manners of the count, whom only his knowledge prevented him from recognizing as a true gentleman. The freedom to dispose entirely of the carriage filled him above all with joy: he had his sights set on his graceful peasant girls; and, as they had appeared to him the day before in a very elegant carriage, he was not angry to continue to appear on this point with them on an equal footing.
036.133 At half past one the two young men got off; the coachman and the lackeys had had the idea of putting their livery clothes on their animal skins, which made them look even more grotesque than the day before, and which earned them all the compliments of Franz and Albert.
036.134 Albert had sentimentally tied his bouquet of faded violets to his buttonhole.
036.135 At the first sound of the bell, they left and rushed down Via Vittoria into the Via del Corso.
036.136 On the second turn, a bunch of fresh violets, which left a carriage loaded with straw mats, and which fell into the Count's carriage, indicated to Albert that, like him and his friend, the peasant women of the day before had changed costume, and that, either by chance or by a feeling similar to that which had made him act, while he had gallantly taken their costume, they, on their side, had taken his.
036.137 Albert put the fresh bouquet in the place of the other, but he kept the faded bouquet in his hand; and when he passed the carriage again, he raised it lovingly to his lips: an action which seemed to greatly recreate not only the one who had thrown it to him, but also his crazy companions.
036.138 The day was no less animated than the day before: it is probable that a profound observer would have recognized an increase in noise and gaiety. For a moment the Count was seen at the window; but when the carriage passed again he had already disappeared.
036.139 It goes without saying that the exchange of coquetries between Albert and the doormat with the bouquets of violets lasted all day.
036.140 In the evening Franz came home and found a letter from the embassy, announcing that he would have the honor of being received the next day by His Holiness. On every previous trip he had made to Rome, he had asked for and obtained the same favor; and, as much out of religion as out of gratitude, he had not wanted to touch the bar in the capital of the Christian world without placing his respectful homage at the feet of one of the successors of St. Peter who gave the rare example of all virtues.
036.141 It was not a question, therefore, for him that day of thinking about the carnival; for, in spite of the kindness with which he surrounds his greatness, it is always with a respect full of deep emotion that one prepares to bow before this noble and holy old man who is called Gregory XVI.
036.142 On leaving the Vatican, Franz went straight back to the hotel, avoiding even passing through the Rue du Cours. He carried with him a treasure of pious thoughts, for which contact with the mad joys of the mascherata would have been a profanation.
036.143 At ten minutes past five, Albert returned. He was at the height of his joy; the doormat had resumed her peasant costume, and on passing Albert's carriage she had raised her mask.
036.144 She was charming.
036.145 Franz paid Albert his sincere compliments; he received them as a man to whom they were due. He had recognized, he said, by certain signs of inimitable elegance, that his beautiful stranger must belong to the highest aristocracy.
036.146 He was determined to write to her the next day.
036.147 Franz, while receiving this confidence, noticed that Albert seemed to have something to ask him, and yet he hesitated to address this request to her. He insisted, declaring to him in advance that he was ready to make, for the benefit of his happiness, all the sacrifices that would be in his power. Albert made him wait just long enough to be polite: then at last he admitted to Franz that he would do him a favor by leaving him the carriage alone for the next day.
036.148 Albert attributed to the absence of his friend the extreme kindness which the beautiful peasant girl had had to lift her mask.
036.149 It is understandable that Franz was not so selfish as to stop Albert in the middle of an adventure that promised to be both so pleasing to his curiosity and so flattering to his self-esteem. He knew enough of his worthy friend's perfect indiscretion to be sure that he would keep him informed of the minutest details of his good fortune; and as, in the two or three years that he had been traveling through Italy in all directions, he had never had the chance even to sketch out such an intrigue on his own account, Franz was not angry to learn how things went on in such cases.
036.150 So he promised Albert that the next day he would be content to watch the spectacle from the windows of the Rospoli Palace.
036.151 Indeed, the next day he saw Albert pass by again and again. He had an enormous bouquet which without doubt he had charged to be the bearer of his amorous epistle. This probability became a certainty when Franz saw the same bouquet again, remarkable for a circle of white camellias, in the hands of a charming doormat dressed in pink satin.
036.152 Also in the evening it was no longer joy, it was delirium. Albert had no doubt that the beautiful stranger would answer him in the same way. Franz met his wishes by telling him that all this noise was tiring him, and that he had decided to spend the next day reviewing his album and taking notes.
036.153 Besides, Albert had not been mistaken in his predictions: the next evening Franz saw him enter his room in one bound, mechanically shaking a square of paper that he was holding by one of its corners.
036.154 "Well," he said, "was I mistaken?
036.155 --She answered?" exclaimed Franz.
036.156 --Read."
036.157 This word was pronounced with an intonation impossible to render. Franz took the bill and read:
036.158 "Tuesday evening, at seven o'clock, get out of your car in front of the via dei Pontefici, and follow the Roman peasant girl who will snatch your moccoletto. When you arrive on the first step of the church of San-Giacomo, be careful, so that she can recognize you, to tie a pink ribbon on the shoulder of your straw suit.
036.159 "By then you will not see me again.
036.160 "Consistency and discretion."
036.161 "Well," he said to Franz, when Franz had finished this reading, "what do you think of that, dear friend?
036.162 --But I think," replied Franz, "that the thing takes on the character of a very pleasant adventure.
036.163 -I think so too, said Albert, and I am very much afraid that you will go alone to the Duke of Bracciano's ball."
036.164 Franz and Albert had each received an invitation from the famous Roman banker that morning.
036.165 "Beware, my dear Albert," said Franz, "all the aristocracy will be at the Duke's; and if your beautiful stranger is truly of the aristocracy, she will not be able to dispense with appearing there.
036.166 -- Whether she appears there or not, I maintain my opinion of her," continued Albert. Did you read the bill?
036.167 -- Yes.
036.168 --You know the poor education that the women of the mezzo cito receive in Italy?"
036.169 This is what the bourgeoisie is called.
036.170 "Yes," said Franz again.
036.171 --Well, read this bill again, examine the handwriting, and look for a mistake either in language or in spelling."
036.172 Indeed, the handwriting was charming and the spelling impeccable.
036.173 "You are predestined," said Franz to Albert, returning the bill to him for the second time.
036.174 -Laugh all you want, joke all you want," said Albert, "I am in love.
036.175 --Oh, my God! you frighten me! cried Franz, and I see that not only will I go alone to the Duke of Bracciano's ball, but that I might well return alone to Florence.
036.176 -The fact is, if my stranger is as amiable as she is beautiful, I declare to you that I am settling in Rome for six weeks at least. I adore Rome, and besides I always had a marked taste for archaeology.
036.177 --Come on, another meeting or two like that, and I don't despair of seeing you a member of the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres."
036.178 No doubt Albert was going to seriously discuss his rights to the academic chair, but the two young men were told that they were served. Now, love in Albert was in no way contrary to appetite. So he and his friend hurried to the table, even if it meant resuming the discussion after dinner.
036.179 After dinner, the Count of Monte Cristo was announced. For two days the young people had not seen him. An affair, said Master Pastrini, had called him to Civita-Vecchia. He had left the evening before, and had only been back an hour before.
036.180 The Count was charming; either he was observing himself, or the occasion did not awaken in him the acrimonious fibers which certain circumstances had already caused to resound two or three times in his bitter words, he was more or less like everyone else. This man was a real enigma to Franz. The Count could not doubt that the young traveler had recognized him; and yet not a word, since their new meeting, seemed to indicate in his mouth that he remembered having seen him elsewhere. For his part, however much Franz might have wished to allude to their first meeting, the fear of being disagreeable to a man who had showered him and his friend with kindnesses held him back; he therefore continued to keep to the same reserve as he had.
036.181 He had learned that the two friends had wanted to have a box in the Argentina theater, and he had told them that everything was rented.
036.182 Consequently, he brought them the key to his own; at least that was the apparent reason for his visit.
036.183 Franz and Albert made some difficulty, alleging fear of depriving him of it himself, but the Count replied that since he was going to the Palli Theater that evening, his box at the Argentina Theater would be lost if they did not take advantage of it.
036.184 This assurance determined the two friends to accept.
036.185 Franz had gradually become accustomed to the Count's pallor, which had struck him so strongly the first time he had seen him. He could not help but do justice to the beauty of his severe head, whose pallor was the only defect or perhaps the main quality. A true hero of Byron, Franz could not, we will not say see him, but only think of him without picturing that dark face on Manfred's shoulders or under Lara's hat. He had that crease in his forehead which indicates the incessant presence of a bitter thought; he had those ardent eyes which read the depths of souls; he had that haughty and mocking lip which gives to the words which escape from it that peculiar character which makes them engrave themselves deeply in the memory of those who hear them.
036.186 The Count was no longer young; he was at least forty years old, and yet it was perfectly understood that he was made to prevail over the young people with whom he would find himself. In fact, it was that, by a last resemblance to the fantastic heroes of the English poet, the Count seemed to have the gift of fascination.
036.187 Albert did not dwell on how happy he and Franz had been to meet such a man. Franz was less enthusiastic, and yet he felt the influence that every superior man has on the minds of those around him.
036.188 He thought of the plan which the Count had already expressed two or three times to go to Paris, and he had no doubt that with his eccentric character, his characteristic face and his colossal fortune the Count would produce the greatest effect there.
036.189 And yet he did not wish to be in Paris when he came there.
036.190 The evening passed as evenings usually do at the theater in Italy, not listening to the singers, but making visits and talking. The Countess G... wanted to bring the conversation back to the Count, but Franz announced that he had something much more new to tell her, and, in spite of the demonstrations of false modesty in which Albert indulged, he told the Countess of the great event which for three days had been the object of the preoccupation of the two friends.
036.191 As these intrigues are not rare in Italy, at least if one is to believe the travelers, the countess did not make the least incredulous, and congratulated Albert on the beginnings of an adventure which promised to finish in a so satisfactory way.
036.192 They parted, promising to meet again at the Duke of Bracciano's ball, to which all of Rome was invited.
036.193 The lady with the bouquet kept her promise: neither the next day nor the day after that did she give Albert any sign of existence.
036.194 Finally came Tuesday, the last and most noisy day of the carnival. On Tuesday, the theaters open at ten o'clock in the morning; for, after eight o'clock in the evening, Lent is entered. On Tuesday, all those who, for lack of time, money, or enthusiasm, have not yet taken part in the preceding festivities, mingle in the bacchanal, allow themselves to be drawn into the orgy, and contribute their share of noise and motion to the general movement and noise.
036.195 From two o'clock until five o'clock, Franz and Albert followed the line, exchanging handfuls of confetti with the carriages of the opposite line and the pedestrians who circulated between the feet of the horses, between the wheels of the carriages, without there being in the midst of this frightful mob a single accident, a single dispute, a single brawl. The Italians are the people par excellence in this respect. Parties are for them real parties. The author of this story, who has lived in Italy for five or six years, does not remember ever having seen a solemnity disturbed by a single one of those events which always serve as a corollary to ours.
036.196 Albert was triumphant in his straw suit. He had on his shoulder a pink ribbon bow whose ends fell to his hocks. To avoid confusion between him and Franz, the latter had kept his Roman peasant costume.
036.197 The more the day progressed, the greater the tumult became; there was not on all these pavements, in all these cars, at all these windows, a mouth which remained mute, an arm which remained idle, it was truly a human storm composed of a thunder of cries and a hail of sweets, bouquets, eggs, oranges, flowers.
036.198 At three o'clock, the sound of boxes being fired at once in the Place du Peuple and in the Palace of Venice, piercing this horrible tumult with great difficulty, announced that the races were about to begin.
036.199 The races, like the moccoli, are one of the particular episodes of the last days of the carnival. At the noise of these boxes the cars broke up their ranks immediately and took refuge each one in the transverse street nearest to the place where they were.
036.200 All these movements were made with inconceivable skill and marvelous rapidity, and without the police bothering in the least to assign each one to his post or to mark out his route.
036.201 The pedestrians stuck to the palaces, and then there was a great noise of horses and saber scabbards.
036.202 A squad of carabinieri, fifteen abreast, galloped across the entire width of the Via del Corso, sweeping it to make way for the barberi. When the squad arrived at the palace of Venice, the sound of another battery of boxes announced that the street was free.
036.203 Almost at once, in the middle of an immense, universal, unheard-of clamor, one saw seven or eight horses pass like shadows, excited by the clamor of three hundred thousand people and by the iron chestnuts which leaped on their backs; then the cannon of the Saint-Ange castle fired three shots: it was to announce that the number three had won.
036.204 Immediately, without any other signal than that one, the cars began to move again, flowing back towards the Corso, overflowing through all the streets like torrents that are contained for a moment and which all flow back together into the bed of the river they are feeding, and the immense flood resumed, more rapid than ever, its course between the two granite banks.
036.205 Only a new element of noise and movement had still mingled with this crowd: the merchants of moccoli had just entered in scene.
036.206 The moccoli or moccoletti are candles that vary in size from the Paschal candle to the cellar rat, and that awaken in the actors of the great scene that ends the Roman carnival two opposite preoccupations:
036.207 1º That of keeping their moccoletto lit;
036.208 2º That to extinguish the moccoletto of the others.
036.209 The moccoletto is like life: man has only found one way to transmit it, and that way comes from God.
036.210 But he has discovered a thousand ways to take it away; it is true that for this supreme operation the devil has come to his aid to some extent.
036.211 The moccoletto lights up when it is brought close to any light.
036.212 But who will describe the thousand ways invented to extinguish the moccoletto, the gigantic bellows, the monster extinguishers, the superhuman fans?
036.213 So everyone hurried to buy moccoletti, Franz and Albert as well as the others.
036.214 Night was approaching rapidly; and already, at the cry of: _Moccoli_! repeated by the shrill voices of a thousand industrialists, two or three stars began to shine above the crowd. It was like a signal.
036.215 At the end of ten minutes, fifty thousand lights flickered down from the Palace of Venice to the Piazza del Popolo, and up from the Piazza del Popolo to the Palace of Venice.
036.216 It looked like the festival of the will-o'-the-wisps.
036.217 One cannot form an idea of this aspect if one has not seen it.
036.218 Suppose all the stars were to come down from the sky and mingle on the earth in a senseless dance.
036.219 All of this accompanied by cries such as have never been heard by human ears on the rest of the surface of the globe.
036.220 It is especially at this moment that there is no longer any social distinction. The facchino attaches himself to the prince, the prince to the Transtevera, the Transtevera to the burgher, each one blowing, extinguishing, relighting. If the old Aeolus appeared at this moment, he would be proclaimed king of the moccoli, and Aquilon heir presumptive of the crown.
036.221 This mad and flaming race lasted about two hours; the street of the Course was illuminated as in broad daylight, one could distinguish the features of the spectators up to the third and fourth floor.
036.222 Five minutes after five minutes Albert pulled his watch; finally it marked seven o'clock.
036.223 The two friends were just at the Via dei Pontefici; Albert jumped out of the carriage, his moccoletto in his hand.
036.224 Two or three masks wanted to approach him to extinguish it or to tear it off him, but, as a skilful boxer, Albert sent them one after the other rolling to ten steps of him while continuing his race towards the church of San-Giacomo.
036.225 The steps were full of curious people and masks who were fighting to see who could snatch the torch from their hands. Franz followed Albert with his eyes, and saw him put his foot on the first step; then almost immediately a mask, wearing the well-known costume of the peasant girl with the bouquet, extended his arm, and, without his making any resistance this time, took the moccoletto from him.
036.226 Franz was too far away to hear the words they exchanged, but they were certainly not hostile, for he saw Albert and the peasant woman walk away arm in arm.
036.227 For a while he followed them through the crowd, but at Via Macello he lost sight of them.
036.228 Suddenly the sound of the bell that signals the closing of the carnival rang out, and at the same moment all the moccoli were extinguished as if by magic. It seemed as if a single, immense gust of wind had annihilated everything.
036.229 Franz found himself in the deepest darkness.
036.230 At once all the shouting stopped, as if the powerful wind that had blown away the lights had blown away the noise.
036.231 All that could be heard was the rolling of the carriages that were taking the masks home; all that could be seen were the few lights that shone behind the windows.
036.232 The carnival was over.
037.000 The catacombs of San Sebastian.
037.001 Perhaps, in his life, Franz had never experienced such a clear-cut impression, such a rapid passage from gaiety to sadness, as in this moment; it was as if Rome, under the magic breath of some demon of the night, had just changed into a vast tomb. By a chance which added still to the intensity of darkness, the moon, which was in its waning period, was not to rise until about eleven o'clock in the evening; the streets which the young man crossed were thus plunged in the deepest darkness. After ten minutes, his carriage, or rather that of the Count, stopped in front of the London Hotel.
037.002 Dinner was waiting; but as Albert had warned that he did not expect to return soon, Franz sat down to dinner without him.
037.003 Master Pastrini, who was accustomed to seeing them dine together, inquired about the reasons for his absence; but Franz contented himself with answering that Albert had received an invitation to which he had gone. The sudden extinction of the moccoletti, this darkness which had replaced the light, this silence which had succeeded the noise, had left in the spirit of Franz a certain sadness which was not exempt from concern. He therefore dined very quietly in spite of the unofficial solicitude of his host, who entered two or three times to inquire if he needed anything.
037.004 Franz was determined to wait for Albert as late as possible. He therefore asked for the carriage at eleven o'clock only, and asked Master Pastrini to let him know at once if Albert came back to the hotel for anything. At eleven o'clock, Albert had not returned. Franz got dressed and left, telling his host that he was spending the night at the Duke of Bracciano's.
037.005 The house of the duke of Bracciano is one of the most charming houses of Rome; his wife, one of the last heiresses of the Colonna, makes the honors of it in a perfect way: it results from it that the festivals which it gives have a European celebrity. Franz and Albert had arrived in Rome with letters of recommendation for him, so his first question was to ask Franz what had become of his traveling companion. Franz answered that he had left him just as the moccoli were about to be extinguished, and that he had lost sight of him in the Via Macello.
037.006 "Then he has not returned?" asked the duke.
037.007 --I waited for him until this hour, answered Franz.
037.008 --And do you know where he was going?
037.009 --No, not precisely; however, I think it was something like a rendezvous.
037.010 --Diable!" said the Duke, "it is a bad day, or rather a bad night to linger, isn't it, Madam Countess?"
037.011 These last words were addressed to the Countess G... who had just arrived, and who was walking on the arm of M. Torlonia, brother of the Duke.
037.012 "I find on the contrary that it is a charming night, answered the countess; and those which are here will complain of only one thing, it is that it will pass too quickly.
037.013 --And, the Duke smiled, I am not speaking of the people who are here, they run no other danger, the men than to become in love with you, the women to fall sick with jealousy at seeing you so beautiful; I am speaking of those who run the streets of Rome.
037.014 -- "Good God," asked the Countess, "who is running the streets of Rome at this hour, unless it is to go to the ball?
037.015 --Our friend Albert de Morcerf, madame la comtesse, whom I left in pursuit of his stranger about seven o'clock in the evening, said Franz, and whom I have not seen since.
037.016 --How! And you don't know where he is?
037.017 --Not in the least.
037.018 -- And does he have any weapons?
037.019 -- He's in the storeroom.
037.020 --You should not have let him go, said the Duke to Franz, you who know Rome better than he does.
037.021 --Oh, yes, it would have been better to try to arrest the number three of the barberi who won the race today, replied Franz; and besides, what do you want to happen to him?
037.022 --Who knows! The night is very dark, and the Tiber is very near the Via Macello."
037.023 Franz felt a thrill run through his veins as he saw the mind of the Duke and Countess so well attuned to his personal concerns.
037.024 "Also I warned at the hotel that I had the honor to spend the night with you, Mr. Duke," said Franz, "and they must come to announce his return.
037.025 --Here, says the duke, I believe that here is one of my servants who seeks you."
037.026 The duke was not mistaken; on seeing Franz, the servant approached him:
037.027 "Excellency," he said, "the master of the London hotel sends you word that a man is waiting for you at his house with a letter from the Viscount de Morcerf.
037.028 --With a letter from the viscount!" cried Franz.
037.029 --Yes.
037.030 --And who is this man?
037.031 --I do not know.
037.032 --Why didn't he come and bring it here?
037.033 -- The messenger gave me no explanation.
037.034 -- And where is the messenger?
037.035 -- He left as soon as he saw me enter the ballroom to warn you.
037.036 --Oh, my God! said the Countess to Franz, go quickly. Poor young man, perhaps some accident has befallen him.
037.037 --I am going, said Franz.
037.038 --Will we see each other again to give us news? asked the Countess.
037.039 --Yes, if the matter is not serious; if not, I cannot answer for what will become of me.
037.040 -- In any case, prudence, said the countess.
037.041 --Oh, be quiet."
037.042 Franz took his hat and left in a hurry. He had sent his carriage back with orders for two hours; but, fortunately, the Bracciano palace, which gave on one side to the Rue du Cours and on the other to the Place des Saints-Apôtres, was barely ten minutes' walk from the London hotel. As Franz approached the hotel, he saw a man standing in the middle of the street, and he did not doubt for a moment that it was Albert's messenger. This man was himself wrapped in a large coat. He went to him; but to Franz's great astonishment, it was this man who spoke to him first.
037.043 "What do you want with me, Excellency?" he said, taking a step backwards like a man who wishes to remain on guard.
037.044 -- Is it not you," asked Franz, "who bring me a letter from the Viscount de Morcerf?
037.045 --Is it your Excellency who is staying at the Pastrini hotel?
037.046 --Yes.
037.047 --Is Your Excellency the travel companion of the viscount?
037.048 --Yes.
037.049 --What is Your Excellency's name?
037.050 --Baron Franz d'Épinay.
037.051 --This letter is addressed to Your Excellency.
037.052 --Is there an answer?" asked Franz, taking the letter from his hand.
037.053 -- Yes, at least your friend hopes so.
037.054 -Go up to my house, then, I will give it to you.
037.055 --I'd rather wait for it here," said the messenger, laughing.
037.056 --Why is that?
037.057 --Your Excellency will understand the thing when he has read the letter.
037.058 --So I will meet you here?
037.059 --Surely."
037.060 Franz returned; on the stairs he met Master Pastrini.
037.061 "Well?" he asked him.
037.062 --Well what?" replied Franz.
037.063 --Did you see the man who wanted to speak to you on behalf of your friend?
037.064 --Yes, I saw him," replied the latter, "and he gave me this letter. Please have the light on at my house."
037.065 The innkeeper ordered a servant to precede Franz with a candle. The young man had found Master Pastrini to have a frightened air, and this air only made him more eager to read Albert's letter: he approached the candle as soon as it was lighted, and unfolded the paper. The letter was written in Albert's hand and signed by him. Franz read it twice, so far from expecting what it contained.
037.066 Here it is reproduced verbatim:
037.067 _"Dear friend, as soon as you receive this letter, please take from my wallet, which you will find in the square drawer of the secretary's desk, the letter of credit; enclose your own if it is not sufficient. Run to Torlonia's, take four thousand piastres from there at once and give it to the bearer. It is urgent that this sum be sent to me without any delay.
037.068 "_I do not insist further, counting on you as you might count on me.
037.069 "_P.S. I believe now to Italian banditti.
037.070 "_Your friend,_
037.071 "ALBERT DE MORCERF."
037.072 Below these lines were written in a foreign hand these few Italian words:
037.073 _"Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani, alle sette il comte Alberto avrà cessato di vivere._[1]
037.074 "LUIGI VAMPA."
037.075 [Note 1: If at six o'clock in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my hands, at seven o'clock Viscount Albert de Morcerf will have ceased to exist].
037.076 This second signature explained everything to Franz, who understood the messenger's reluctance to go up to his house; the street seemed safer than Franz's room. Albert had fallen into the hands of the famous chief of bandits in whose existence he had so long refused to believe.
037.077 There was no time to lose. He ran to the secretary, opened it, in the drawer indicated found the wallet, and in the wallet the letter of credit: it was in all six thousand piastres, but of these six thousand piastres Albert had already spent three thousand. As for Franz, he had no letter of credit; as he lived in Florence, and had come to Rome to spend only seven or eight days, he had taken a hundred louis, and of these a hundred louis he had at most fifty left.
037.078 Seven or eight hundred piastres were therefore needed for the two of them to raise the sum requested. It is true that Franz could count, in such a case, on the kindness of Messrs. Torlonia.
037.079 He was preparing to return to the Bracciano palace without wasting a moment, when suddenly a bright idea crossed his mind.
037.080 He thought of the Count of Monte Cristo. Franz was about to give the order for Master Pastrini to be sent for, when he saw him appear in person on his doorstep.
037.081 "My dear Mr. Pastrini," he said briskly, "do you think the Count is at home?
037.082 --Yes, Excellency, he has just returned.
037.083 -Did he have time to go to bed?
037.084 -- I doubt it.
037.085 --Then ring his doorbell, I pray you, and ask him for my permission to present myself at his house."
037.086 Master Pastrini hastened to follow the instructions he was given; five minutes later he was back.
037.087 "The Count is expecting Your Excellency," he said.
037.088 Franz crossed the square, a servant introduced him to the count. He was in a small cabinet which Franz had not yet seen, and which was surrounded by couches. The count came to meet him.
037.089 "Eh! what a good wind brings you at this hour," he said to him; "will you come and ask me to supper, by any chance? It would be very kind of you, by God.
037.090 -- No, I have come to talk to you about a serious matter.
037.091 --A matter!" said the Count, looking at Franz with that deep look which was his habit; "and what matter?
037.092 -Are we alone?"
037.093 The Count went to the door and returned.
037.094 "Perfectly alone," he said.
037.095 Franz presented him with Albert's letter.
037.096 "Read," he said.
037.097 The Count read the letter.
037.098 "Ah! ah!" he said.
037.099 --Did you read the postscript?
037.100 --Yes," he said, "I can see that:
037.101 "_Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani, alle sette il comte Alberto avrà cessato di vivere._
037.102 "LUIGI VAMPA."
037.103 "What do you say to that?" asked Franz.
037.104 --Do you have the amount of money they asked you for?
037.105 --Yes, minus eight hundred piastres."
037.106 The Count went to his secretary, opened it, and sliding out a drawer full of gold:
037.107 "I hope," he said to Franz, "that you will not do me the injustice of addressing anyone but me?
037.108 --On the contrary, you see that I have come straight to you," said Franz.
037.109 --And I thank you for it; take."
037.110 And he motioned to Franz to draw from the drawer.
037.111 "Is it really necessary to send this sum to Luigi Vampa?" asked the young man, staring back at the Count.
037.112 --Lady," he said, "judge for yourself, the postscript is precise.
037.113 --It seems to me that if you would take the trouble to look for it, you would find some way that would simplify the negotiation a great deal, said Franz.
037.114 --And which? asked the astonished Count.
037.115 --For example, if we went to Luigi Vampa together, I am sure that he would not refuse you Albert's freedom.
037.116 -- To me? And what influence do you want me to have on this bandit?
037.117 -- Didn't you just do him one of those services that are never forgotten?
037.118 -- And which one?
037.119 -- Did you not just save Peppino's life?
037.120 --Ah! ah! who told you that?
037.121 --What do you care? I know it."
037.122 The Count remained for a moment mute and frowning.
037.123 "And if I went to find Vampa, would you accompany me?
037.124 --If my company were not too unpleasant for you.
037.125 -- Well, so be it; the weather is fine, a walk in the countryside of Rome can only do us good.
037.126 --Do we have to take up arms?
037.127 --For what?
037.128 --Money?
037.129 --That's useless. Where is the man who brought this bill?
037.130 --On the street.
037.131 --He's waiting for the answer?
037.132 -- Yes.
037.133 -- We must know where we are going; I will call him.
037.134 --It's no use, he didn't want to come up.
037.135 --At home, perhaps; but, at my house, he will make no difficulties."
037.136 The Count went to the window of the cabinet which looked out on the street, and whistled in a certain way. The man in the cloak detached himself from the wall and advanced to the middle of the street.
037.137 "_Salute!"_ said the Count, in the tone in which he would have given an order to a servant.
037.138 The messenger obeyed without delay, without hesitation, with alacrity even, and, crossing the four steps of the stoop, entered the hotel. Five seconds later he was at the door of the cabinet.
037.139 "Ah, it's you, Peppino!" said the Count.
037.140 But Peppino, instead of answering, threw himself on his knees, seized the Count's hand and applied his lips to it several times.
037.141 "Ah! ah!" said the Count, "you have not yet forgotten that I saved your life! It's strange, though, that today was eight days ago.
037.142 -- No, Excellency, and I shall never forget it," answered Peppino with an accent of deep gratitude.
037.143 --Never, that's a long time! But it's already a lot that you believe it. Get up and answer."
037.144 Peppino cast a worried glance at Franz.
037.145 "Oh, you can speak before His Excellency," he said, "he is a friend of mine.
037.146 "You allow me to give you this title," said the Count in French, turning to Franz's side; "it is necessary to excite the confidence of this man.
037.147 --You may speak before me," said Franz, "I am a friend of the Count.
037.148 -- "Good day," said Peppino, turning in his turn to the Count; "let Your Excellency question me, and I will answer.
037.149 -How did Viscount Albert fall into Luigi's hands?
037.150 --Excellence, the Frenchman's carriage passed the one Teresa was in several times.
037.151 --The chief's mistress?
037.152 --Yes. The Frenchman made sweet eyes at her, Teresa amused herself by answering him; the Frenchman threw bouquets at her, she gave them back to him: all this, of course, with the consent of the chief, who was in the same carriage.
037.153 -How can it be that Luigi Vampa was in the carriage of the Roman peasants?
037.154 -It was he who was driving, disguised as a coachman, answered Peppino.
037.155 --Afterwards? asked the Count.
037.156 --Well, afterwards the Frenchman unmasked himself; Teresa, always with the consent of the chief, did the same; the Frenchman asked for an appointment, Teresa granted the appointment requested; only, instead of Teresa, it was Beppo who found himself on the steps of the church of San Giacomo.
037.157 -How could that peasant girl who took his moccoletto away from him," Franz interrupted again.
037.158 --It was a boy of fifteen," answered Peppino; "but there is no shame in your friend having been caught in it; Beppo has caught many others, come on.
037.159 --And Beppo led him outside the walls? said the Count.
037.160 --Actually, a carriage was waiting at the end of the Via Macello; Beppo got into it, inviting the Frenchman to follow him; he was not told twice. He gallantly offered Beppo the right hand, and placed himself near him. Beppo then announced to him that he was going to lead him to a villa located at one league from Rome. The Frenchman assured Beppo that he was ready to follow him to the end of the world. Immediately the coachman went up the Via di Ripetta, gained the San-Paolo gate; and at two hundred paces in the countryside, as the Frenchman became too enterprising, my faith, Beppo put a pair of pistols to his throat; immediately the coachman stopped his horses, turned on his seat and did the same. At the same time four of our people, who were hidden on the banks of the Almo, rushed to the doors. The Frenchman had a good desire to relax, he even strangled Beppo a little, I heard, but there was nothing to do against five armed men. He had to surrender; they got him out of the car, followed the banks of the little river, and led him to Teresa and Luigi, who were waiting for him in the catacombs of San Sebastian.
037.161 -- "Well," said the Count, turning to Franz, "it seems to me that this story is worth another. What do you say, you who are a connoisseur?
037.162 -- I say that I would find it very funny," replied Franz, "if it had happened to anyone but poor Albert.
037.163 -- The fact is, said the Count, that if you had not found me there, it was a good fortune which cost your friend a little; but, rest assured, he will be even for the fear.
037.164 --And we are still going to look for him? asked Franz.
037.165 -Goddamn it! Especially since it is in a very picturesque place. Do you know the catacombs of San Sebastian?
037.166 -- No, I have never been down there, but I promised myself I would go down there one day.
037.167 -- Well, here is the opportunity and it would be difficult to find a better one. Have you got your car?
037.168 -- No.
037.169 --That doesn't matter; I'm used to having one all hitched up, night and day.
037.170 --All hitched up?
037.171 --Yes, I am a very capricious person; I must tell you that sometimes when I get up, at the end of my dinner, in the middle of the night, I feel like leaving for some point in the world, and I leave.
037.172 The Count rang a bell, his valet appeared.
037.173 "Bring the carriage out of the shed," he said, "and take out the pistols that are in the pockets, there is no need to wake the coachman, Ali will drive."
037.174 After a moment the sound of the carriage stopping before the door was heard.
037.175 The Count pulled out his watch.
037.176 "Half past midnight," he said, "we could have left here at five o'clock in the morning and still have arrived in time; but perhaps this delay would have made your companion spend a bad night, so it is better to go straight to rescue him from the hands of the infidels. Are you still determined to accompany me?
037.177 --More than ever.
037.178 -- Well, come along then."
037.179 Franz and the Count went out, followed by Peppino.
037.180 At the door they found the carriage. Ali was on the seat. Franz recognized the mute slave from Monte Cristo's cave.
037.181 Franz and the Count got into the carriage, which was a coupe, Peppino took a seat next to Ali, and they set off at a gallop. Ali had received orders in advance, for he took the Via del Corso, crossed the Campo Vaccino, went up the Strada San Gregorio and arrived at the Porta San Sebastiano; there the concierge wanted to make some difficulty, but the Count of Monte Cristo presented an authorization from the governor of Rome to enter and leave the city at any hour of the day or night; the portcullis was therefore raised, the concierge received a louis for his trouble, and they passed.
037.182 The road which the carriage followed was the ancient Appian Way, lined with tombs. From time to time, in the light of the moon that was beginning to rise, Franz seemed to see a sentry standing out from a ruin, but immediately, at a sign exchanged between Peppino and this sentry, he returned to the shadows and disappeared.
037.183 A little before the circus of Caracalla, the carriage stopped, Peppino came to open the door, and the Count and Franz got out.
037.184 "In ten minutes," said the Count to his companion, "we will have arrived."
037.185 Then he took Peppino aside, gave him a quiet order, and Peppino left after providing himself with a torch which was taken from the trunk of the coupe.
037.186 Five more minutes passed, during which Franz saw the shepherd go down a small path through the movements of the ground that form the convulsed soil of the plain of Rome, and disappear in those high reddish grasses that seem the bristling mane of some gigantic lion.
037.187 "Now," said the Count, "let us follow him."
037.188 Franz and the Count took their turn in the same path, which, after a hundred paces, led them up a sloping hill to the bottom of a small valley.
037.189 Soon they saw two men talking in the shadows.
037.190 "Shall we go on?" asked Franz of the Count, "or shall we wait?
037.191 --Let's walk; Peppino must have warned the sentry of our arrival."
037.192 Indeed, one of these two men was Peppino, the other was a bandit placed in the spotlight.
037.193 Franz and the Count approached; the bandit saluted.
037.194 "Excellency," said Peppino, addressing the Count, "if you want to follow me, the opening of the catacombs is two steps from here.
037.195 -That's fine, said the Count, walk ahead."
037.196 Indeed, behind a clump of bushes and in the midst of some rocks there was an opening through which a man could hardly pass.
037.197 Peppino slipped through this crack first, but no sooner had he taken a few steps than the underground passage widened. Then he stopped, lit his torch and turned around to see if he was being followed.
037.198 The Count had gone first into a sort of window, and Franz was coming after him.
037.199 The ground sloped gently downward and widened as they went on; but still Franz and the Count were forced to walk bent over and could hardly have passed two abreast. They made another hundred and fifty steps like this, then they were stopped by the cry of: Who lives?
037.200 At the same time they saw the reflection of their own torch shining on the barrel of a rifle in the middle of the darkness.
037.201 "Friend!" said Peppino.
037.202 And he went forward alone and said a few words in a low voice to this second sentry, who, like the first, saluted, signaling to the nocturnal visitors that they could go on their way.
037.203 Behind the sentry was a staircase of about twenty steps; Franz and the Count descended the twenty steps, and found themselves in a sort of mortuary crossroads. Five roads diverged like the rays of a star, and the walls of the walls, cut with superimposed niches in the shape of coffins, indicated that they had finally entered the catacombs.
037.204 In one of these cavities, whose extent it was impossible to distinguish, one could see, during the day, some reflections of light.
037.205 The Count laid his hand on Franz's shoulder.
037.206 "Do you want to see a camp of bandits at rest?
037.207 --Certainly," Franz replied.
037.208 --Well, come with me.... Peppino, put out the torch."
037.209 Peppino obeyed, and Franz and the count found themselves in the deepest darkness; only, about fifty paces ahead of them, continued to dance along the walls some reddish gleams that had become even more visible since Peppino had extinguished his torch.
037.210 They advanced silently, the Count guiding Franz as if he had had this singular faculty of seeing in the darkness. Besides, Franz himself could see his way more easily as he approached the reflections which served as their guides.
037.211 Three arches, of which the middle one served as a door, gave them passage.
037.212 These arches opened on one side into the corridor where the Count and Franz were, and on the other into a large square room surrounded by niches similar to those we have already mentioned. In the middle of this room stood four stones that had once served as an altar, as indicated by the cross that still stood above them.
037.213 A single lamp, placed on a column shaft, illuminated with a pale and flickering light the strange scene that was presented to the eyes of the two visitors hidden in the shadows.
037.214 A man was sitting with his elbow resting on this column, reading with his back to the arches through which the newcomers were looking.
037.215 He was the leader of the gang, Luigi Vampa.
037.216 Around him, grouped according to their whim, lying in their coats or leaning against a kind of stone bench that reigned all around the columbarium, were about twenty brigands; each had his rifle at hand.
037.217 In the background, silent, barely visible and like a shadow, a sentry walked up and down in front of a kind of opening that could only be seen because the darkness seemed thicker in that place.
037.218 When the Count thought that Franz had sufficiently delighted his eyes with this picturesque picture, he raised his finger to his lips to recommend silence, and climbing the three steps that led from the corridor to the columbarium, he entered the room through the middle archway and advanced toward Vampa, who was so deeply immersed in his reading that he did not hear the sound of his footsteps.
037.219 "Who's alive?" cried the less preoccupied sentry, who saw in the light of the lamp a sort of shadow growing behind his leader.
037.220 At this cry Vampa rose quickly, pulling a pistol from his belt at the same time.
037.221 In an instant all the bandits were on their feet, and twenty rifle barrels were aimed at the Count.
037.222 "Well," said the Count quietly in a perfectly calm voice, without a single muscle in his face moving, "well, my dear Vampa, it seems to me that this is a great expense to receive a friend!
037.223 - "Arms down!" shouted the chief, making an imperative sign with one hand, while with the other he respectfully removed his hat.
037.224 Then turning to the singular figure who dominated the whole scene:
037.225 "Pardon, Monsieur le Comte," he said to him, "but I was so far from expecting the honor of your visit that I did not recognize you.
037.226 --It seems that you have a short memory in all things, Vampa, said the Count, and that not only do you forget the faces of people, but also the conditions made with them.
037.227 --And what conditions have I forgotten, sir count?" asked the bandit, like a man who, if he has made a mistake, would like nothing better than to repair it.
037.228 -- Was it not agreed, said the Count, that not only my person, but also that of my friends, would be sacred to you?
037.229 --And in what way have I failed to fulfill the treaty, Your Excellency?
037. 230 --This evening you kidnapped and brought here the viscount Albert de Morcerf; I am not sure that I have been able to do so, but I am sure that I have been able to do so, and I am sure that I have been able to do so, and I am sure that I have been able to do so, and I am sure that I have been able to do so, and I am sure that I have been able to do so, and I am sure that I have been able to do so, and I am sure that I have been able to do so, and I am sure that I have been able to do so, and I am sure that I have been able to do so, and I am sure that I have been able to do so, and I am sure that I have been able to do so, and I am sure that I have been able to do so, and I am sure that I have been able to do so.
037.231 -Why did you not warn me of this, you people? said the chief, turning to his men, who all shrank from his gaze; why did you expose me to breaking my word to a man like M. le Comte, who holds the lives of us all in his hands? By the blood of Christ! If I thought that any of you knew that the young man was His Excellency's friend, I would burn his brain with my own hand.
037.232 --Well," said the Count, turning back to Franz, "I told you there was some mistake there.
037.233 --Are you not alone? asked Vampa with concern.
037.234 -- I am with the person to whom this letter was addressed, and to whom I wanted to prove that Luigi Vampa is a man of his word. Come, Excellency," he said to Franz, "here is Luigi Vampa, who will tell you himself that he is desperate for the mistake he has just made."
037.235 Franz approached; the chief took a few steps in front of Franz.
037.236 "Welcome among us, Excellency," he said to him; "you have heard what the Count has just said, and what I have answered him: I will add that I would not like, for the four thousand piastres to which I had fixed the ransom of your friend, that such a thing had happened.
037.237 --But, said Franz, looking around anxiously, where is the prisoner?
037.238 -- Nothing has happened to him, I hope!" asked the Count, frowning.
037.239 --The prisoner is there," said Vampa, pointing with his hand to the recess in front of which the bandit on guard duty was walking, "and I will tell him myself that he is free."
037.240 The chief went forward to the place designated by him as Albert's prison, and Franz and the count followed him.
037.241 "What is the prisoner doing?" asked Vampa of the sentry.
037.242 "My goodness, Captain," replied the sentry, "I don't know; I haven't heard him stir for over an hour.
037.243 -- Come, Excellency," said Vampa.
037.244 The Count and Franz went up seven or eight steps, always preceded by the chief, who pulled a lock and pushed open a door.
037.245 Then, by the light of a lamp similar to the one that illuminated the columbarium, they could see Albert, wrapped in a cloak that one of the bandits had lent him, lying in a corner and sleeping the deepest sleep.
037.246 "Come on!" said the Count, smiling with that smile which was peculiar to him, "not bad for a man who was to be shot at seven in the morning."
037.247 Vampa looked at the sleeping Albert with some admiration; one could see that he was not insensitive to this proof of courage.
037.248 "You are right, sir count," he said, "this man must be a friend of yours."
037.249 Then approaching Albert and touching his shoulder:
037.250 "Excellency!" he said, "does it please you to wake up?"
037.251 Albert stretched out his arms, rubbed his eyelids and opened his eyes.
037.252 "Ah, ah," he said, "it's you, Captain! By God, you should have let me sleep; I was having a charming dream: I was dreaming that I was dancing the gallop at Torlonia's with the Countess G...!"
037.253 He drew his watch, which he had kept to judge for himself how much time had passed.
037.254 "Half past one in the morning!" he said, "but why on earth are you waking me up at this hour?
037.255 -To tell you that you are free, Excellency.
037.256 -My dear," said Albert with perfect freedom of mind, "remember well in the future this maxim of Napoleon the Great: "Only wake me up for bad news." If you had let me sleep, I would have finished my gallop, and I would have been grateful to you all my life.... So they paid my ransom?
037.257 -- No, Excellency.
037.258 --Well, then, how am I free?
037.259 -- Someone, to whom I have nothing to refuse, has come to claim you.
037.260 -- Up to here?
037.261 -- Up to here.
037.262 --Ah, by God, that someone is very kind!
037.263 Albert looked around and saw Franz.
037.264 "How," he said to him, "is it you, my dear Franz, who is pushing devotion to this point?
037.265 --No, not I," Franz answered, "but our neighbor, the Count of Monte Cristo.
037.266 --Ah, by Jove! Monsieur le Comte," said Albert cheerfully, adjusting his tie and cuffs, "you are a truly precious man, and I hope you will look upon me as your eternal obligee, first for the affair of the carriage, and then for this one!" and he held out his hand to the Count, who shuddered at the moment of giving him his own, but who nevertheless gave it to him.
037.267 The bandit looked at the whole scene with a stunned air; he was evidently accustomed to seeing his prisoners tremble before him, and here was one whose mocking mood had not been altered in the least: as for Franz, he was delighted that Albert had upheld, even in the face of a bandit, the national honor.
037.268 "My dear Albert," he said to him, "if you want to hurry, we will still have time to go and finish the night at Torlonia; you will take up your gallop where you left off, so that you will not hold any grudge against the lord Luigi, who has really behaved like a gallant man in this whole affair.
037.269 - "Oh, indeed," he said, "you are right, and we can be there at two o'clock. Sir Luigi," continued Albert, "is there any other formality to be fulfilled in order to take leave of Your Excellency?
037.270 -- None, sir," replied the bandit, "and you are free as a bird.
037.271 -- In that case, have a good and happy life; come, gentlemen, come!
037.272 And Albert, followed by Franz and the Count, descended the stairs and crossed the large square room; all the bandits were standing with their hats in their hands.
037.273 "Peppino," said the chief, "give me the torch.
037.274 --What are you doing?" asked the Count.
037.275 --I am driving you back, said the captain; that is the least honor I can do for Your Excellency."
037.276 And taking the lighted torch from the hands of the shepherd, he walked before his hosts, not like a valet performing a work of servility, but like a king preceding ambassadors.
037.277 When he reached the door, he bowed.
037.278 "And now, Sir Count," he said, "I renew my apologies, and I hope you do not hold any resentment against me for what has just happened?
037.279 --No, my dear Vampa," said the Count; "besides, you redeem your errors in such a gallant way that one is almost tempted to be grateful to you for having committed them.
037.280 --Messieurs!" said the chief, turning back to the young men, "perhaps the offer will not seem very attractive to you; but, if you should ever feel like paying me a second visit, wherever I am you will be welcome."
037.281 Franz and Albert saluted. The Count went out first, Albert next, Franz remained last.
037.282 "Your Excellency has something to ask me?" said Vampa, smiling.
037.283 --Yes, I admit it," replied Franz, "I would be curious to know what was the work you were reading so attentively when we arrived.
037.284 --The _Commentaries of Caesar_, said the bandit, that is my favorite book.
037.285 --Well, aren't you coming?
037.286 -So done, replied Franz, here I am!"
037.287 And he in turn came out of the window.
037.288 We took a few steps on the plain.
037.289 "Oh, pardon me," said Albert, turning back, "will you allow me, Captain?
037.290 And he lit his cigar at Vampa's torch.
037.291 "Now, sir count," he said, "the greatest possible diligence! I am very anxious to finish my night with the Duke of Bracciano."
037.292 The carriage was found where it had been left; the Count said a single Arabic word to Ali, and the horses set off at full speed.
037.293 It was just two o'clock by Albert's watch when the two friends returned to the dance hall.
037.294 Their return made an event; but, as they entered together, all the worries that had been conceived about Albert ceased at once.
037.295 "Madame," said the Viscount de Morcerf, advancing towards the Countess, "yesterday you were good enough to promise me a gallop; I come a little late to claim this gracious promise; but here is my friend, whose veracity you know, who will affirm to you that there is no fault of mine."
037.296 And as at this moment the music gave the signal for the waltz, Albert passed his arm around the Countess's waist and disappeared with her in the whirl of the dancers.
037.297 During this time Franz thought of the singular shivering which had passed through all the body of the count of Monte-Cristo at the moment when he had been somehow forced to give the hand to Albert.
038.000 The appointment.
038.001 The next day, when he got up, Albert's first word was to suggest to Franz that he pay a visit to the Count; he had already thanked him the day before, but he understood that a service like the one he had rendered him was worth two thanks.
038.002 Franz, who was drawn to the Count of Monte Cristo by an attraction mingled with terror, did not want to let him go alone to this man's house and accompanied him; they were both ushered into the salon: five minutes later, the Count appeared.
038.003 "Monsieur le Comte," said Albert, going to him, "allow me to repeat to you this morning what I said to you incorrectly yesterday: that I will never forget the circumstances in which you came to my aid, and that I will always remember that I owe you my life or thereabouts.
038.004 -My dear neighbor, answered the count laughing, you exaggerate your obligations towards me. You owe me a small saving of about twenty thousand francs on your travel budget and that is all; you see that it is not worth talking about it. On your side, he added, receive all my compliments, you have been adorable of shamelessness and carelessness.
038.005 --What do you want, Count, said Albert; I figured that I had had a bad quarrel and that a duel had followed, and I wanted to make these bandits understand one thing: that one fights in all the countries of the world, but that it is only the French who fight while laughing. Nevertheless, as my obligation to you is no less great, I have come to ask you if, through myself, my friends and my acquaintances, I could not be good for you. My father, the Count de Morcerf, who is of Spanish origin, has a high position in France and in Spain, and I have come to put myself and all the people who love me at your disposal.
038.006 -- Well, said the count, I confess to you, Monsieur de Morcerf, that I was waiting for your offer and that I accept it with a great heart. I had already cast my lot with you to ask you a great service.
038.007 -What is it?
038.008 --I've never been to Paris! I don't know Paris....
038.009 --Really!" exclaimed Albert, "you have lived until now without seeing Paris? it is incredible!
038.010 --That is so, however; but I feel as you do that a longer ignorance of the capital of the intelligent world is impossible. There is more: perhaps I would even have made this indispensable journey a long time ago, if I had known someone who could introduce me to this world where I had no relations.
038.011 --Oh! a man like you! exclaimed Albert.
038.012 --You are very good, but as I do not recognize myself as anything other than being able to compete as a millionaire with Mr. Aguado or Mr. Rothschild, and as I do not go to Paris to play the Stock Exchange, this little circumstance has held me back. Now your offer has decided me. Let's see, will you commit yourself, my dear Monsieur de Morcerf (the Count accompanied these words with a singular smile), will you commit yourself, when I go to France, to open the doors of this world to me, where I will be as much a stranger as a Huron or a Cochinchinese?
038.013 --Oh! as for that, sir count, wonderfully and wholeheartedly! answered Albert; and all the more gladly (my dear Franz, don't laugh at me too much!) as I am called back to Paris by a letter which I received this very morning and in which there is talk of an alliance with a very pleasant house which has the best relations in the Parisian world.
038.014 --Alliance by marriage? said Franz, laughing.
038.015 --Oh, my God, yes! Thus, when you come back to Paris you will find me a well-posed man and perhaps a family man. That will suit my natural gravity, won't it? In any case, Count, I repeat to you, I and my family are yours body and soul.
038.016 --I accept," said the Count, "for I swear to you that I lacked only this opportunity to realize projects that I have been brooding over for a long time."
038.017 Franz did not doubt for a moment that these projects were those of which the Count had let slip a word in the cave of Monte Cristo, and he looked at the Count while he said these words to try to catch on his physiognomy some revelation of these projects which were leading him to Paris; but it was very difficult to penetrate the soul of this man, especially when he veiled it with a smile.
038.018 "But, let us see, Count," resumed Albert, delighted to have to produce a man like Monte Cristo, "is this not one of those projects in the air, such as one makes a thousand of on a journey, and which, built on sand, are carried away at the first breath of wind?
038.019 --No, of honor, said the Count; I want to go to Paris, I must go.
038.020 --And when?
038.021 --But when will you be there yourself?
038.022 -Me, said Albert; oh, my God! in a fortnight or three weeks at the latest; time to come back.
038.023 -- Well, said the Count, I give you three months; you see that I am giving you a wide berth.
038.024 --And in three months, exclaimed Albert with joy, you will come knocking at my door?
038.025 -- Do you want an appointment day for day, hour for hour? said the Count, I warn you that I am hopelessly exact.
038.026 --Day for day, hour for hour, said Albert; that suits me perfectly.
038.027 -- Well, so be it. He stretched out his hand towards a calendar hanging near the mirror. It is today, he said, the 21st of February (he drew his watch); it is half past ten in the morning. Will you wait for me next May 21, at half past ten in the morning?
038.028 -- Wonderful!" said Albert, "lunch will be ready.
038.029 --You live?
038.030 -- Helder Street, No. 27.
038.031 --You are at home as a boy, I won't disturb you?
038.032 --I live in my father's hotel, but a pavilion at the end of the courtyard entirely separate.
038.033 --Good."
038.034 The Count took up his tablets and wrote: "Rue du Helder, No. 27, May 21, at half past ten in the morning."
038.035 "And now," said the Count, putting his tablets back into his pocket, "be at ease, the hand of your clock will not be more exact than I am.
038.036 --Will I see you again before I leave?" asked Albert.
038.037 --That depends: when are you leaving?
038.038 -- I leave tomorrow, at five o'clock in the evening.
038.039 -- In that case, I bid you farewell. I have business in Naples and will not be back here until Saturday evening or Sunday morning. And you," asked the Count to Franz, "are you also leaving, Baron?
038.040 -- Yes.
038.041 --For France?
038.042 -- No, to Venice. I am staying another year or two in Italy.
038.043 --So we will not see each other in Paris?
038.044 -- I am afraid I will not have that honor.
038.045 --All right, gentlemen, have a good trip," said the Count to the two friends, holding out a hand to each of them.
038.046 It was the first time Franz had touched the man's hand; he shuddered, for it was as cold as a dead man's.
038.047 "One last time," said Albert, "it's well established, on my word of honor, isn't it?" "Helder Street, number 27, May 21, at half past ten in the morning?
038.048 - "On May 21, at half past ten in the morning, in the Rue du Helder, No. 27," said the Count.
038.049 Whereupon the two young men saluted the Count and went out.
038.050 "What's the matter with you?" said Albert to Franz as he went home, "you look very worried.
038.051 --Yes," said Franz, "I admit to you that the Count is a singular man, and I see with concern this appointment he has given you in Paris.
038.052 --This appointment... with concern! Ah, but are you mad, my dear Franz?" cried Albert.
038.053 -- What do you want, said Franz, crazy or not, that's how it is.
038.054 --Listen," said Albert, "and I am glad to have the opportunity of telling you this, but I have always found you rather cold to the Count, whom I have always found perfect, on the contrary, to us. Do you have anything particular against him?
038.055 --Maybe.
038.056 -Had you seen him somewhere before you met him here?
038.057 -- Just so.
038.058 --Where?
038.059 -Do you promise not to say a word about what I am about to tell you?
038.060 -- I promise.
038.061 --Speech of honor?
038.062 --Sword of honor.
038.063 --That's good. Listen to this.
038.064 And then Franz told Albert about his excursion to the island of Monte Cristo, how he had found a crew of smugglers there, and in the middle of this crew two Corsican bandits. He dwelt on all the circumstances of the fairy-tale hospitality which the Count had given him in his cave in the Thousand and One Nights; he told him about the supper, the hashish, the statues, the reality and the dream, and how when he woke up, all that remained as proof and as a memory of all these events was that little yacht, sailing for Porto-Vecchio on the horizon.
038.065 Then he went on to Rome, to the night of the Colosseum, to the conversation he had overheard between himself and Vampa, a conversation relating to Peppino, and in which the Count had promised to obtain the bandit's pardon, a promise he had kept so well, as our readers have been able to judge.
038.066 Finally, he came to the adventure of the previous night, to the embarrassment in which he had found himself when he saw that he was short six or seven hundred piastres to complete the sum; finally, to the idea he had had of approaching the Count, an idea which had had such a picturesque and satisfying result at once.
038.067 Albert listened to Franz with all his ears.
038.068 "Well," he said to him when he had finished, "where do you see in all this anything to take back? The Count is a traveler, the Count has a ship of his own, because he is rich. Go to Portsmouth or Southampton, and you will see the harbors crowded with yachts belonging to rich Englishmen who have the same fancy. In order to know where to stop in his excursions, to avoid eating that awful cuisine which has poisoned us, me for four months, you for four years, to avoid sleeping in those abominable beds where one cannot sleep, he has a pied-à-terre furnished at Monte Cristo: when his pied-à-terre is furnished, he fears that the Tuscan government will give him leave and that his expenses will be lost, so he buys the island and takes the name. My dear, search your memory, and tell me how many people of your acquaintance take the name of properties they never had.
038.069 --But, said Franz to Albert, the Corsican bandits in his crew?
038.070 --Well, what's the wonder of that? You know better than anyone, don't you, that the Corsican bandits are not thieves, but purely and simply fugitives whom some vendetta has exiled from their town or village; one can therefore see them without compromising oneself: as for me, I declare that if I ever go to Corsica, before I am presented to the governor and the prefect, I will be presented to the bandits of Colomba, if however one can get hold of them; I find them charming.
038.071 --But Vampa and his troop, Franz continued; those are bandits who arrest to steal; you do not deny it, I hope. What do you say about the Count's influence on such men?
038.072 -- I will say, my dear, that, as in all probability I owe my life to this influence, it is not for me to criticize it too closely. Thus, instead of making him, as you do, a capital crime, you will find it good that I excuse him, if not for having saved my life, which is perhaps a little exaggerated, but at least for having spared me four thousand piastres, which makes well and truly twenty-four thousand pounds of our currency, a sum at which I would certainly not have been estimated in France; which proves, added Albert laughing, that no one is a prophet in his own country.
038.073 --Well, that's just it; what country is the Count from? what language does he speak? what are his means of existence? where does his immense fortune come from? what was that first part of his mysterious and unknown life which has spread over the second this dark and misanthropic tint? That, in your place, is what I would like to know.
038.074 -My dear Franz," resumed Albert, "when you received my letter and saw that we needed the Count's influence, you went to tell him: 'Albert de Morcerf, my friend, is in danger; help me to get him out of this danger!
038.075 --Yes.
038.076 --So, did he ask you: "What is M. Albert de Morcerf? where does his name come from? where does his fortune come from? what is his livelihood? where was he born?" Did he ask you all this, say?
038.077 -- No, I admit it.
038.078 -- He came, that's all. He got me out of Mr. Vampa's hands; where, in spite of my casual appearances, as you say, I looked very bad, I confess. Well, my dear, when in exchange for such a service he asks me to do for him what is done every day for the first Russian or Italian prince who passes through Paris, that is to say, to introduce him to the world, you want me to refuse him that! Come on, you're crazy."
038.079 It must be said that, against the habit, all the good reasons were this time on Albert's side.
038.080 "Finally," Franz resumed with a sigh, "do as you please, my dear viscount; for all that you are telling me here is very specious, I confess; but it is no less true that the Count of Monte Cristo is a strange man.
038.081 -The Count of Monte Cristo is a philanthropist. He did not tell you for what purpose he came to Paris. Well, he is coming to compete for the Montyon prizes; and if all he needs is my vote to get them, and the influence of this ugly gentleman to get them, well, I will give him the one and guarantee him the other. On that note, my dear Franz, let's not talk about it any more, let's sit down at the table and go make a last visit to St. Peter's."
038.082 It was done as Albert said, and the next day, at five o'clock in the afternoon, the two young men left each other, Albert de Morcerf to return to Paris, Franz d'Épinay to go and spend a fortnight in Venice.
038.083 But before getting into the carriage, Albert gave the waiter a card for the Count of Monte Cristo, on which he had written in pencil under the words: "Vicomte Albert de Morcerf", so fearful was he that his guest would miss the appointment:
038.084 _21 May, at half past ten in the morning, 27, rue du Helder._
039.000 The guests.
039.001 In this house in the Rue du Helder, where Albert de Morcerf had given an appointment in Rome to the Count of Monte Cristo, everything was being prepared on the morning of May 21 to honor the word of the young man.
039.002 Albert de Morcerf lived in a pavilion situated at the corner of a large courtyard and facing another building destined for the commons. Only two of the windows of this pavilion faced the street, the others were open, three on the courtyard and two others in return on the garden.
039.003 Between this court and this garden rose, built with the bad taste of the imperial architecture, the fashionable and vast dwelling of the count and the countess of Morcerf.
039.004 On all the width of the property reigned, giving on the street, a wall surmounted, from distance to distance, of vases of flowers, and cut in the medium by a large gate with gilded lances, which was used for the entries of apparat; a small door almost joined to the lodge of the concierge gave passage to the people of service or to the masters entering or leaving on foot.
039.005 One guessed, in this choice of the pavilion intended for the dwelling of Albert, the delicate foresight of a mother who, not wanting to separate herself from her son, had however understood that a young man of the age of the viscount needed his whole freedom. One recognized there also, on the other hand, we must say it, the intelligent selfishness of the young man, in love with this free and idle life, which is that of the sons of family, and that one gilded to him like to the bird its cage.
039.006 Through the two windows overlooking the street, Albert de Morcerf could explore the outside. The view of the outside is so necessary to the young people who always want to see the world crossing their horizon, this horizon being only that of the street! Then, once his exploration was done, if it seemed to merit a more thorough examination, Albert de Morcerf could, in order to devote himself to his researches, leave by a small door which was the counterpart of the one we have indicated near the porter's lodge, and which deserves a particular mention.
039.007 It was a small door that seemed to have been forgotten by everyone since the day the house was built, and that one would have thought condemned forever, so discreet and powdery did it seem, but whose lock and hinges, carefully oiled, announced a mysterious and regular practice. This little sly door competed with the other two and mocked the concierge, from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it escaped, opening like the famous door of the cave of the _A Thousand and One Nights_, like the enchanted Sesame of Ali-Baba, by means of a few cabalistic words, or a few agreed-upon scratches, pronounced by the softest voices or operated by the most slender fingers in the world.
039.008 At the end of a vast and calm corridor, to which this small door communicated and which made an anteroom, opened, on the right, the dining room of Albert giving on the court, and, on the left, his small living room giving on the garden. Massifs, climbing plants widening in fan in front of the windows, hid from the court and the garden the interior of these two rooms, the only ones placed at the first floor as they were, where could penetrate the indiscreet glances.
039.009 With the first, these two rooms were repeated, enriched of a third, taken on the anteroom. These three rooms were a living room, a bedroom and a boudoir.
039.010 The living room below was only a kind of Algerian couch intended for the smokers.
039.011 The boudoir of the first gave in the bedroom, and, by an invisible door, communicated with the staircase. One sees that all the measures of precaution were taken.
039.012 Above this second floor reigned a vast workshop, which one had enlarged by throwing low walls and partitions, pandemonium that the artist disputed with the dandy. There took refuge and piled up all the successive whims of Albert, the hunting horns, the basses, the flutes, a complete orchestra, because Albert had had for a moment, not the taste, but the fantasy of music; the easels, the palettes, the pastels, because to the fantasy of music had succeeded the fatuity of painting; finally the foils, the gloves of boxing, the espadons and the canes of any kind; for finally, according to the traditions of the fashionable young people of the time in which we arrived, Albert de Morcerf cultivated, with infinitely more perseverance than he had done with music and painting, these three arts which complete the Leonine education, that is to say, fencing, boxing and the baton, and he received successively in this room, intended for all the exercises of the body, Grisier, Cooks and Charles Leboucher.
039. 013 The remainder of the pieces of furniture of this privileged room were old sideboards of the time of François Ier, sideboards full of porcelain of China, vases of Japan, earthenware of Luca della Robbia and dishes of Bernard de Palissy; antique armchairs where Henri IV or Sully, Louis XIII or Richelieu may have sat, for two of these armchairs, adorned with a carved shield where the three fleurs-de-lis of France shone on the azure, surmounted by a royal crown, were visibly coming out of the Louvre's furniture repositories, or at least out of the one of some royal castle. On these armchairs with dark and severe backgrounds, were thrown jumbled rich fabrics with bright colors, dyed in the sun of Persia or hatched under the fingers of the women of Calcutta or Chandernagor. What these fabrics were doing there, one could not have said; they waited, by recreating the eyes, a destination unknown to their owner himself, and, while waiting, they illuminated the apartment of their silky and gilded reflections.
039.014 In the most conspicuous place stood a piano, carved by Roller and Blanchet from rosewood, a piano the size of our Lilliputian salons, enclosing however an orchestra in its narrow and sonorous cavity, and groaning under the weight of the masterpieces of Beethoven, Weber, Mozart, Haydn, Grétry and Porpora.
039.015 Then, everywhere, along the walls, above the doors, on the ceiling, swords, daggers, criks, maces, axes, complete gilded, damascened, inlaid armors; herbariums, blocks of minerals, birds stuffed with horsehair, opening for a motionless flight their wings color of fire and their beak which they never close.
039.016 It goes without saying that this room was Albert's favorite.
039.017 However, the day of the appointment, the young man, in half a cloth, had established his headquarters in the small lounge of the first floor. There, on a table surrounded at a distance by a wide and soft divan, all the known tobaccos, from the yellow tobacco of Petersburg, to the black tobacco of Sinai, passing by the maryland, the porto-rico and the latakiéh, resplendent in the cracked earthenware pots which the Dutch adore. Next to them, in boxes of fragrant wood, were arranged, in order of size and quality, puros, regalias, havans and manilla; finally, in a wide-open cupboard, a collection of German pipes, of amber-encrusted shibboleths adorned with coral, and of gold-encrusted hookahs, with long morocco pipes rolled like snakes, awaited the whim or sympathy of smokers. Albert himself had presided over the arrangement, or rather the symmetrical disorder that after coffee, the guests of a modern lunch like to contemplate through the steam that escapes from their mouths and rises to the ceiling in long and capricious spirals.
039.018 At a quarter to ten, a valet entered. He was a little bellboy of fifteen, speaking only English and answering to the name of John, Morcerf's entire servant. Of course, on ordinary days the hotel cook was at his disposal, and on special occasions the count's hunter was also.
039.019 This valet, whose name was Germain and who enjoyed the complete confidence of his young master, held in his hand a bundle of newspapers which he placed on a table, and a packet of letters which he handed to Albert.
039.020 Albert glanced distractedly at these various missives, chose two with fine handwriting and perfumed envelopes, unsealed them and read them with some attention.
039.021 "How did these letters come?" he asked.
039.022 --One came by mail, the other was brought by Mrs. Danglars' valet.
039.023 --Tell Madame Danglars that I accept the place she offers me in her dressing room.... Wait then... then, during the day, you will go to Rosa's; you will tell her that I will go, as she invites me to do, to dine with her when I leave the Opera, and you will bring her six bottles of assorted wines, of Cyprus, of Sherry, of Malaga, and a barrel of oysters from Ostend.... Take the oysters to Borel's, and say above all that they are for me.
039.024 --What time does the gentleman want to be served?
039.025 --What time is it?
039.026 -- Quarter to ten.
039.027 --Well, serve at half past ten sharp. Debray will perhaps be forced to go to his ministry.... And besides... (Albert consulted his tablets), it is indeed the hour that I indicated to the count, on May 21, at half past ten in the morning, and although I do not make much of his promise, I want to be exact. By the way, do you know if the Countess is up?
039.028 --If monsieur le viscount wishes it, I will find out.
039.029 --Yes... you will ask her for one of her liquor cellars, mine is incomplete, and you will tell her that I will have the honor of passing by her house about three o'clock, and that I am asking her permission to introduce someone to her."
039.030 The valet left, Albert threw himself on the couch, tore the envelope of two or three newspapers, looked at the shows, grimaced when he recognized that an opera and not a ballet was being played, searched in vain in the perfumery advertisements for an opiate for the teeth of which he had been told, and rejected one after the other the three most popular sheets in Paris, muttering in the midst of an extended yawn:
039.031 "In truth, these papers are becoming more and more dull."
039.032 At this moment a light carriage stopped in front of the door, and a moment later the valet returned to announce M. Lucien Debray. A tall, pale, blond young man, with a gray, confident eye, thin, cold lips, a blue suit with chiseled gold buttons, a white tie, a tortoiseshell lorgnon suspended by a silk thread, and which, by an effort of the brow and zygomatic nerves, he managed to fix from time to time in the cavity of his right eye, entered without smiling, without speaking, and with a semi-official air.
039.033 "Hello, Lucien.... Good morning!" said Albert. Ah! you frighten me, my dear, with your exactitude! What do I say? accuracy! You whom I expected only the last, you arrive at five minutes to ten, when the final appointment is only at half past ten! It is miraculous! Is the ministry overthrown, by any chance?
039.034 -- "No, dear," said the young man, sinking into the couch; "don't worry, we always stumble, but we never fall, and I'm beginning to think that we're simply going to be irremovable, not to mention that the affairs of the Peninsula are going to consolidate us completely.
039.035 --Ah, yes, it is true, you are driving Don Carlos out of Spain.
039.036 -- No, not, my dear, let us not confuse the matter, we are bringing him back across the border of France, and we are offering him a royal hospitality in Bourges.
039.037 --At Bourges?
039.038 -- Yes, he can't complain, what the hell! Bourges is the capital of King Charles VII. How could you not know that? It has been known since yesterday to all Paris, and the day before yesterday the thing had already transpired on the Stock Exchange, for M. Danglars (I don't know by what means this man knows the news at the same time as we do), for M. Danglars has played up and won a million.
039.039 --And you, a new ribbon, it seems; for I see a blue border added to your skewer?
039.040 --Huh! they sent me the plate of Charles III, Debray replied carelessly.
039.041 --Come on, don't be indifferent, and admit that you were pleased to receive it.
039.042 --Ma foi, oui, comme complément de toilette, une plaque fait bien sur un habit noir boutonné, c'est élégant.
039.043 --And," said Morcerf, smiling, "you look like the Prince of Wales or the Duke of Reichstadt.
039.044 --That is why you see me so early in the morning, my dear.
039.045 --Because you have the plate of Charles III and you wanted to tell me this good news?
039.046 -- No; because I spent the night sending letters: twenty-five diplomatic dispatches. When I got home this morning at daylight, I wanted to sleep; but the headache took hold of me, and I got up to ride for an hour. In Boulogne, boredom and hunger seized me, two enemies that rarely go together, and that nevertheless have joined forces against me: a kind of Carlos-Republican alliance; I then remembered that they were feasting at your place this morning, and here I am: I am hungry, feed me; I am bored, amuse me.
039.047 --It is my duty as an amphitryon, dear friend," said Albert, ringing the valet, while Lucien blew up the unfolded newspapers with the end of his gold-headed, turquoise-encrusted badine. "Germain, a glass of sherry and a cookie. In the meantime, my dear Lucien, here are some contraband cigars, of course; I urge you to taste them and to invite your minister to sell us some of the same, instead of those species of walnut leaves that he condemns good citizens to smoke.
039.048 -Peaceful! I would beware of that. From the moment they come to you from the government you would not want them anymore and would find them execrable. Besides, this does not concern the interior, it concerns the finances: address yourself to Mr. Humann, section of indirect taxes, corridor A, n° 26.
039.049 -- In truth, said Albert, you astonish me by the extent of your knowledge. But have a cigar!
039.050 --Ah! dear viscount, said Lucien, lighting a manila from a pink candle burning in a vermeil candlestick and falling back on the couch, ah! dear viscount, how happy you are to have nothing to do! In truth, you do not know your happiness!
039.051 --And what would you do, my dear peacemaker of kingdoms," said Morcerf with a slight irony, "if you did nothing? How! private secretary of a minister, thrown at once into the great European cabal and the little intrigues of Paris; having kings, and, better than that, queens to protect, parties to unite, elections to direct; making more of your cabinet with your pen and your telegraph, than Napoleon did of his battlefields with his sword and his victories; possessing twenty-five thousand pounds of income outside your place; a horse of which Château-Renaud offered you four hundred louis, and which you did not want to give; a tailor who never misses a pair of pants; having the Opera, the Jockey-Club and the Variety Theatre, you do not find in all this something to amuse yourself? Well, then, I will entertain you.
039.052 -- How?
039.053 -- By making you a new acquaintance.
039.054 -- As a man or a woman?
039.055 -- As a man.
039.056 -- Oh, I know a lot of them already!
039.057 --But you don't know any like the one I'm talking about.
039.058 -Where does he come from?
039.059 --From further away, perhaps.
039.060 --Ah hell! I hope he doesn't bring our lunch?
039.061 -- No, don't worry, our lunch is made in the mother's kitchen. But are you hungry?
039.062 --Yes, I admit it, as humiliating as it is to say. But I dined yesterday at M. de Villefort's; and did you notice that, dear friend?
039.063 --Ah, by God, depreciate the dinners of others, with that one dines well at your ministers.
039.064 --Yes, but we don't invite the right people, at least; and if we weren't obliged to do the honors of our table to a few crunchy people who think and above all vote well, we would be careful not to dine with us, I beg you to believe.
039.065 --So, my dear, have a second glass of sherry and another cookie.
039.066 --Your Spanish wine is excellent; you can see that we were quite right to pacify that country.
039.067 -- Yes, but Don Carlos?
039.068 -- Well, Don Carlos will drink Bordeaux wine and in ten years we will marry his son to the little queen.
039.069 --That will earn you the Golden Fleece, if you are still at the ministry.
039.070 --I believe, Albert, that this morning you adopted the system of feeding me smoke.
039.071 -- Oh, that's still the best way to amuse the stomach, I agree; but, look, I can just hear Beauchamp's voice in the anteroom, you'll argue, that will make you more patient.
039.072 -- About what?
039.073 -- About newspapers.
039.074 --Oh, my dear friend," said Lucien with sovereign contempt, "do I read the papers!
039.075 --Another reason, then you will argue much more.
039.076 --M. Beauchamp!" announced the valet.
039.077 --Enter, enter! terrible feather! said Albert, rising and going to meet the young man. Here is Debray, who hates you without reading you, as far as he can tell.
039.078 -- He is quite right, said Beauchamp, it is like me, I criticize him without knowing what he does. Good morning, Commander.
039.079 --Ah! you already know that, replied the private secretary, exchanging a handshake and a smile with the journalist.
039.080 --Goodbye!" said Beauchamp.
039.081 --And what do they say about it in the world?
039.082 --In what world? We have many worlds in the year of grace 1838.
039.083 --Eh! in the critical-political world, of which you are one of the lions.
039.084 --But it is said that it is a very just thing, and that you sow enough red so that it grows a little blue.
039.085 --All right, all right, not bad, said Lucien: why are you not one of us, my dear Beauchamp? Having a mind like yours, you would make a fortune in three or four years.
039.086 - I am only waiting for one thing to follow your advice: a ministry that is assured for six months. Now, just one word, my dear Albert, for I must let poor Lucien breathe. Shall we have lunch or dinner? I have the House. Everything is not rosy, as you see, in our profession.
039.087 -- We'll only have lunch; we're only waiting for two more people, and we'll sit down to dinner as soon as they arrive.
039.088 --And what sort of people are you expecting at lunch?
039.089 --A gentleman and a diplomat, said Albert.
039.090 --Then it is a matter of two short hours for the gentleman and two long hours for the diplomat. I will return at the dessert. Save me some strawberries, coffee and cigars. I'll eat a cutlet in the House.
039.091 -- Don't worry about it, Beauchamp, for even if the gentleman were a Montmorency, and the diplomat a Metternich, we shall have lunch at ten-thirty sharp; in the meantime do as Debray does, taste my sherry and cookies.
039.092 - Well, I'll stay. I absolutely must distract myself this morning.
039.093 --Well, you're just like Debray! It seems to me, however, that when the ministry is sad, the opposition must be cheerful.
039.094 --Ah, you see, dear friend, you don't know what's threatening me. This morning I shall hear a speech by M. Danglars in the Chamber of Deputies, and this evening, at his wife's house, a tragedy by a peer of France. The devil take the constitutional government! And since we had a choice, they say, how did we choose this one?
039.095 -- I understand; you need to stock up on hilarity.
039.096 --Don't say anything bad about Mr. Danglars' speeches, said Debray: he votes for you, he is in opposition.
039.097 --That, by God, is the harm! So I wait until you send him to Luxembourg to make a joke of him at my leisure.
039.098 -Mon cher, said Albert to Beauchamp, one sees well that the affairs of Spain are arranged, you are this morning of a revolting sourness. Remember, then, that the Parisian chronicle speaks of a marriage between me and Miss Eugenie Danglars. I cannot, therefore, in conscience, let you speak ill of the eloquence of a man who must say to me one day: "Monsieur le vicomte, you know that I am giving two millions to my daughter."
039.099 --All right then! said Beauchamp, this marriage will never be made. The king may have made him a baron, he may make him a peer, but he will not make him a gentleman, and the Count de Morcerf is too aristocratic a sword to consent, in return for two poor millions, to a misalliance. The viscount of Morcerf must marry only a marquise.
039.100 -Two millions! it is however pretty!
039.101 --That is the capital stock of a boulevard theater or of a railroad from the Jardin des Plantes to the Râpée.
039.102 --Let him say it, Morcerf," Debray continued nonchalantly, "and get married. You marry the label of a bag, don't you? Well, what does it matter to you! better then to have one less coat of arms and one more zero on this label; you have seven merlettes in your arms, you will give three to your wife and you will still have four left. That is one more than M. de Guise, who almost became king of France, and whose first cousin was emperor of Germany.
039.103 --My goodness, I think you are right, Lucien," replied Albert distractedly.
039.104 --And certainly! Besides, every millionaire is as noble as a bastard, that is, he can be.
039.105 --Hush! Don't say that, Debray," Beauchamp laughed, "for here is Château-Renaud who, to cure you of your mania for paradox, will pass through your body the sword of Renaud de Montauban, his ancestor.
039.106 -- He would then derogate, replied Lucien, for I am naughty and very naughty.
039.107 --Good!" exclaimed Beauchamp, "here is the ministry singing Béranger, where are we going, my God?
039.108 --Mr. de Château-Renaud! Mr. Maximilien Morrel!" said the valet de chambre, announcing two new guests.
039.109 --Complete then!" said Beauchamp, "and we are going to have lunch; for, if I am not mistaken, you were expecting only two more people, Albert?
039.110 --Morrel!" murmured a surprised Albert; "Morrel! what is this?
039.111 But before he had finished, M. de Château-Renaud, a handsome young man of thirty, a gentleman from head to foot, that is to say, with the face of a Guiche and the spirit of a Mortemart, had taken Albert by the hand:
039.112 "Permit me, my dear," he said to him, "to present to you M. Captain of Spahis Maximilien Morrel, my friend, and moreover my savior. Besides, the man presents himself well enough. Greet my hero, viscount."
039.113 And he ranged himself to unmask that tall, noble young man with the broad forehead, the piercing eye, and the black whiskers, whom our readers remember having seen at Marseilles, in a circumstance dramatic enough that they have not yet forgotten him. A rich uniform, half-French, half-Oriental, admirably worn, emphasized his broad chest decorated with the cross of the Legion of Honor, and brought out the bold arch of his waist. The young officer bowed with a polite elegance; Morrel was graceful in every movement, because he was strong.
039.114 "Sir," said Albert with affectionate courtesy, "M. le Baron de Château-Renaud knew in advance all the pleasure he was giving me by making your acquaintance; you are one of his friends, sir, be one of us.
039.115 --Very well, said Château-Renaud, and I hope, my dear viscount, that if need be he will do for you what he has done for me.
039.116 --And what did he do? asked Albert.
039.117 --Oh! said Morrel, it is not worth talking about, and monsieur exaggerates.
039.118 --How! said Château-Renaud, it is not worth talking about! Life is not worth talking about! In truth, it is too philosophical what you say there, my dear Mr. Morrel.... Good for you who expose your life every day, but for me who expose it once by chance....
039.119 --The clearest thing I can see in all this, Baron, is that Captain Morrel saved your life.
039.120 --Oh, my God, yes, quite simply," said Château-Renaud.
039.121 --And on what occasion?
039.122 --Beauchamp, my friend, you will know that I am dying of hunger, said Debray, so don't make a fuss.
039.123 --Well, but, said Beauchamp, I don't prevent us from sitting down to table, I.... Château-Renaud will tell us about it at the table.
039.124 --Messieurs, said Morcerf, it is still only a quarter past ten, note well that, and we await a last guest.
039.125 --Ah, that's right, a diplomat," said Debray.
039.126 --A diplomat, or something else, I don't know; what I do know is that on my account I charged him with an embassy which he completed so well to my satisfaction, that if I had been king, I would have made him at once a knight of all my orders, had I had the disposition of both the Golden Fleece and the Garter.
039.127 -Since we have not yet sat down to eat, said Debray, pour yourself a glass of sherry as we have done, and tell us about it, baron.
039.128 --You all know that I had the idea of going to Africa.
039.129 --That is a path that your ancestors have traced for you, my dear Château-Renaud, replied Morcerf gallantly.
039.130 -- Yes, but I doubt that it was, like them, to deliver the tomb of Christ.
039.131 --And you are right, Beauchamp, said the young aristocrat; it was simply to make an amateur of the pistol shot. The duel is repugnant to me, as you know, since two witnesses, whom I had chosen to accommodate a case, forced me to break the arm of one of my best friends... pardon me! of poor Franz d'Epinay, whom you all know.
039.132 - "Oh yes, it's true," said Debray, "you did fight in the old days... About what?
039.133 -The devil take me if I remember!" said Château-Renaud; "but what I remember perfectly is that, ashamed to let a talent like mine lie dormant, I wanted to try out on the Arabs some new pistols which had just been given to me. Consequently I embarked for Oran; from Oran I reached Constantine, and I arrived just to see the siege lifted. I retired like the others. During forty-eight hours I endured quite well the rain during the day, the snow at night; finally, in the third morning, my horse died of cold. Poor animal! accustomed to the blankets and the stove of the stable... an Arabian horse which only found itself a little out of place by encountering ten degrees of cold in Arabia.
039.134 --That is why you want to buy me my English horse, said Debray; you suppose that it will bear the cold better than your Arab.
039.135 --You are mistaken, for I have vowed not to return to Africa.
039.136 --So you were afraid? asked Beauchamp.
039.137 --My faith, yes, I admit it, replied Château-Renaud; and there was reason for it! I had to go to the village to see the people, and I had to go to the village to see the people, and I had to go to the village to see the people, and I had to go to the village to see the people. One took me by the hair, that's why I wear it short now, you don't know what can happen, the other wrapped his yatagan around my neck, and I could already feel the sharp chill of the iron, when monsieur, whom you see, charged at them in turn, killed the one who was holding me by the hair with a pistol shot, and split the head of the one who was about to cut my throat with a saber. Sir had given himself the task of saving a man that day, chance wanted it to be me; when I am rich, I will have Klagmann or Marochetti make a statue of Chance.
039.138 --Yes, said Morrel smiling, it was the 5th of September, that is to say the anniversary of a day when my father was miraculously saved; also, as much as it is in my power, I celebrate every year this day by some action....
039.139 -- Heroic, isn't it?" interrupted Château-Renaud; "in short, I was the chosen one, but that's not all. After having saved me from the iron, he saved me from the cold, by giving me, not half of his coat, as Saint Martin did, but by giving me the whole of it; then from hunger, by sharing with me, guess what?
039.140 --A pâté from Félix's? asked Beauchamp.
039.141 --No, his horse, of which we each ate a piece with great appetite: it was hard.
039.142 --The horse? asked Morcerf, laughing.
039.143 -- No, the sacrifice, replied Château-Renaud. Ask Debray if he would sacrifice his English for a stranger?
039.144 --For a stranger, no, said Debray, but for a friend, perhaps.
039.145 --I guessed that you would become mine, Monsieur le Baron, said Morrel; besides, I have already had the honor of telling you, heroism or not, sacrifice or not, that day I owed an offering to bad fortune as a reward for the favor that the good one had once done us.
039.146 - "This story to which M. Morrel alludes," continued Château-Renaud, "is a whole admirable story which he will tell you one day, when you have made a fuller acquaintance with him; for today, let us fill the stomach and not the memory. What time do you have breakfast, Albert?
039.147 -- At half past ten.
039.148 --Precises?" asked Debray, pulling out his watch.
039.149 --Oh, you will give me the five minutes' grace, said Morcerf, for I too am waiting for a savior.
039.150 --To whom?
039.151 -- To me, parbleu!" replied Morcerf. I am not a man who can be saved like any other, and that only the Arabs cut off his head! Our lunch is a philanthropic lunch, and we shall have at our table, I hope at least, two benefactors of humanity.
039.152 --How will we do it? says Debray, we have only one Montyon prize?
039.153 --Well, we'll give it to someone who has done nothing to get it, said Beauchamp. That's the way the Academy usually gets out of trouble.
039.154 --And where does it come from? asked Debray; excuse the insistence; you have already, I know, answered this question, but vaguely enough for me to ask it a second time.
039.155 -- In truth, said Albert, I don't know. When I invited him three months ago, he was in Rome; but since then, who can say how far he has come!
039.156 -- And do you think he is capable of being exact?
039.157 -- I believe him capable of everything, replied Morcerf.
039.158 --Beware that with the five minutes of grace, we have only ten minutes left.
039.159 --Well, I'll take advantage of it to say a word about my guest.
039.160 --Pardon, said Beauchamp, is there any material for a serial in what you are going to tell us?
039.161 --Yes, certainly," said Morcerf, "and most curious, too.
039.162 --Say so, for I see that I shall miss the House; I must make up for it.
039.163 --I was in Rome last Carnival.
039.164 --We know that, said Beauchamp.
039.165 -- Yes, but what you don't know is that I was kidnapped by brigands.
039.166 --There are no brigands, said Debray.
039.167 -- Yes, there are, and hideous ones at that, that is, admirable ones, for I found them so beautiful as to frighten.
039.168 --Let us see, my dear Albert," said Debray, "admit that your cook is late, that the oysters have not arrived from Marennes or Ostend, and that, following the example of Mme. de Maintenon, you want to replace the dish by a count. Say it, my dear, we are good enough company to forgive you and to listen to your story, as fabulous as it promises to be.
039.169 -- And I tell you, fabulous as it is, I give it to you as true from one end to the other. The robbers had taken me away and led me to a very sad place called the catacombs of San Sebastian.
039.170 --I know that," said Château-Renaud, "I almost caught a fever there.
039.171 --And I did better than that, said Morcerf, I really had it. I had been told that I was a prisoner unless I was ransomed, a pittance, four thousand Roman ecus, twenty-six thousand livres tournois. Unfortunately I had only fifteen hundred left; I was at the end of my journey and my credit was exhausted. I wrote to Franz. I wrote to Franz that if he didn't arrive at six o'clock in the morning with the four thousand crowns, at ten minutes past six I would have joined the blessed saints and glorious martyrs in whose company I had the honor to be. And Mr. Luigi Vampa, that is the name of my chief of brigands, would have kept his word to me, I beg you to believe, scrupulously.
039.172 --But Franz arrived with the four thousand écus? said Château-Renaud. What on earth! one is not embarrassed for four thousand écus when one is called Franz d'Épinay or Albert de Morcerf.
039.173 -- No, he arrived purely and simply accompanied by the guest whom I announce to you and whom I hope to introduce to you.
039.174 --Ah, but is this gentleman a Hercules killing Cacus, a Perseus delivering Andromeda?
039.175 -- No, he is a man of about my size.
039.176 --With teeth?
039.177 --He didn't even have a knitting needle.
039.178 --But he dealt with your ransom?
039.179 -- He said two words in the ear of the chief, and I was free.
039.180 -- He was even apologized to for having arrested you, said Beauchamp.
039.181 -- Just so, said Morcerf.
039.182 --Ah, but was that man Ariosto?
039.183 -- No, it was simply the Count of Monte Cristo.
039.184 -- We are not called the Count of Monte Cristo, said Debray.
039.185 --I don't think so, added Château-Renaud with the composure of a man who knows his European nobility at the tip of his finger; who knows a Count of Monte Cristo anywhere?
039.186 --He may come from the Holy Land, said Beauchamp; one of his ancestors will have possessed Calvary, like the Mortemarts the Dead Sea.
039.187 --Pardon, said Maximilian, but I think I'll get you out of trouble, gentlemen; Monte Cristo is a little island of which I have often heard the sailors my father employed speak: a grain of sand in the middle of the Mediterranean, an atom in the infinite.
039.188 -That is exactly what it is, sir! said Albert. Well, from this grain of sand, from this atom, is lord and king the one of whom I speak to you; he will have bought this patent of count somewhere in Tuscany.
039.189 -- Is he rich, then, your count?
039.190 --My goodness, I believe so.
039.191 --But it must be obvious, it seems to me?
039.192 -- That is what deceives you, Debray.
039.193 --I no longer understand you.
039.194 --Have you read the _Thousand and One Nights_?
039.195 --Such a good question!
039.196 --Well, do you know whether the people you see there are rich or poor? Whether their wheat grains are not rubies or diamonds? They look like miserable fishermen, don't they? You treat them as such, and suddenly they open some mysterious cave, where you find a treasure to buy India.
039.197 --Afterwards?
039.198 --Afterwards, my Count of Monte Cristo is one of those fishermen. He even has a name taken from the thing, he is called Simbad the sailor and has a cave full of gold.
039.199 --And have you seen this cave, Morcerf?
039.200 -- No, not I, Franz. But, hush! you must not say a word about it in front of him. I am not a man of the world, and I am not a man of the world, and I am not a man of the world, and I am not a man of the world, and I am not a man of the world. Only of the women he is not quite sure, seeing that they entered only after he had eaten hashish; so that it might well be that what he took for women was simply a quadrille of statues."
039.201 The young men looked at Morcerf with an eye that meant:
039.202 "Ah, my dear, are you becoming foolish, or are you making fun of us?
039.203 --In fact," said Morrel thoughtfully, "I have heard an old sailor named Penelon say something similar to what M. de Morcerf is saying.
039.204 --Ah!" said Albert, "it is very fortunate that M. Morrel comes to my aid. It upsets you, doesn't it, that he should throw a bundle of wire into my labyrinth?
039.205 --Pardon, dear friend, says Debray, it is that you tell us such unbelievable things....
039.206 --Ah my goodness! because your ambassadors, your consuls do not speak to you about it! They don't have time, they have to molest their compatriots who travel.
039.207 --Ah, well, here you are, getting angry, and you fall on our poor agents. My God, what do you expect them to protect you with? The House is cutting their salaries every day, to the point where they can no longer find any. Do you want to be an ambassador, Albert? I will have you appointed to Constantinople.
039.208 --No! so that the Sultan, at the first demonstration I make in favor of Mehemet-Ali, will send me the cord and my secretaries will strangle me.
039.209 --You see well, said Debray.
039.210 --Yes, but all this does not prevent my Count of Monte Cristo from existing!
039.211 --Goddamn it! Everyone exists, the beautiful miracle!
039.212 --All the world exists, no doubt, but not under such conditions. Not everyone has black slaves, princely galleries, weapons as at the casauba, horses worth six thousand francs each, Greek mistresses!
039.213 -Have you seen her, the Greek mistress?
039.214 --Yes, I have seen her and heard her. Seen at the Valle theater, heard one day when I had lunch at the Count's house.
039.215 -- Does he eat, then, your extraordinary man?
039.216 -- Well, if he eats, it is so little that it is not worth talking about it.
039.217 --You will see that he is a vampire.
039.218 -Laugh if you want. That was the opinion of the Countess G..., who, as you know, knew Lord Ruthwen.
039.219 --Ah! pretty! said Beauchamp, here is for a non-journalist man the counterpart of the famous sea serpent of the _constitutional_; a vampire, that is perfect!
039.220 --Fawn-colored eyes, whose prism diminishes and dilates at will, said Debray; developed facial angle, magnificent forehead, livid complexion, black beard, white and sharp teeth, politeness all the same.
039.221 --Well, that's just it, Lucien," said Morcerf, "and the description is traced line for line. Yes, sharp and incisive politeness. This man has often given me the shivers; one day, among others, when we were watching an execution together, I thought I was going to feel bad, much more to see him and to hear him talk coldly about all the torments of the earth, than to see the executioner carry out his office and to hear the cries of the patient.
039.222 -- Did he not lead you a little way into the ruins of the Colosseum to suck your blood, Morcerf?
039.223 -- Or, after having delivered you, did he not make you sign some parchment the color of fire, by which you ceded him your soul, like Esau his birthright?
039.224 -Rail! mock all you like, gentlemen! When I look at you, you beautiful Parisians, regulars of the Boulevard de Gand, walkers in the Bois de Boulogne, and I remember this man, well, it seems to me that we are not of the same species.
039.225 -- I flatter myself! said Beauchamp.
039.226 --The fact remains, added Château-Renaud, that your Count of Monte Cristo is a gallant man in his spare moments, except, however, for his little arrangements with the Italian bandits.
039.227 --Eh! there are no Italian bandits! said Debray.
039.228 --No vampires! added Beauchamp.
039.229 --No Count of Monte Cristo, added Debray. Here, dear Albert, it's half past ten.
039.230 --Admit that you have had a nightmare, and let's have lunch," said Beauchamp.
039.231 But the vibration of the clock had not yet died away, when the door opened, and Germain announced:
039.232 "His Excellency the Count of Monte Cristo!"
039.233 All the listeners made in spite of themselves a leap which denoted the preoccupation which Morcerf's narrative had infiltrated into their souls. Albert himself could not resist a sudden emotion.
039.234 Neither carriages were heard in the street nor footsteps in the antechamber; the door itself had opened without a sound.
039.235 The Count appeared on the threshold, dressed with the greatest simplicity, but the most exacting _lion_ would have found nothing to fault in his toilette. Everything was of exquisite taste, everything came from the hands of the most elegant suppliers, clothes, hat and linen.
039.236 He appeared to be barely thirty-five years old, and what struck everyone was his extreme resemblance to the portrait Debray had drawn of him.
039.237 The Count walked smilingly into the middle of the salon, and came straight to Albert, who, walking in front of him, offered his hand eagerly.
039.238 "Accuracy," said Monte Cristo, "is the politeness of kings, as I believe one of our sovereigns has claimed. But whatever their good will, it is not always that of travelers. However I hope, my dear viscount, that you will excuse, in favor of my good will, the two or three seconds of delay that I think I put in appearing at the rendezvous. Five hundred leagues are not done without some annoyance, especially in France, where it is forbidden, it seems, to beat the postilions.
039.239 --Monsieur le comte, replied Albert, I was announcing your visit to some of my friends whom I have gathered together on the occasion of the promise you have been kind enough to make to me, and whom I have the honor of introducing to you. They are M. le Comte de Château-Renaud, whose nobility goes back to the Twelve Peers, and whose ancestors had their place at the Round Table; M. Lucien Debray, private secretary to the Minister of the Interior; M. Beauchamp, a terrible journalist, the dread of the French government, but of whom perhaps, in spite of his national fame, you have never heard in Italy, since his newspaper does not enter it; finally M. Maximilien Morrel, captain of the Spahis."
039.240 At this name the count, who had hitherto saluted courteously, but with a coldness and impassivity that were all English, took a step forward in spite of himself, and a slight tone of vermilion passed like lightning over his pale cheeks.
039.241 "Monsieur is wearing the uniform of the new French victors," he said, "it is a fine uniform."
039.242 One could not have said what was the feeling that gave the Count's voice such a deep vibration and that made his eye shine, as if in spite of himself, so beautiful, so calm and so limpid, when he had no motive whatsoever to veil it.
039.243 "You had never seen our Africans, sir?" said Albert.
039.244 -- "Never," replied the Count, once again perfectly free of himself.
039.245 --Well, sir, under this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest hearts of the army.
039.246 --Oh, Monsieur le Comte," interrupted Morrel.
039.247 --Let me say, Captain .... And we have just," continued Albert, "learned from monsieur a fact so heroic, that, though I have seen him to-day for the first time, I claim from him the favor of presenting him to you as my friend."
039.248 And one could still, at these words, notice in Monte Cristo that strange look of fixity, that furtive blush and that slight trembling of the eyelid which, in him, detected emotion.
039.249 "Ah, Monsieur is a noble heart," said the Count, "so much the better!"
039.250 This sort of exclamation, which responded to the count's own thought rather than to what Albert had just said, surprised everyone and especially Morrel, who looked at Monte Cristo with astonishment. But at the same time the intonation was so soft and, so to speak, so sweet that, however strange this exclamation was, there was no way to be angry about it.
039.251 "Why should he doubt it?" said Beauchamp to Château-Renaud.
039.252 --In truth," replied the latter, who, with his habit of the world and the sharpness of his aristocratic eye, had penetrated all that was penetrable in Monte Cristo, "in truth Albert has not deceived us, and he is a singular character, the Count.
039.253 -My faith, said the latter, he has a frank eye and a sympathetic voice, so that I like him, in spite of the strange reflection he has just made about me.
039.254 --Messieurs, said Albert, Germain announces to me that you are served. My dear Count, allow me to show you the way."
039.255 They passed silently into the dining room. Each took his place.
039.256 "Gentlemen," said the Count as he sat down, "allow me an admission which will be my excuse for any impropriety I may make: I am a foreigner, but a foreigner to such an extent that this is the first time I have been in Paris. French life is therefore completely unknown to me, and until now I have only practiced oriental life, which is the most unsympathetic to good Parisian traditions. I therefore beg your pardon if you find in me something too Turkish, too Neapolitan or too Arabian. That said, gentlemen, let us have lunch.
039.257 --How he says all that!" murmured Beauchamp; "he is definitely a great lord.
039.258 --A great lord, added Debray.
039.259 --A great lord of all countries, Mr. Debray", said Château-Renaud.
040.000 The lunch.
040.001 The count, one remembers it, was a sober guest. Albert made the remark by testifying the fear that, from its beginning, the Parisian life displeased the traveler by its most material side, but at the same time the most necessary.
040.002 "My dear count, he said, you see me affected of a fear, it is that the kitchen of the street of the Helder does not please you as much as that of the place of Spain. I should have asked you your taste and made you prepare some dishes to your imagination.
040.003 - "If you knew me better, sir," replied the Count, smiling, "you would not be concerned with a care that is almost humiliating for a traveler like me, who has successively lived on macaroni in Naples, polenta in Milan, olla podrida in Valencia, pilau in Constantinople, karrick in India, and swallow's nests in China. There is no cuisine for a cosmopolitan like me. I eat everything and everywhere, only I eat little; and today that you reproach me my sobriety, I am in my day of appetite, because since yesterday morning I did not eat.
040.004 -- What do you mean, since yesterday morning! cried the guests; you have not eaten for twenty-four hours?
040.005 -- No, answered Monte-Cristo; I had been obliged to deviate from my road and to take information in the surroundings of Nimes, so that I was a little late, and I did not want to stop.
040.006 -- And you ate in your car? asked Morcerf.
040.007 -- No, I slept as it happens to me when I am bored without having the courage to distract me, or when I am hungry without wanting to eat.
040.008 --But you command sleep, sir? asked Morrel.
040.009 -- Almost.
040.010 -- Do you have a recipe for that ?
040.011 -- Infallible.
040.012 -- That would be excellent for us Africans, who don't always have enough to eat, and who rarely have enough to drink, said Morrel.
040.013 -- Yes, said Monte-Cristo; unfortunately my recipe, excellent for a man like me, who leads an exceptional life, would be very dangerous applied to an army, which would not wake up when it would be needed.
040.014 -- And can we know what is this recipe? asked Debray.
040.015 -- Oh, my God, yes," said Monte Cristo, "I make no secret of it: it is a mixture of excellent opium, which I went to Canton to get myself in order to be sure of having it pure, and of the best hashish which is harvested in the East, that is to say, between the Tigris and the Euphrates; these two ingredients are combined in equal portions, and a sort of pill is made which is swallowed at the moment of need. Ten minutes later the effect is produced. Ask Mr. Baron Franz d'Épinay, I believe that he tasted some one day.
040.016 -- Yes, answered Morcerf, he told me some words of it and he even kept a very pleasant memory of it.
040.017 --But said Beauchamp, who in his capacity of journalist was very incredulous, you thus carry always this drug on you?
040.018 - Always, answered Monte-Cristo.
040.019 - Would it be indiscreet to ask you to see these precious pills? continued Beauchamp, hoping to catch the stranger off guard.
040.020 -- No, sir", answered the Count.
040.021 And he drew from his pocket a marvelous candy box dug in a single emerald and closed by a gold nut which, while unscrewing, gave passage to a small ball of greenish color and of the size of a pea. This ball had an acrid and penetrating odor; there were four or five similar in the emerald, and it could contain a dozen of them.
040.022 The candy box went around the table, but it was much more to examine this admirable emerald than to see or to smell the pills, that the guests made pass it.
040.023 "And it is your cook who prepares you this treat? asked Beauchamp.
040.024 -- No, sir, said Monte Cristo, I do not deliver my real enjoyments to the mercy of unworthy hands. I am quite a good chemist, and I prepare my pills myself.
040.025 -- Here is an admirable emerald and the biggest that I ever saw, although my mother has some rather remarkable family jewels, said Château-Renaud.
040. 026 -- I had three such, said Monte Cristo: I gave one to the Great Lord, who had it mounted on his sword; the other to our holy father the pope, who had it inlaid on his tiara opposite an emerald about the same, but less beautiful, which had been given to his predecessor, Pius VII, by the emperor Napoleon; I kept the third one for myself, and I had it hollowed out, which took away half of its value, but which made it more convenient for the use I wanted to make of it. "
040.027 Each one looked at Monte-Cristo with astonishment; he spoke with so much simplicity, that it was obvious that he spoke the truth or that he was insane; however the emerald which had remained between his hands made that one leaned naturally towards the first assumption.
040.028 "And what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange of this magnificent gift?
040.029 - The Great Lord, the freedom of a woman, answered the count; our holy father the pope, the life of a man. So that once in my existence I was as powerful as if God had made me be born on the steps of a throne.
040.030 -- And it is Peppino that you delivered, isn't it? cried Morcerf; it is to him that you made the application of your right of grace?
040.031 - Perhaps, said Monte-Cristo smiling.
040.032 --Monsieur le Comte, you do not imagine the pleasure I feel to hear you speak thus! said Morcerf. I had announced you beforehand to my friends as a fabulous man, as an enchanter of the Thousand and One Nights; as a sorcerer of the Middle Ages; but the Parisians are people so subtle in paradoxes, that they take for caprices of the imagination the most unquestionable truths, when these truths do not fit into all the conditions of their daily existence. For example, here is Debray reading, and Beauchamp printing every day, that a member of the Jockey-Club has been arrested and robbed on the boulevard; that four people have been murdered in the rue Saint-Denis or in the faubourg Saint-Germain; that ten, fifteen, twenty thieves have been arrested, either in a café on the boulevard du Temple, or in the Thermes de Julien, and they dispute the existence of the bandits of the Maremmes, of the countryside of Rome, or of the Pontine swamps. Tell them yourself, I beg you, Mr. Count, that I have been taken by these bandits, and that, without your generous intercession, I would, in all probability, be waiting today for eternal resurrection in the catacombs of Saint Sebastian, instead of giving them dinner in my unworthy little house in the Rue du Helder.
040.033 - "Bah!" said Monte-Cristo, "you promised never to speak to me about this misery.
040.034 -It is not me, Mr. Count! cried Morcerf, it is some other to whom you will have done the same service as to me and whom you will have confused with me. Let us speak about it, on the contrary, I pray you; for if you decide to speak about this circumstance, perhaps you will not only tell me again a little of what I know, but also a lot of what I do not know.
040.035 --But it seems to me, said the Count smiling, that you played in all this affair a role important enough to know as well as I what happened.
040.036 -- Will you promise me, if I tell you all I know," said Morcerf, "that you will tell me all I don't know?
040.037 -- It is too just, answered Monte-Cristo.
040.038 -- Well, said Morcerf, even if my self-esteem had to suffer, I thought I was for three days the object of the annoyances of a mask that I took for some descendant of the Tullie or Poppea, while I was purely and simply the object of the annoyances of a contadienne; and notice that I say contadienne not to say peasant. What I do know is that, like a fool, even more foolish than the one I was talking about earlier, I took for this peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or sixteen, with a beardless chin and a slim waist, who, when I wanted to emancipate myself to the point of placing a kiss on her chaste shoulder, put the pistol to my throat, and, with the help of seven or eight of his companions led me, or rather dragged me, to the depths of the catacombs of San Sebastian, where I found a very literate chief of bandits, who was reading the Commentaries of Caesar, and who deigned to interrupt his reading to tell me that if I had not paid four thousand écus into his coffer at six o'clock in the morning the next day, I would have ceased to exist perfectly. The letter exists, it is in Franz's hands, signed by me, with a postscript from Master Luigi Vampa. If you doubt it, I'll write to Franz, who will have the signatures legalized. This is what I know. Now, what I don't know is how you managed, Mr. Count, to strike with such great respect the bandits of Rome, who respect so little. I confess to you that, Franz and me, we were delighted of admiration.
040.039 - Nothing more simple, sir, answered the count, I knew the famous Vampa for more than ten years. When he was very young and still a shepherd, one day that I gave him I don't know what gold coin because he had shown me my way, he gave me, to owe nothing to me, a dagger carved by him and that you must have seen in my collection of weapons. Later, either he had forgotten this exchange of small gifts which should have maintained the friendship between us, or that he had not recognized me, he tried to stop me; but it was me on the contrary who took him with a dozen of his people. I could have handed him over to the Roman justice system, which is expeditious and would have hastened in his favor, but I did not do so. I sent him and his people away.
040.040 -- On condition that they would not sin again, said the journalist, laughing. I see with pleasure that they have scrupulously kept their word.
040.041 -- No, sir, replied Monte-Cristo, on the simple condition that they would always respect me and my people. Perhaps what I am going to say will seem strange to you, gentlemen socialists, progressives, humanitarians; but I never care for my neighbor, but I never try to protect the society which does not protect me, and, I will even say more, which generally cares for me only to harm me; and, by suppressing them in my esteem and by keeping neutrality with regard to them, it is still the society and my neighbor who owe me a return
040.042 -- Good! cried Château-Renaud, here is the first courageous man that I hear preaching loyally and brutally the egoism: it is very beautiful, that! bravo, Mr. the count!
040.043 - It is frank at least, said Morrel; but I am sure that Mr. the count did not repent to have missed once the principles which he has however just exposed to us in a so absolute way.
040.044 --How did I fail in these principles, sir?" asked Monte-Cristo, who from time to time could not help looking at Maximilian with so much attention, that two or three times already the bold young man had lowered his eyes before the clear and limpid glance of the count.
040.045 "But it seems to me," said Morrel, "that by delivering Mr. de Morcerf, whom you did not know, you were serving your neighbor and society.
040.046 - Of which he makes the most beautiful ornament, said Beauchamp gravely while emptying of only one glass of wine of Champagne.
040.047 --Monsieur le comte! exclaimed Morcerf, you are caught by reasoning, you, that is to say one of the roughest logicians that I know; and you will see that it will be clearly demonstrated to you just now that, far from being an egoist, you are on the contrary a philanthropist. Ah, Monsieur le Comte, you call yourself Oriental, Levantine, Malay, Indian, Chinese, savage; you call yourself Monte Cristo by your family name, Simbad the sailor by your baptismal name, and here you are, from the day you set foot in Paris, instinctively possessing the greatest merit or the greatest defect of our eccentric Parisians, that is to say, that you usurp the vices that you do not have, and that you hide the virtues that you do have!
040.048 - "My dear Viscount," said Monte Cristo, "I do not see in all that I have said or done a single word which merits for me, on your part and on the part of these gentlemen, the alleged praise which I have just received. You were not a stranger for me, since I knew you, since I had given you two rooms, since I had given you lunch, since I had lent you one of my cars, since we had seen the masks pass together in the street of the Course, and since we had watched from a window of the Piazza del Popolo that execution that impressed you so much that you almost felt sick. Now, I ask all these gentlemen, could I leave my guest in the hands of these awful bandits, as you call them? Besides, as you know, I had, by saving you, an ulterior motive which was to use you to introduce myself in the salons of Paris when I would come to visit France. For a while you could consider this resolution as a vague and fleeting project; but today, you see it, it is a good and beautiful reality, to which you must submit under penalty of breaking your word.
040.049 --And I will keep it, said Morcerf; but I am afraid that you will be very disenchanted, my dear count, you, accustomed to the rugged sites, the picturesque events, the fantastic horizons. With us, not the slightest episode of the kind to which your adventurous life has accustomed you. Our Chimborazzo is Montmartre; our Himalayas is Mount Valérien; our Great Desert is the plain of Grenelle, where an artesian well is drilled so that the caravans can find water. We have thieves, many of them, although we don't have as many as they say, but these thieves fear the smallest snitch infinitely more than the greatest lord; Finally, France is such a prosaic country, and Paris such a highly civilized city, that you will not find in our eighty-five departments, I say eighty-five departments, for, of course, I exclude Corsica from France, that you will not find in our eighty-five departments the slightest mountain on which there is not a telegraph, and the slightest slightly dark cave in which a police commissioner has not had a gas burner installed. There is therefore only one service I can render you, my dear Count, and for that I place myself at your disposal: to introduce you everywhere, or to have you introduced by my friends, that goes without saying. Besides, you don't need anybody for that; with your name, your fortune and your spirit (Monte-Cristo bowed with a slightly ironic smile), one presents oneself everywhere, and one is well received everywhere. I can only be good to you in reality for one thing. If some habit of Parisian life, some experience of comfort, some knowledge of our bazaars can recommend me to you, I put myself at your disposal to find you a suitable house. I do not dare to propose to you to share my lodging as I shared yours in Rome, I who do not profess selfishness, but who am selfish par excellence; because in my house, except me, it would not hold a shade, unless this shade were that of a woman.
040.050 - "Oh," said the Count, "this is a very conjugal reserve. You have indeed, sir, said to me in Rome a few words about a marriage in the making; shall I congratulate you on your forthcoming happiness?
040.051 - The thing is always in the state of project, Mr. the count.
040.052 -- And who says project, resumed Debray, means eventuality.
040.053 -- Not! said Morcerf; my father wants it, and I hope, before long, to present you, if not my wife, at least my future: mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars.
040.054 -- Eugenie Danglars! said Monte-Cristo; wait: isn't her father Mr. Baron Danglars?
040.055 -- Yes, answered Morcerf; but baron of new creation.
040.056 -- What does it matter? replied Monte-Cristo, if he has rendered to the State services which have merited this distinction.
040.057 - Enormous, said Beauchamp. He has, although a liberal at heart, completed in 1829 a loan of six millions for King Charles X, who made him a baron and a knight of the Legion of Honor, so that he wears the ribbon, not in his vest pocket, as one might think, but in the buttonhole of his suit.
040.058 --Ah! said Morcerf laughing, Beauchamp, Beauchamp, save that for _Le Corsaire and Le Charivari_ but before me spare my future father-in-law."
040.059 Then turning to Monte-Cristo:
040.060 "But you have just now pronounced his name as one who would know the baron?" he said.
040.061 -- I do not know him, said Monte-Cristo carelessly; but I will probably not delay to make his acquaintance, since I have a credit opened on him by the houses Richard and Blount of London, Arstein and Eskeles of Vienna, and Thomson and French of Rome."
040.062 And while pronouncing these two last names, Monte-Cristo looked at Maximilien Morrel from the corner of his eye.
040.063 If the stranger had expected to produce an effect on Maximilien Morrel, he had not been mistaken. Maximilien flinched as if he had received an electric shock.
040.064 "Thomson and French," he said, "do you know this house, sir?
040.065 --These are my bankers in the capital of the Christian world, answered the Count quietly; may I be of some use to you with them.
040.066 -- Oh! Mr. Count, you could perhaps help us in research until now fruitless; this house formerly made a service to ours, and always, I do not know why, denied to have made us this service.
040.067 -- At your orders, sir, answered Monte-Cristo while bowing.
040.068 - But said Morcerf, we singularly deviated, about Mr. Danglars, from the subject of our conversation. It was a question of finding a suitable dwelling for the Count of Monte Cristo; let us see, gentlemen, to have an idea. Where shall we lodge this new guest of the Grand-Paris?
040.069 --Faubourg Saint-Germain, says Château-Renaud: sir will find there a charming small hotel between court, and garden.
040.070 --Bah! Château-Renaud, said Debray, you only know your sad and sullen faubourg Saint-Germain, don't listen to him, Mr. Count, lodge in Chaussée-d'Antin: it is the true center of Paris.
040.071 --Boulevard de l'Opéra, said Beauchamp; on the second floor, a house with a balcony. Mr. Count will have cushions of silver cloth brought there, and will see, while smoking his shibboleth, or while swallowing his pills, all the capital passing under his eyes.
040.072 -- Don't you have any ideas, you, Morrel, says Château-Renaud, that you don't propose anything?
040.073 --So, the young man said smiling; on the contrary, I have one, but I waited that the gentleman let himself be tempted by one of the brilliant offers which one has just made him. Now, as he did not answer, I believe to be able to offer him an apartment in a small charming hotel, all Pompadour, which my sister has just rented for one year in the street Meslay.
040.074 -- You have a sister? asked Monte-Cristo.
040.075 -- Yes, sir, and an excellent sister.
040.076 --Married?
040.077 --For nearly nine years.
040.078 --Happy? asked again the count.
040.079 - As happy as it is allowed to a human creature to be, answered Maximilien: she married the man she loved, the one who remained faithful to us in our bad fortune: Emmanuel Herbault."
040.080 Monte-Cristo smiled imperceptibly.
040.081 "I live there during my semester," continued Maximilien, "and I shall be, with my brother-in-law Emmanuel, at the disposal of Monsieur le Comte for all the information he will need.
040.082 -- One moment!" cried Albert before Monte-Cristo had time to answer, "be careful what you do, Mr. Morrel, you are going to shut up a traveler, Simbad the sailor, in the life of the family; a man who came to see Paris you are going to make a patriarch of him.
040.083 -- Oh, no, not at all," replied Morrel, smiling, "my sister is twenty-five, my brother-in-law is thirty: they are young, gay, and happy; besides, the Count will be at home, and he will meet his guests only as often as he likes.
040.084 --Thank you, sir, thank you, said Monte-Cristo, I will be satisfied to be presented by you to your sister and your brother-in-law, if you want to do me this honor; but I did not accept the offer of either of these gentlemen, since I already have my house all ready.
040.085 - "What!" cried Morcerf, "are you going to go down to the hotel? It will be very gloomy for you, that.
040.086 -- Was I so bad in Rome? asked Monte-Cristo.
040.087 - "By Jove! In Rome," said Morcerf, "you had spent fifty thousand piastres to furnish you an apartment; but I presume that you are not disposed to renew every day such an expenditure.
040.088 - "That is not what stopped me," replied Monte Cristo; "but I was resolved to have a house in Paris, a house of my own, I mean. I sent my valet in advance, and he had to buy this house and furnish it for me.
040.089 - But tell us that you have a valet who knows Paris!
040.090 - It is the first time like me that he comes in France; he is Black and does not speak, said Monte-Cristo.
040.091 - So, it's Ali? asked Albert in the middle of the general surprise.
040.092 -- Yes, sir, it is Ali himself, my Nubian, my mute, whom you saw in Rome, I believe.
040.093 -- Yes, certainly, answered Morcerf, I remember it marvelously. But how did you get a Nubian to buy you a house in Paris, and a mute to furnish it for you? He did everything wrong, the poor wretch.
I am sure, on the contrary, that he will have chosen everything according to my taste; for, as you know, my taste is not that of everybody. He arrived eight days ago; he will have run all over the city with the instinct of a good dog hunting by itself; he knows my whims, my fancies, my needs; he will have organized everything to my liking. He knew that I would arrive today at ten o'clock; since nine o'clock he has been waiting for me at the barrier of Fontainebleau; he gave me this paper; it is my new address: here, read."
040.095 And Monte-Cristo passed a paper to Albert.
040.096 "Champs-Élysées, 30, read Morcerf.
040.097 --Ah! this is really original! could not help saying Beauchamp.
040.098 --And very princely, added Château-Renaud.
040.099 --How! you don't know your house? asked Debray.
040.100 -- No, said Monte-Cristo, I already told you that I did not want to miss the hour. I made my toilet in my carriage and I went down to the door of the viscount."
040.101 The young people looked at each other; they did not know whether this was a comedy played by Monte Cristo; but everything that came out of the mouth of this man had, in spite of his original character, such a stamp of simplicity, that one could not suppose that he must be lying. Moreover why would he have lied?
040.102 "We will have to be content," said Beauchamp, "to render Mr. the Count all the small services that will be in our power. I, in my capacity of journalist, I open to him all the theaters of Paris.
040.103 --Thank you, sir, said Monte-Cristo smiling; my intendant has already the order to rent me a box in each one of them.
040.104 --And is your intendant also a Nubian, a mute? asked Debray.
040.105 -- No, sir, he is simply a compatriot of yours, if a Corsican is a compatriot of someone: but you know him, Mr. de Morcerf.
040.106 -Would it be by chance the good signor Bertuccio, who is so good at renting windows?
040.107 -- Indeed, and you saw him at my house the day I had the honor to receive you at lunch. He is a very good man, who has been a bit of a soldier, a bit of a smuggler, a bit of everything. I would not even swear that he has not had some trouble with the police for a misery, something like a knife wound.
040.108 --And you have chosen this honest citizen of the world for your steward, Mr. Count?
040.109 --Well, my word of honor, said the Count, no more than any other, I'm sure; but he does my business, knows no impossibilities, and I keep him.
040.110 - "So," said Château-Renaud, "here you are, with a mounted house: you have a hotel at the Champs-Élysées, servants, steward, you only need a mistress."
040.111 Albert smiled, he was thinking of the beautiful Greek woman whom he had seen in the Count's box at the Valle and Argentina theaters.
040.112 "I have better than that, said Monte-Cristo: I have a slave. You rent your mistresses at the Opera, at the Vaudeville theater, at the Variety theater; I bought mine at Constantinople; it cost me more, but, in this respect, I don't need to worry about anything.
040.113 - But you forget, says Debray laughing, that we are, as king Charles said, free in name, free in nature; that by setting foot on the ground of France, your slave became free?
040.114 -- Who will tell him? asked Monte-Cristo.
040.115 - But, lady! the first one who comes.
040.116 -- She speaks only the roman language.
040.117 --Then it's another thing.
040.118 --But will we see her, at least? asked Beauchamp, or, having already a mute, do you also have eunuchs?
040.119 - "No," said Monte-Cristo, "I don't push orientalism to that point: all that surrounds me is free to leave me, and by leaving me won't need me or anybody else anymore; that's perhaps why they don't leave me.
040.120 For a long time one had passed to the dessert and the cigars.
040.121 "My dear, said Debray while rising, it is two hours and half, your guest is charming, but there is not so good company that one does not leave, and sometimes even for the bad one; I must return to my ministry. I will speak about the count to the minister, and it will be necessary that we know who he is.
040.122 - Beware, said Morcerf, the cleverest have given up.
040.123 --Bah! we have three millions for our police force: it is true that they are almost always spent in advance; but it does not matter; there will always remain about fifty thousand francs to put to that.
040.124 -- And when you know who he is, you will tell me?
040.125 -- I promise. Good-bye, Albert; gentlemen, your most humble."
040.126 And, while leaving, Debray shouted very high in the antechamber:
040.127 "Make advance!
040.128 - Well, said Beauchamp to Albert, I will not go to the House, but I have to offer to my readers better than a speech of Mr. Danglars.
040.129 --Please, Beauchamp, said Morcerf, not a word, I beg you; do not take away from me the merit of presenting and explaining it: is it not curious?
040.130 -- He is better than that," replied Château-Renaud, "and he is really one of the most extraordinary men I have seen in my life. Are you coming, Morrel?
040.131 --The time to give my card to Mr. the count, who wants to promise me to come to make us a small visit, street Meslay, 14.
040.132 --Be sure that I will not fail to do so, sir", said the Count, bowing.
040.133 And Maximilien Morrel left with the baron of Château-Renaud, leaving Monte-Cristo alone with Morcerf.
041.000 The presentation.
041.001 When Albert found himself face to face with Monte-Cristo:
041.002 "Monsieur le Comte," he said to him, "allow me to begin my profession of cicerone with you by giving you the specimen of a boy's apartment. Accustomed to the palaces of Italy, it will be a study for you to calculate in how many square feet can live one of the young people of Paris who do not pass for being the most badly housed. As we pass from one room to another, we will open the windows so that you can breathe."
041.003 Monte Cristo was already familiar with the dining room and the living room on the first floor. Albert led him first to his studio; it was, we remember, his favorite room.
041.004 Monte Cristo was a worthy appreciator of all the things that Albert had piled up in this room: old chests, porcelain from Japan, fabrics from the Orient, glassware from Venice, weapons from all the countries of the world, everything was familiar to him, and, at first glance, he recognized the century, the country and the origin.
041.005 Morcerf had thought he was the explainer, and it was he, on the contrary, who was giving a course in archaeology, mineralogy, and natural history under the direction of the count. They went down to the second floor. Albert introduced his guest into the salon. This room was lined with the works of modern painters; there were landscapes by Dupré, with long reeds, slender trees, bellowing cows and wonderful skies; there were the Arab riders of Delacroix, with their long white burnous, their shining belts, their damascene weapons, whose horses bit each other with rage, while the men tore each other apart with masses of iron; there were the watercolors of Boulanger, representing the whole of _Notre-Dame de Paris_ with that vigor which makes of the painter the poet's emulator; there were canvases by Diaz, who makes the flowers more beautiful than the flowers, the sun more brilliant than the sun; drawings by Decamps, as colorful as those of Salvator Rosa, but more poetic; pastels by Giraud and Muller, representing children with the heads of angels, women with the features of virgins; sketches torn from the album of the voyage of the Orient of Dauzats, which had been pencilled in a few seconds on the saddle of a camel or under the dome of a mosque; finally all that modern art can give in exchange and in compensation of the art lost and flown away with the preceding centuries.
041.006 Albert expected to show, this time at least, something new to the strange traveler; but to his great astonishment, this one, without needing to seek the signatures, some of which besides were present only by initials, applied at the very moment the name of each author to his work, so that it was easy to see that not only each one of these names was known to him, but also that each one of these talents had been appreciated and studied by him.
041.007 From the living room one passed into the bedroom. It was at once a model of elegance and of severe taste: there a single portrait, but signed Leopold Robert, shone in its frame of mat gold.
041.008 This portrait first attracted the eyes of the Count of Monte Cristo, for he took three quick steps into the room and suddenly stopped before it.
041.009 It was that of a young woman of twenty-five to twenty-six years of age, with a brown complexion, a fiery gaze, veiled under a languid eyelid; she wore the picturesque costume of the Catalan fisherwomen with her red and black corset and her gold needles pricked in her hair; she was looking out to sea, and her elegant silhouette stood out against the double azure of the waves and the sky.
041.010 It was dark in the room, otherwise Albert could have seen the livid pallor that spread over the Count's cheeks, and surprised the nervous shiver that grazed his shoulders and chest.
041.011 There was a moment of silence, during which Monte Cristo remained with his eye obstinately fixed on this painting.
041.012 "You have a beautiful mistress there, Viscount," said Monte Cristo in a perfectly calm voice, "and this costume, a ball costume no doubt, really suits her.
041.013 - "Ah, sir," said Albert, "here is a misunderstanding which I would not forgive you, if next to this portrait you had seen some other. You do not know my mother, sir; it is she whom you see in this frame; she had herself painted thus, six or eight years ago. This costume is a fancy one, it seems, and the resemblance is so great that I still think I see my mother as she was in 1830. The countess had this portrait done while the count was away. Undoubtedly she thought she was preparing a gracious surprise for his return; but, strangely enough, this portrait displeased my father; and the value of the painting, which is, as you can see, one of Leopold Robert's beautiful canvases, could not override the antipathy in which he had taken it. It is true to say between us, my dear Count, that M. de Morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers in the Luxembourg, a general renowned for his theory, but a most mediocre lover of art; the same cannot be said of my mother, who paints in a remarkable way, and who, esteeming such a work too highly to part with it altogether, gave it to me so that at home it would be less exposed to displease M. de Morcerf, of whom I am sure you are aware. de Morcerf, whose portrait painted by Gros I will show you in turn. Forgive me if I speak to you in this way about the household and the family, but, as I am going to have the honor of taking you to the Count's house, I am telling you this so that it will not escape you to praise this portrait in front of him. Besides, it has a fatal influence; for it is very rare that my mother comes to my house without looking at it, and rarer still that she looks at it without crying. The cloud which the appearance of this painting in the hotel brought about is, moreover, the only one which has arisen between the count and the countess, who, though married for more than twenty years, are still united as on the first day."
041.014 Monte Cristo cast a quick glance at Albert, as if seeking some hidden intention in his words; but it was evident that the young man had said them in all the simplicity of his soul.
041.015 "Now," said Albert, "you have seen all my riches, Monsieur le Comte, allow me to offer them to you, however unworthy they may be; look upon yourself as being here at home, and, to put you still more at your ease, please accompany me to M. de Morcerf, to whom I wrote from Rome of the service you rendered me, and to whom I announced the visit you had promised me; and, I may say, the count and countess were impatiently waiting to be allowed to thank you. You are a little blasé about everything, I know, Count, and family scenes do not have much action on Simbad the sailor: you have seen other scenes! However, accept that I propose to you, as an initiation to Parisian life, the life of politeness, visits and introductions."
041.016 Monte-Cristo bowed to answer; he accepted the proposal without enthusiasm or regret, as one of the social proprieties of which every man as he should make a duty. Albert called his valet, and ordered him to go and warn M. and Mme. de Morcerf of the impending arrival of the Count of Monte Cristo.
041.017 Albert followed him with the Count.
041.018 On arriving in the Count's antechamber, one saw above the door leading into the salon a coat of arms which, by its rich surround and its harmony with the ornamentation of the room, indicated the importance that the owner of the hotel attached to this coat of arms.
041.019 Monte Cristo stopped in front of this coat of arms, which he examined carefully.
041.020 "Azure with seven gold martlets in bend. This is undoubtedly the coat of arms of your family, sir?" he asked. Apart from the knowledge of the pieces of the coat of arms which allows me to decipher it, I am very ignorant in heraldic matters, I, a count of chance, made by Tuscany with the help of a commandery of Saint-Etienne, and who would have done without being a great lord if one had not repeated to me that, when one travels a lot, it is absolutely necessary. After all, it is necessary to have something on the panels of one's car, if only to prevent the customs officers from visiting you. So excuse me if I ask you such a question.
041. 021 -- "It is in no way indiscreet, sir," said Morcerf with the simplicity of conviction, "and you guessed right: these are our arms, that is to say, those of my father's chief; but they are, as you see, attached to an escutcheon which is gules to a silver tower, and which is of my mother's chief; by women I am Spanish, but the house of Morcerf is French, and, as I have heard, even one of the oldest in the South of France.
041.022 --Yes," said Monte Cristo, "that is what the martlets indicate. Almost all the armed pilgrims who attempted or made the conquest of the Holy Land took for arms either crosses, sign of the mission to which they had dedicated themselves, or travelling birds, symbol of the long journey which they were going to undertake and which they hoped to accomplish on the wings of faith. One of your paternal forebears will have been on one of your crusades, and, supposing that it was only that of Saint Louis, that already takes us back to the thirteenth century, which is still very pretty.
041.023 -It is possible, said Morcerf: there is somewhere in my father's cabinet a genealogical tree which will tell us that, and on which I once had comments which would have edified d'Hozier and Jaucourt greatly. Now I no longer think about it; however, I will tell you, sir count, and this falls within the scope of my duties as a cicerone, that one begins to occupy oneself a great deal with these things under our popular government.
041.024 -- Well, then, your government should have chosen something better from its past than these two signs which I noticed on your monuments, and which have no heraldic sense. As for you, viscount," said Monte Cristo, returning to Morcerf, "you are happier than your government, for your arms are truly beautiful and speak to the imagination. Yes, that's right, you are both of Provence and Spain; that explains, if the portrait you showed me is resembling, that beautiful brown color which I admired so much on the face of the noble Catalan."
041.025 One would have had to be Oedipus or the Sphinx himself to guess the irony which the count put into these words, marked in appearance by the greatest politeness; so Morcerf thanked him with a smile, and, passing first to show him the way, pushed open the door which opened below his arms, and which, as we have said, led into the salon.
041. 026 In the most apparent place of this living room was also a portrait; It was that of a man of thirty-five to thirty-eight years, dressed in a general officer's uniform, wearing that double epaulette in a twist, sign of the higher ranks, the ribbon of the Legion of Honor around his neck, which indicated that he was a commander, and on his chest, on the right, the plaque of grand officer of the order of the Savior, and, on the left, that of Grand Cross of Charles III, which indicated that the person represented by this portrait must have fought in the wars of Greece and Spain, or, which is absolutely the same as far as cords are concerned, must have fulfilled some diplomatic mission in both countries.
041.027 Monte Cristo was busy detailing this portrait with no less care than he had done the other, when a side door opened, and he found himself face to face with the Count of Morcerf himself.
041.028 He was a man between forty and forty-five years of age, but who looked at least fifty, and whose moustache and black eyebrows contrasted strangely with almost white hair cut in the military fashion; he was dressed like a bourgeois and wore a ribbon on his buttonhole, the different borders of which recalled the various orders with which he was decorated. This man entered with a rather noble step and with a kind of eagerness. Monte Cristo saw him come to him without taking a single step; it seemed as if his feet were nailed to the floor like his eyes on the face of the Count of Morcerf.
041.029 "My father," said the young man, "I have the honor of presenting to you Monsieur le Comte de Monte-Cristo, that generous friend whom I have had the good fortune to meet in the difficult circumstances of which you are aware.
041.030 --Monsieur is welcome among us," said the Count de Morcerf, greeting Monte Cristo with a smile, "and he has rendered our house, by preserving for it its only heir, a service which will eternally solicit our gratitude."
041.031 And saying these words the Count de Morcerf indicated an armchair to Monte Cristo, at the same time that he himself sat down opposite the window.
041.032 As for Monte Cristo, while taking the chair designated by the Count de Morcerf, he arranged himself in such a way as to remain hidden in the shadow of the large velvet curtains, and to read from there on the features marked by fatigue and worries of the Count a whole history of secret pains written in each of his wrinkles that had come with time.
041.033 "Madame la comtesse," said Morcerf, "was at her toilet when the viscount sent word to her of the visit she was going to have the pleasure of receiving; she is going downstairs, and in ten minutes she will be in the salon.
041.034 -It is a great honor for me, said Monte Cristo, to be thus, from the day of my arrival in Paris, brought into contact with a man whose merit equals his reputation, and for whom fortune, just once, has made no mistake; but has she not yet, in the plains of the Mitidja or in the mountains of the Atlas, a marshal's staff to offer you?
041.035 --Oh! replied Morcerf, blushing a little, I have left the service, sir. Appointed peer under the Restoration, I was of the first campaign, and I served under the orders of Marshal de Bourmont; I could therefore claim a higher command, and who knows what would have happened if the elder branch had remained on the throne! But the July revolution was, as it seems, glorious enough to allow itself to be ungrateful; it was so for any service which did not date from the imperial period; I therefore gave my resignation, because, when one has earned one's epaulettes on the battlefield, one hardly knows how to maneuver on the slippery ground of the salons; I left the sword, I threw myself into politics, I devoted myself to industry, I studied the useful arts. During the twenty years that I had remained in the service, I had had the desire, but I had not had the time.
041.036 --These are the things that maintain the superiority of your nation over other countries, sir, replied Monte-Cristo; a gentleman from a great house, possessing a fine fortune, you first consented to gain the first ranks as an obscure soldier, which is very rare; then, having become a general, a peer of France, a commander of the Legion of Honor, you consent to begin a second apprenticeship again, without any other hope, without any other reward than that of being one day useful to your fellow men.... Ah, sir, that is truly beautiful; I will say more, that is sublime."
041.037 Albert looked and listened to Monte Cristo with astonishment; he was not accustomed to seeing him rise to such ideas of enthusiasm.
041.038 "Alas!" continued the stranger, doubtless to remove the imperceptible cloud which these words had just passed over Morcerf's forehead, "we do not do so in Italy; we grow according to our race and our species, and we keep the same foliage, the same size, and often the same uselessness all our lives.
041.039 --But, sir, replied the Count de Morcerf, for a man of your merit, Italy is not a homeland, and France may not be ungrateful to everyone; she treats her children badly, but usually welcomes foreigners greatly.
041.040 --Eh! my father," said Albert with a smile, "it is clear that you do not know the Count of Monte Cristo. His satisfactions to him are outside this world; he does not aspire to honors, and takes only what can fit on a passport.
041.041 --That, in my regard, is the most accurate expression I have ever heard, replied the stranger.
041.042 --Monsieur has been the master of his future, said the Count de Morcerf with a sigh, and he has chosen the path of flowers.
041.043 --Justly, sir, replied Monte Cristo with one of those smiles which a painter will never render, and which a physiologist will always despair of analyzing.
041.044 -If I had not feared to tire Monsieur le Comte, said the general, obviously charmed by Monte Cristo's manners, I would have taken him to the Chamber; there is a curious session today for anyone who does not know our modern senators.
041.045 -- I will be very grateful to you, sir, if you will renew this offer to me another time; but today I have been flattered with the hope of being presented to the Countess, and I will wait.
041.046 --Ah! here is my mother!" cried the viscount.
041.047 Indeed, Monte Cristo, turning sharply, saw Mme. de Morcerf at the entrance of the salon, at the threshold of the door opposite that through which her husband had entered: motionless and pale, she let, when Monte Cristo turned on his side, her arm which, one does not know why, had been leaning on the gilded doorframe, fall; she had been there for a few seconds, and had heard the last words uttered by the ultramontane visitor.
041.048 This one rose and greeted deeply the countess, who bowed in her turn, mute and ceremonious.
041.049 "Eh, my God! Madam," asked the Count, "what is wrong with you? Is it by chance the heat of this salon that is hurting you?
041.050 --Are you suffering, my mother?" cried the viscount, rushing to meet Mercedes.
041.051 She thanked them both with a smile.
041.052 "No," she said, "but I felt some emotion in seeing for the first time the one without whose intervention we would be in tears and mourning at this moment. Sir," continued the countess, advancing with the majesty of a queen, "I owe you the life of my son, and for this benefit I bless you. Now I give you thanks for the pleasure you give me in giving me the opportunity to thank you as I have blessed you, that is, from the bottom of my heart."
041.053 The Count bowed again, but more deeply than the first time; he was even paler than Mercedes.
041.054 "Madam," he said, "you and Mr. Count reward me too generously for a very simple action. To save a man, to spare a father torment, to spare a woman's sensibility, is not doing a good work, it is doing an act of humanity."
041.055 To these words, pronounced with exquisite gentleness and politeness, Mme. de Morcerf replied with a deep accent:
041.056 "It is very fortunate for my son, sir, to have you for a friend, and I thank God who has made things so."
041.057 And Mercedes raised her beautiful eyes to heaven with such infinite gratitude, that the Count thought he saw two tears trembling there.
041.058 M. de Morcerf approached her.
041.059 "Madame," he said, "I have already apologized to the Count for being obliged to leave him, and you will renew them, I beg you. The session opens at two o'clock, it is three, and I must speak.
041.060 -Go, sir, I will try to make our guest forget your absence, said the countess with the same accent of sensitivity. Will the Count," she continued, turning back to Monte Cristo, "do us the honor of spending the rest of the day with us?
041.061 --Thank you, madam, and you see me, believe it or not, most grateful for your offer; but I got off this morning at your door, from my travelling car. How I am installed in Paris, I do not know; where I am, I hardly know. It is a slight worry, I know, but an appreciable one nevertheless.
041.062 --We will have this pleasure another time, at least you promise us?" asked the countess.
041.063 Monte Cristo bowed without answering, but the gesture could be taken as assent.
041.064 "Then I won't keep you, sir," said the Countess, "because I don't want my gratitude to become either an indiscretion or an importunity.
041.065 -My dear Count, said Albert, if you will, I will try to return to Paris your gracious politeness of Rome, and put my coupe at your disposal until you have had time to mount your crews.
041.066 --Thank you a thousand times for your kindness, Viscount," said Monte Cristo, "but I presume that M. Bertuccio will have suitably employed the four and a half hours I have just left him, and that I shall find some sort of carriage at the door, fully harnessed."
041.067 Albert was accustomed to these manners on the part of the count: he knew that he was, like Nero, in search of the impossible, and he was no longer surprised at anything; only he wanted to judge for himself in what way his orders had been carried out, so he accompanied him to the door of the hotel.
041.068 Monte Cristo had not been mistaken: as soon as he had appeared in the Count de Morcerf's anteroom, a footman, the same one who in Rome had come to bring the Count's card to the two young men and to announce his visit, had rushed out of the peristyle, so that on arriving at the porch the illustrious traveler found his carriage waiting for him.
041.069 It was a coupe from the workshops of Keller, and a carriage for which Drake had, to the knowledge of all the lions of Paris, refused eighteen thousand francs the day before.
041.070 "Sir," said the Count to Albert, "I do not propose to accompany you to my house, and I could only show you an improvised house, and I have, as you know, in the matter of improvisations, a reputation to spare. Give me a day and then let me invite you. I will be more sure not to break the laws of hospitality.
041.071 -If you ask me one day, Mr. Count, I am at ease, it will no longer be a house that you will show me, it will be a palace. Decidedly, you have some genius at your disposal.
041.072 --My faith, let him believe it, said Monte Cristo, putting his foot on the velvet-lined steps of his splendid crew, that will do me some good with the ladies."
041.073 And he dashed into his carriage, which closed behind him, and galloped off, but not so quickly that the Count did not notice the imperceptible movement which made the curtain of the salon where he had left Mme. de Morcerf tremble.
041.074 When Albert returned to his mother's house, he found the countess in the boudoir, plunged into a large velvet armchair: the whole room, drowned in shadow, allowed only a glimpse of the sparkling flakes attached here and there to the belly of some vase or to the corner of some golden frame.
041. 075 Albert could not see the face of the countess lost in a cloud of gauze which she had rolled around her hair like a halo of vapor; but it seemed to him that her voice was altered: he distinguished also, among the perfumes of the roses and heliotropes of the jardinière, the biting, pungent trace of vinegar salts; on one of the chiseled cups of the fireplace indeed, the countess's bottle, taken out of its sheath of sorrow, attracted the restless attention of the young man.
041.076 "Are you ill, my mother?" he cried as he entered, "and have you been ill during my absence?
041.077 --Me? not, Albert; but, you understand, these roses, these tuberoses and these orange blossoms give off such violent perfumes during these first heats, to which one is not used.
041.078 - "Then, my mother," said Morcerf, putting his hand to the bell, "you must have them carried to your anteroom. You are really indisposed; already earlier, when you entered, you were very pale.
041.079 -- I was pale, you say, Albert?
041.080 -- A pallor that suits you very well, my mother, but which did not frighten my father and me any less for that.
041.081 -- Did your father tell you about it?
041.082 -- No, ma'am, but it was to yourself, remember, that he made this observation.
041.083 --I don't remember," said the Countess.
041.084 A valet entered: he came at the sound of the bell pulled by Albert.
041.085 "Carry these flowers in the anteroom or in the toilet, said the viscount; they hurt Mrs. the countess.
041.086 The valet obeyed.
041.087 There was a rather long silence, and which lasted during all the time that the removal was made.
041.088 "What is this name of Monte Cristo?" asked the Countess when the servant had gone out carrying the last vase of flowers; "is it a family name, a land name, a simple title?
041.089 -I believe it is a title, my mother, and that is all. The Count has bought an island in the Tuscan archipelago, and has, according to what he himself said this morning, founded a commandery. You know that this is done for St. Stephen of Florence, for St. George Constantine of Parma, and even for the Order of Malta. Besides, he has no claim to nobility and calls himself a count of chance, although the general opinion in Rome is that the count is a very great lord.
041.090 --His manners are excellent, said the countess, at least as far as I could judge from the short time he has been here.
041.091 --Oh! perfect, my mother, so perfect even that they far surpass anything more aristocratic I have known in the three proudest nobilities of Europe, that is, in the English nobility, in the Spanish nobility, and in the German nobility."
041.092 The countess thought for a moment, then after this short hesitation she resumed:
041.093 "You have seen, my dear Albert, it is a mother's question that I am addressing to you there, you understand it, you have seen M. de Monte Cristo in his interior; you have insight, you are used to the world, more tact than one usually has at your age; do you believe that the Count is what he really appears to be?
041.094 --And what does he seem?
041.095 -- You said it yourself just now, a great lord.
041.096 -- I told you, my mother, that he was considered such.
041.097 -- But what do you think, Albert?
041.098 -- I don't have, I must confess, a firm opinion about him; I think he is Maltese.
041.099 -- I am not asking you about his origin; I am asking you about his person.
041.100 --Ah! about his person, that is something else; and I have seen so many strange things about him, that if you want me to tell you what I think, I will answer that I would gladly look upon him as one of Byron's men, whom misfortune has marked with a fatal seal; some Manfred, some Lara, some Werner; as one of those debris of some old family who, disinherited from their paternal fortune, have found one by the force of their adventurous genius, which has placed them above the laws of society.
041.101 -- You say?...
041.102 -- I say that Monte Cristo is an island in the middle of the Mediterranean, without inhabitants, without a garrison, a den of smugglers of all nations, of pirates of all countries. Who knows if these worthy industrialists do not pay their lord a right of asylum?
041.103 --That is possible, said the dreamy countess.
041.104 --But no matter, continued the young man, smuggler or not, you will agree, my mother, since you have seen him, the Count of Monte Cristo is a remarkable man who will have the greatest success in the salons of Paris. And look, this very morning, at my house, he began his entry into the world by striking astonishment even at Château-Renaud.
041.105 --And how old can the Count be? asked Mercédès, visibly attaching great importance to this question.
041.106 -- He is between thirty-five and thirty-six, my mother.
041.107 --So young! That's impossible, said Mercedes, responding at the same time to what Albert was telling her and to what her own thoughts were telling her.
041.108 -It is true, however. Three or four times he told me, and certainly without premeditation, at such a time I was five years old, at such a time I was ten years old, at such a time I was twelve years old; I, whom curiosity kept awake on these details, put the dates together, and never found him in default. The age of this singular man, who has no age, is thus, I am sure, thirty-five years. Besides, remember, my mother, how lively his eyes are, how black his hair is, and how his forehead, though pale, is free from wrinkles; it is a nature not only vigorous, but still young."
041.109 The countess lowered her head as if under a flood too heavy with bitter thoughts.
041.110 "And this man has taken a liking to you, Albert?" she asked with a nervous shiver.
041.111 -- I believe so, madam.
041.112 --And you... do you love him too?
041.113 --I like him, madam, whatever Franz d'Épinay says, who wanted to make him seem to me like a man returning from the other world."
041.114 The countess made a movement of terror.
041.115 "Albert," she said in an altered voice, "I have always warned you against new acquaintances. Now you are a man, and you could give me advice to myself; however, I repeat: Be careful, Albert.
041.116 --Also it would be necessary, dear mother, for the advice to be profitable to me, that I knew in advance what to be wary of. The Count never gambles, the Count only drinks water gilded with a drop of Spanish wine; the Count has announced himself so rich that, without being laughed at, he could not borrow money from me: what do you want me to fear from the Count?
041.117 --You are right, said the Countess, and my fears are foolish, having as their object especially a man who has saved your life. By the way, did your father receive him well, Albert? It is important that we should be more than decent to the Count. M. de Morcerf is sometimes busy, his business makes him anxious, and it may be that, without wishing it....
041.118 -My father was perfect, madam," interrupted Albert; "I will say more: he seemed infinitely flattered by two or three of the most adroit compliments which the count slipped to him with as much happiness as appropriateness, as if he had known him for thirty years. Each of these little praise arrows must have tickled my father," added Albert, laughing, "so that they left each other the best friends in the world, that M. de Morcerf even wanted to take him to the House to hear his speech."
041.119 The countess made no reply; she was absorbed in a reverie so deep that her eyes had gradually closed. The young man, standing before her, looked at her with that filial love more tender and affectionate in children whose mothers are young and beautiful still; then, after seeing her eyes close, he listened to her breathe for a moment in her sweet stillness, and, believing her to be drowsy, he tiptoed away, pushing cautiously at the door of the room where he left his mother.
041.120 "That devil of a man," he murmured, shaking his head, "I did predict him there that he would make a sensation in the world: I measure his effect on an infallible thermometer. My mother noticed him, so he must be quite remarkable."
041.121 And he went down to his stables, not without a secret vexation that, without having even thought of it, the Count of Monte Cristo had got hold of a carriage that sent his bais back to number 2 in the minds of connoisseurs.
041.122 "Decidedly," he said, "men are not equal; I shall have to ask my father to develop this theorem in the Upper House."
042.000 Mr. Bertuccio.
042.001 During this time the count had arrived at his house; he had taken six minutes to make the way. These six minutes had been enough for him to be seen by twenty young people who, knowing the price of the carriage which they had not been able to buy themselves, had put their mounts at a gallop to catch a glimpse of the splendid lord who gave himself horses of ten thousand francs a piece.
042.002 The house chosen by Ali, and which was to be used as residence of city to Monte-Cristo, was located on the right while going up the Champs-Élysées, placed between court and garden; a very bushy massif, which rose in the middle of the court, masked a part of the frontage, around this massif advanced, similar to two arms, two alleys which, extending to the right and to the left, brought from the grid, the cars to a double perron supporting at each step a porcelain vase full with flowers. This house, isolated in the middle of a broad space, had, in addition to the principal entry, another entry giving on the street of Ponthieu.
042.003 Even before the coachman had hailed the concierge, the massive gate rolled down on its hinges; the count had been seen coming, and in Paris as in Rome, as everywhere, he was served with the rapidity of lightning. The coachman thus entered, described the semicircle without having slowed down his pace, and the gate was already closed that the wheels still shouted on the sand of the alley.
042.004 On the left side of the stoop the carriage stopped; two men appeared at the door: one was Ali, who smiled at his master with an incredible frankness of joy, and who found himself paid by a simple glance from Monte Cristo.
042.005 The other saluted humbly and offered his arm to the Count to help him down from the carriage.
042.006 "Thank you, Mr. Bertuccio," said the Count, jumping slightly over the three steps of the footboard; "and the notary?
042.007 --He is in the small salon, Excellency," answered Bertuccio.
042.008 --And the visiting cards that I told you to have engraved as soon as you had the house number?
042.009 --Mr. Count, it is already done; I went to the best engraver of the Palais-Royal, who executed the plate in front of me; the first card drawn was carried at once, according to your order, to M. Baron Danglars, deputy, rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin, No. 7; the others are on the mantelpiece of Your Excellency's bedroom.
042.010 --Good. What time is it?
042.011 -- Four o'clock."
042.012 Monte Cristo gave his gloves, hat, and cane to the same French lackey who had rushed out of the Count de Morcerf's antechamber to call the carriage, and then he passed into the little salon led by Bertuccio, who showed him the way.
042.013 "Here are some poor marbles in this antechamber," said Monte Cristo, "I hope they will take all this away from me."
042.014 Bertuccio bowed.
042.015 As the steward had said, the notary was waiting in the small salon.
042.016 He was an honest figure of a second clerk of Paris, raised to the unassailable dignity of a suburban tabellion.
042.017 "Monsieur is the notary in charge of selling the country house I want to buy?" asked Monte Cristo.
042.018 --Yes, sir count, replied the notary.
042.019 -Is the deed of sale ready?
042.020 -- Yes, sir, Count.
042.021 -Have you brought it?
042.022 -Here it is.
042.023 --Perfectly. And where is this house that I am buying?" asked Monte Cristo carelessly, addressing himself half to Bertuccio, half to the notary.
042.024 The steward made a gesture which meant: I don't know.
042.025 The notary looked at Monte Cristo with astonishment.
042.026 "How," he said, "does monsieur le comte not know where the house he is buying is?
042.027 --No, my goodness," said the Count.
042.028 --Doesn't his Lordship know it?
042.029 --And how on earth would I know it? I arrive from Cadiz this morning, I have never been to Paris, it is even the first time that I set foot in France.
042.030 --Then it is something else, replied the notary; the house that monsieur le comte is buying is situated at Auteuil."
042.031 At these words, Bertuccio paled visibly.
042.032 "And where do you take Auteuil?" asked Monte Cristo.
042.033 --At two steps from here, Monsieur le Comte," said the notary, "a little after Passy, in a charming situation, in the middle of the Bois de Boulogne.
042.034 -So close! said Monte Cristo, but it is not the countryside. How on earth did you choose for me a house at the gate of Paris, Mr. Bertuccio?
042.035 - "Me!" exclaimed the steward with strange eagerness; "no, certainly, it is not I whom monsieur le comte has charged with choosing this house; let monsieur le comte kindly recall, search his memory, question his recollections.
042.036 --Ah, that's right, said Monte Cristo; I remember now! I read this advertisement in a newspaper, and I let myself be seduced by this lying title: "Country House.
042.037 --There is still time, said Bertuccio, and if Your Excellency wishes to instruct me to look everywhere else, I will find him the best, either at Enghien, or at Fontenay-aux-Roses, or at Bellevue.
042.038 -- "No, my goodness," said Monte Cristo carelessly; "since I have this one, I will keep it.
042.039 --And the gentleman is right, said the notary, who was afraid of losing his fees. It is a charming property: running water, thick woods, a comfortable dwelling, though abandoned for a long time; not to mention the furniture, which, however old it may be, has value, especially today when one is looking for antiques. Forgive me, but I believe that the Count has the taste of his time.
042.040 --Say always, made Monte Cristo; it is suitable, then.
042.041 --Ah! sir, it is better than that, it is magnificent!
042.042 --Peace! let us not miss such an opportunity, said Monte Cristo; the contract, please, Mr. Notary?"
042.043 And he signed quickly, after having glanced at the place in the deed where the situation of the house and the names of the owners were designated.
042.044 "Bertuccio," he said, "give the gentleman fifty-five thousand francs."
042.045 The steward went out with an insecure step, and returned with a bundle of banknotes which the notary counted as a man who is accustomed to receiving his money only after the legal purge.
042.046 "And now," asked the Count, "are all the formalities completed?
042.047 --All of them, Count.
042.048 --Do you have the keys?
042.049 --They are in the hands of the janitor who guards the house; but here is the order I gave him to install the gentleman in his property.
042.050 --Fine."
042.051 And Monte Cristo gave the notary a nod that meant:
042.052 "I have no more need of you, go away."
042.053 "But," ventured the honest tabellion, "Monsieur le Comte is mistaken, it seems to me; it is only fifty thousand francs, all included.
042.054 --And your fees?
042.055 --They are paid for that sum, sir.
042.056 --But didn't you come here from Auteuil?
042.057 -- Yes, no doubt.
042.058 --Well, we must pay you for your trouble," said the Count.
042.059 And he dismissed him with a gesture.
042.060 The notary went out backwards and bowed to the ground; it was the first time, since the day he had taken his inscriptions, that he met such a client.
042.061 "Lead on, sir," said the Count to Bertuccio.
042.062 And the steward went out behind the notary.
042.063 As soon as the Count was alone, he took out of his pocket a wallet with a lock, which he opened with a small key attached to his neck and which never left him.
042.064 After searching for a moment, he stopped at a sheet of paper that bore some notes, confronted these notes with the bill of sale laid on the table, and, gathering his memories:
042.065 "Auteuil, rue de la Fontaine, No. 28; that's right," he said; "now must I rely on a confession wrung from me by religious terror or by physical terror? Besides, in an hour I shall know everything. Bertuccio!" he cried, striking with a sort of small hammer with a folding handle on a gong that made a high, prolonged sound like that of a tom-tom, "Bertuccio!
042.066 The intendant appeared on the threshold.
042.067 "Mr. Bertuccio," said the Count, "didn't you tell me once that you had traveled to France?
042.068 --In certain parts of France, yes, Excellency.
042.069 --You know the area around Paris, no doubt?
042.070 --No, Excellency, no," replied the steward with a sort of nervous trembling which Monte Cristo, a connoisseur of emotions, rightly attributed to a deep anxiety.
042.071 -- It is unfortunate, he said, that you have never visited the environs of Paris, for I want to go this very evening to see my new property, and by coming with me you would undoubtedly have given me useful information.
042.072 --To Auteuil? exclaimed Bertuccio, whose copper complexion became almost livid. Me, to go to Auteuil!
042.073 --Well, what's so surprising about your coming to Auteuil, I ask you? When I live in Auteuil, you will have to come there, since you are part of the house."
042.074 Bertuccio lowered his head before the imperious gaze of the master, and he remained motionless and without answer.
042.075 "Oh, what's the matter with you? Are you going to make me ring for the carriage a second time?" said Monte Cristo in the tone that Louis XIV used to pronounce the famous: "I almost waited!"
042.076 Bertuccio made but a leap from the little salon to the anteroom, and shouted in a hoarse voice:
042.077 "His Excellency's horses!"
042.078 Monte Cristo wrote two or three letters; as he was sealing the last one, the steward appeared again.
042.079 "His Excellency's carriage is at the door," he said.
042.080 --Well, take your gloves and hat, said Monte Cristo.
042.081 --Am I going with Monsieur le Comte?" cried Bertuccio.
042.082 -- No doubt you must give your orders, since I intend to live in this house."
042.083 It was without example that an injunction from the count had been replied to; so the steward, without making any objection, followed his master, who got into the carriage and beckoned him to follow. The steward sat respectfully on the front seat.
043.000 The house of Auteuil.
043.001 Monte-Cristo had noticed that while descending the staircase, Bertuccio had signed himself in the Corsican manner, that is to say by cutting the air in the form of a cross with his thumb, and that while taking his place in the carriage he had mumbled a short prayer. Any other than a curious man would have pitied the singular repugnance manifested by the worthy steward for the walk meditated _extra muros_ by the count; but, as it seems, the latter was too curious to dispense Bertuccio from this little journey.
043.002 In twenty minutes we were at Auteuil. The emotion of the steward had been always increasing. While entering the village, Bertuccio, reclining in the corner of the car, began to examine with a feverish emotion each house in front of which one passed.
043.003 "You will make stop street of the Fountain, to the n° 28", said the count while fixing his glance mercilessly on the steward, to whom he gave this order.
043.004 The sweat rose to Bertuccio's face; however, he obeyed, and, leaning out of the carriage, he shouted to the coachman:
043.005 "Rue de la Fontaine, No. 28."
043.006 This No. 28 was located at the end of the village. During the journey, the night had come, or rather a black cloud all charged with electricity gave to these premature darknesses the appearance and the solemnity of a dramatic episode.
043.007 The car stopped and the footman rushed to the door, which he opened.
043.008 "Well," said the Count, "aren't you getting out, Mr. Bertuccio? But what on earth are you thinking about tonight?"
043.009 Bertuccio rushed through the door and presented his shoulder to the Count, who this time leaned on it and descended one by one the three steps of the footboard.
043.010 "Knock," said the Count, "and announce me."
043.011 Bertuccio knocked, the door opened and the janitor appeared.
043.012 "What is it?" he asked.
043.013 --This is your new master, good man," said the footman.
043.014 And he handed the janitor the bill of recognition given by the notary.
043.015 "So the house is sold?" asked the janitor, "and it's this gentleman who's coming to live in it?
043.016 --Yes, my friend," said the Count, "and I will try not to make you miss your former master.
043.017 -- "Oh, sir," said the janitor, "I will not have to miss him very much, for we seldom see him; it is more than five years since he came, and he has, my goodness, done well to sell a house that brought him absolutely nothing.
043.018 --And what was the name of your former master?
043.019 --Mr. Marquis de Saint-Méran; ah! he did not sell the house for what it cost him, I am sure.
043.020 --The Marquis of Saint-Méran!" said Monte Cristo; "but it seems to me that this name is not unknown to me," said the Count; "the Marquis of Saint-Méran....
043.021 And he seemed to be looking.
043.022 "An old gentleman," continued the concierge, "a faithful servant of the Bourbons; he had an only daughter whom he had married to M. de Villefort, who was prosecutor to the king at Nimes and then at Versailles."
043.023 Monte Cristo cast a glance that met Bertuccio more livid than the wall against which he leaned to keep from falling.
043.024 "And isn't that girl dead?" asked Monte Cristo; it seems to me that I have heard that.
043.025 --Yes, sir, twenty-one years ago, and since that time we have not seen the poor dear Marquis three times.
043.026 --Thank you, thank you," said Monte Cristo, judging from the prostration of the steward that he could not stretch the rope any further without risking breaking it. Give me some light, good man.
043.027 --Shall I accompany the gentleman?
043.028 --No, it is useless, Bertuccio will enlighten me.
043.029 And Monte Cristo accompanied these words with the gift of two gold coins which raised an explosion of blessings and sighs.
043.030 "Ah, sir!" said the janitor, after having searched in vain on the ledge of the fireplace and on the adjoining boards, "I have no candles here.
043.031 --Take one of the lanterns of the car, Bertuccio, and show me the apartments", said the count.
043.032 The steward obeyed without comment, but it was easy to see, by the trembling of the hand that held the lantern, what it cost him to obey.
043.033 One traversed a rather vast first floor; a second floor composed of a living room, a bathroom and two bedrooms. By one of these bedrooms, one arrived at a turning staircase whose end led to the garden.
043.034 "Well, here is a staircase of release, says the count, it is rather convenient. Light me, Mr. Bertuccio; pass in front of it, and let us go where this staircase will lead us.
043.035 --Sir, said Bertuccio, it goes to the garden.
043.036 --And how do you know that, I pray you?
043.037 --That is to say, he must go there.
043.038 --Well, let's make sure."
043.039 Bertuccio heaved a sigh and walked ahead. The staircase did indeed lead to the garden.
043.040 At the outer door the intendant stopped.
043.041 "Come on, Mr. Bertuccio!" said the Count.
043.042 But the one he was addressing was stunned, stupid, annihilated. His stray eyes were searching all around him as if for traces of a terrible past, and with his clenched hands he seemed to be trying to push away terrible memories.
043.043 "Well?" insisted the Count.
043.044 --No! no!" cried Bertuccio, placing his hand on the corner of the inner wall; "no, sir, I will go no further, it is impossible!
043.045 --What is this to say?" articulated the irresistible voice of Monte Cristo.
043.046 --But you see, sir," cried the intendant, "that this is not natural; that having a house to buy in Paris, you should buy it in Auteuil, and that buying it in Auteuil, this house should be No. 28 of the Rue de la Fontaine! Ah! why didn't I tell you everything there, my lord. You certainly would not have demanded that I come. I hoped that the house of monsieur le comte would be another house than this one. As if there were no other house in Auteuil than the one where the murder took place!
043.047 --Oh! oh!" said Monte Cristo, stopping suddenly, "what an ugly word you have just uttered! Devil of a man! Rooted Corsican! always mysteries or superstitions! Let's see, take this lantern and visit the garden; with me you won't be afraid, I hope!"
043.048 Bertuccio picked up the lantern and obeyed.
043.049 The door, on opening, revealed a pallid sky in which the moon strove in vain to fight against a sea of clouds that covered it with their dark waves, which it illuminated for a moment, and which then went to lose themselves, darker still, in the depths of infinity.
043.050 The steward wanted to press the left.
043.051 "Not so, sir," said Monte Cristo, "what is the use of following the paths?
043.052 Bertuccio wiped the sweat from his forehead, but obeyed; however, he continued to take the left. Monte-Cristo, on the contrary, pressed to the right. Arrived near a mass of trees, he stopped.
043.053 The steward could not stand it.
043.054 "Get away, sir!" he cried, "get away, I beg you, you're right in the place!
043.055 -- In what place?
043.056 -- In the very place where he fell.
043.057 --My dear Mr. Bertuccio, said Monte-Cristo laughing, come back to you, I urge you; we are not here in Sartene or in Corte. This is not a maquis, but an English garden, badly maintained, I agree, but which one should not slander for that.
043.058 --Sir, don't stay there! Don't stay there! I beg you.
043.059 --I think you are going mad, Master Bertuccio," said the Count coldly; "if that is the case, let me know, for I will have you locked up in some nursing home before something happens.
043.060 -- "Alas, Your Excellency," said Bertuccio, shaking his head and joining his hands with an attitude that would have made the Count laugh, if thoughts of a higher interest had not captivated him at that moment and made him very attentive to the slightest outbursts of this timorous conscience. Alas, Your Excellency, the misfortune has arrived.
043.061 --Mr. Bertuccio, said the Count, I am very pleased to tell you that, while gesticulating, you are twisting your arms and rolling your eyes like a man possessed of a body from which the devil does not want to leave; but I have almost always noticed that the devil who is the most stubborn to stay at his post is a secret. I knew you were Corsican, I knew you were gloomy and always brooding over some old story of vendetta, and I was passing this on to you in Italy, because in Italy these sorts of things are the order of the day, but in France one generally finds assassination in very bad taste: there are gendarmes who deal with it, judges who condemn it, and scaffolds who avenge it."
043.062 Bertuccio joined his hands and, as he executed these different evolutions without leaving his lantern, the light illuminated his upset face.
043.063 Monte Cristo examined him with the same eye that in Rome he had examined Andrea's torture; then, in a tone of voice that sent a new shiver through the poor steward's body, he said
043.064 "So the Abbot Busoni had lied to me," he said, "when, after his trip to France in 1829, he sent you to me with a letter of recommendation in which he commended your valuable qualities. Well, I will write to the abbot; I will make him responsible for his protégé, and I will know without a doubt what this whole murder business is. Only, I warn you, Mr. Bertuccio, that when I live in a country, I am used to conforming to its laws, and that I have no desire to quarrel for you with the justice of France.
043.065 --Oh, don't do that, Excellency, I have served you faithfully, haven't I?" cried Bertuccio in despair, "I have always been an honest man, and I have even done good deeds as much as I could.
043.066 --I don't say no," said the Count, "but why on earth are you so agitated? It is a bad sign: a pure conscience does not bring so much paleness to the cheeks, so much fever to the hands of a man....
043.067 --But, sir count," Bertuccio continued hesitating, "didn't you tell me yourself that M. l'abbé Busoni, who heard my confession in the prisons of Nîmes, had warned you, when he sent me to you, that I had a heavy reproach to make?
043.068 --Yes, but as he addressed you to me, telling me that you would make an excellent steward, I thought you had stolen, that's all!
043.069 --Oh! sir count!" said Bertuccio contemptuously.
043.070 -- Or that, as you were a Corsican, you could not resist the desire to make a skin, as we say in the country by antiphrase, when on the contrary one is undone.
043.071 -- Well, yes, my lord, yes, my good lord, that's it! exclaimed Bertuccio, throwing himself at the count's knees; yes, it's a revenge, I swear, a simple revenge.
043.072 --I understand, but what I don't understand is that it is this very house that has galvanized you to this point.
043.073 --But, my lord, isn't it natural," Bertuccio continued, "since it was in this house that the revenge was carried out?
043.074 -- What! my house!
043.075 -- "Oh, my lord, it was not yet yours," replied Bertuccio, naively.
043.076 --But whose house was it? "The Marquis of Saint-Méran's," said the janitor, I believe. What on earth did you have to avenge yourself on the Marquis of Saint-Méran?
043.077 -- Oh, it was not from him, my lord, it was from someone else.
043.078 -- "It is a strange meeting," said Monte Cristo, seeming to give way to his reflections, "that you should find yourself like this by chance, without any preparation whatsoever, in a house where a scene has taken place which gives you such terrible remorse.
043. 079 --Monseigneur, said the intendant, it is fatality which brings all that, I am quite sure of it: first, you buy a house just in Auteuil, this house is the one where I committed an assassination; you go down to the garden just by the staircase where he went down; you stop just at the place where he received the blow; two steps away, under this plane tree, was the pit where he had just buried the child: all this is not chance, no, for in this case chance would look too much like Providence.
043.080 --Well, let us see, Monsieur le Corse, let us suppose that it was Providence; I always suppose anything one wants; besides, to sick minds one must make concessions. Let us see, call back your spirits and tell me about it.
043.081 -- I have only ever told it once, and that was to the Abbé Busoni. Such things," added Bertuccio, shaking his head, "can only be said under the seal of confession.
043.082 - "Then, my dear Bertuccio," said the Count, "you will find it good that I send you back to your confessor; you will make yourself a Carthusian or a Bernardine with him, and you will talk about your secrets. But I am afraid of a guest frightened by such ghosts; I do not like my people not to dare to walk in my garden at night. Then, I confess, I would not be very curious of some visit of police commissioner; because, learn this, Master Bertuccio: in Italy, one pays the justice only if it is silent, but in France one pays it on the contrary only when it speaks. Pest! I thought you were a bit of a Corsican, a lot of a smuggler, and a very good steward, but I see that you still have other strings to your bow. You are no longer mine, Mr. Bertuccio.
043.083 --Oh! my lord! my lord!" cried the steward, struck with terror at this threat; "oh! if it is only for that that I remain in your service, I will speak, I will say everything; and if I leave you, well, then it will be to walk to the scaffold.
043.084 --That's different then, said Monte Cristo; but if you want to lie, think about it: it's better that you don't speak at all.
043.085 -- No, sir, I swear to you on the salvation of my soul, I will tell you everything! for Abbot Busoni himself knew only part of my secret. But first, I beg you, get away from this plane tree; here, the moon will whiten this cloud, and there, placed as you are, wrapped in this cloak which hides your waist from me and which resembles that of M. de Villefort!...
043.086 --How!" exclaimed Monte Cristo, "it is M. de Villefort! ....
043.087 -- Your Excellency knows him?
043.088 --The former king's prosecutor of Nîmes?
043.089 --Yes.
043.090 --Who had married the daughter of the Marquis of Saint-Méran?
043.091 --Yes.
043.092 --And who had the reputation in the bar of being the most honest, the most severe, the most rigid magistrate.
043.093 --Well, sir," exclaimed Bertuccio, "this man with an impeccable reputation....
043.094 --Yes.
043.095 --He was a villain.
043.096 --Bah! said Monte Cristo, impossible.
043.097 --That is however as I tell you.
043.098 --Ah, really!" said Monte Cristo, "and you have proof of this?
043.099 -- I had it at least.
043.100 --And you have lost it, you clumsy fool?
043.101 -- Yes; but by looking well one can find it.
043.102 -- Truly!" said the Count, "tell me about it, Mr. Bertuccio, because it really begins to interest me."
043.103 And the Count, singing a little air from the _Lucia_, went and sat down on a bench, while Bertuccio followed him, recalling his memories.
043.104 Bertuccio remained standing before him.
044.000 The vendetta.
044.001 "Where does the Count want me to take things from?" asked Bertuccio.
044.002 --But from wherever you want, said Monte Cristo, since I know absolutely nothing.
044.003 --I thought, however, that the Abbot Busoni had told Your Excellency....
044.004 -- Yes, some details no doubt, but seven or eight years have passed on that, and I have forgotten all that.
044.005 --So I can, without fear of annoying Your Excellency....
044.006 --Come on, Mr. Bertuccio, come on, you will be my evening paper.
044.007 --Things go back to 1815.
044.008 --Ah! ah! made Monte-Cristo, it is not yesterday, 1815.
044.009 -- No, sir, and yet the smallest details are as present in my memory as if we were only in the morning. I had a brother, an older brother, who was in the service of the emperor. He had become lieutenant in a regiment composed entirely of Corsicans. This brother was my only friend; we had remained orphans, I at five years old, he at eighteen, he had raised me as if I had been his son. In 1814, under the Bourbons, he had married; the Emperor returned from the island of Elba, my brother took again at once service, and, slightly wounded at Waterloo, he withdrew with the army behind the Loire.
044.010 --But it is the history of the Hundred Days that you make me there, Mr. Bertuccio, said the count, and it is already made, if I am not mistaken.
044.011 --Excuse me, Excellency, but these first details are necessary, and you promised me to be patient.
044.012 --Come on! come on! I have only one word.
044.013 --One day, we received a letter, it is necessary to say to you that we lived in the small village of Rogliano, at the end of the Cape of Corsica: this letter was from my brother; he said to us that the army was dismissed and that he was returning by Châteauroux, Clermont-Ferrand, the Puy and Nimes; if I had some money, he asked me to make him hold it in Nimes, at an innkeeper of our acquaintance, with whom I was in contact.
044.014 --Smuggled," said Monte Cristo.
044.015 -- Oh, my God! Mr. Count, it is necessary.
044.016 --Certainly, go on.
044.017 -- I loved my brother dearly, I told you, Excellency; so I resolved not to send him the money, but to take it to him myself. I had a thousand francs, I left five hundred of them with Assunta, my sister-in-law; I took the other five hundred, and set out for Nîmes. It was an easy thing, I had my boat, a load to be made at sea; all supported my project. But the loading made, the wind became contrary, so that we were four or five days without being able to enter the Rhone. Finally we managed to do so; we went up to Arles; I left the boat between Bellegarde and Beaucaire, and I took the road to Nîmes.
044.018 -- We're coming, aren't we?
044.019 -- Yes, sir: excuse me, but, as Your Excellency will see, I only tell him the things that are absolutely necessary. Now, it was the moment when the famous massacres of the Midi were taking place. There were two or three brigands there called Trestaillon, Truphemy and Graffan, who were slitting the throats in the streets of all those suspected of Bonapartism. Without doubt, Monsieur le Comte has heard of these assassinations?
044.020 -- Vaguely, I was very far from France at that time. Continue.
044.021 --When entering Nîmes, one literally walked in blood; at every step one encountered corpses: the assassins, organized in bands, killed, pillaged and burned.
044.022 "At the sight of this carnage, a shiver took hold of me, not for myself; I, a simple Corsican fisherman, had little to fear; on the contrary, that time was our good time, for us smugglers, but for my brother, for my brother, a soldier of the Empire, returning from the army of the Loire with his uniform and his epaulets, and who, therefore, had everything to fear.
044.023 "I ran to our innkeeper. My presentiments had not deceived me: my brother had arrived the day before in Nîmes, and at the very door of the one to whom he had come to ask for hospitality, he had been murdered.
044.024 "I did everything in the world to find out who the murderers were; but no one dared to tell me their names, so much were they feared. I thought then of that French justice, of which I had been told so much, which fears nothing, and I presented myself to the king's prosecutor.
044.025 --And this king's prosecutor was named Villefort? asked Monte Cristo carelessly.
044.026 -- Yes, Excellency: he came from Marseilles, where he had been a substitute. His zeal had earned him promotion. He was one of the first, it was said, who had announced to the government the landing of the island of Elba.
044.027 - "So," said Monte Cristo, "you went to his house.
044.028 "-Sir," I said to him, "my brother was murdered yesterday in the streets of Nîmes, I do not know by whom, but it is your mission to know. You are here chief of justice, and it is for justice to avenge those whom it did not know how to defend.
044.029 "--And what was your brother?" asked the king's prosecutor ....
044.030 "--Lieutenant in the Corsican battalion.
044.031 "--A soldier of the usurper, then?
044.032 "--A soldier of the French armies.
044.033 "--Well," he replied, "he used himself and perished by the sword.
044.034 "--You are mistaken, sir; he perished by the dagger.
044.035 "--What do you want me to do about it?" replied the magistrate.
044.036 "--But I told you: I want you to avenge him.
044.037 "--And from whom?
044.038 "--From his murderers.
044.039 "--Do I know them?
044.040 "--Have them searched.
044.041 "--For what? Your brother will have had some quarrel and fought a duel. All these former soldiers are prone to excesses which were successful for them under the Empire, but which turn out badly for them now; and our people of the South like neither soldiers nor excesses.
044.042 "--Monsieur," I resumed, "it is not for me that I beg you. I will cry or I will take revenge, that is all; but my poor brother had a wife. If it happened to me, this poor creature would die of hunger, because the work of my brother alone made her live. Get her a small pension from the government.
044.043 "-Every revolution has its disasters," replied M. de Villefort; "your brother was a victim of this one, that is a misfortune, and the government owes your family nothing for it. If we had to judge all the vengeance which the partisans of the usurper have exercised on the partisans of the king when in their turn they had the power, your brother would perhaps be condemned to death today. What is accomplished is a natural thing, because it is the law of reprisals.
044.044 "--How, sir," I cried, "it is possible that you, a magistrate, should speak to me in this way...
044.045 "--All these Corsicans are mad, my word of honor!" replied M. de Villefort, "and they still believe that their compatriot is emperor. You are in the wrong time, my dear; you should have come to tell me that two months ago. Today it is too late; go away, and if you do not go away, I will have you escorted back.
044.046 "I looked at him for a moment to see if by a new supplication there was something to hope for. This man was of stone. I approached him:
044.047 "--Well, I said to him in a half-voice, since you know the Corsicans, you must know how they keep their word. You find that it was well done to kill my brother who was a Bonapartist, because you are a royalist; well, I, who am also a Bonapartist, declare one thing to you: that I will kill you. From this moment I declare the vendetta; so, hold on tight, and guard yourself as best you can, because the first time we find ourselves face to face, your last hour will have come.
044.048 "And with that, before he had recovered from his surprise, I opened the door and fled.
044.049 - "Ah! ah!" said Monte Cristo, "with your honest face, you do such things, Monsieur Bertuccio, and to a royal prosecutor, too! I am not sure that he knew what the word "vendetta" meant.
044.050 -- He knew it so well that from that moment on he did not go out alone and shut himself up at home, making me look for him everywhere. Fortunately I was so well hidden that he could not find me. Then fear took him, he trembled to remain any longer in Nîmes; he asked for a change of residence, and, as he was indeed an influential man, he was appointed to Versailles; but, you know, there is no distance for a Corsican who has sworn to take revenge on his enemy, and his car, however well conducted it was, never had more than half a day's head start on me, who nevertheless followed it on foot.
044.051 "The important thing was not to kill him, a hundred times I had found the opportunity; but it was necessary to kill him without being discovered and especially without being arrested. From now on I no longer belonged to myself: I had to protect and feed my sister-in-law. For three months I watched M. de Villefort; for three months he did not take a step, a walk, a stroll, that my eyes did not follow him wherever he went. At last I discovered that he was coming mysteriously to Auteuil: I followed him again and saw him enter this house where we are, only, instead of entering like everyone else by the big door of the street, he came either on horseback or in a carriage, left the carriage or the horse at the inn, and entered by this little door which you see there."
044.052 Monte Cristo nodded, proving that in the midst of the darkness he could indeed make out the entrance indicated by Bertuccio.
044.053 "I no longer needed to stay in Versailles, I settled in Auteuil and asked around. If I wanted to catch him, it was obviously there that I had to set my trap.
044.054 "The house belonged, as the concierge told Your Excellency, to M. de Saint-Méran, Villefort's father-in-law. M. de Saint-Méran lived in Marseilles; consequently, this countryside was useless to him; so it was said that he had just rented it to a young widow who was known only as the Baroness.
044.055 "Indeed, one evening, looking over the wall, I saw a young and beautiful woman walking alone in this garden, which no foreign window overlooked; she frequently looked out the little door, and I understood that that evening she was waiting for M. de Villefort. When she was close enough to me so that in spite of the darkness I could distinguish her features, I saw a beautiful young woman of eighteen or nineteen, tall and blonde. As she was wearing a simple bathrobe and nothing was in the way of her waist, I could see that she was pregnant and that her pregnancy even seemed to be advanced.
044.056 "A few moments later, the little door was opened; a man entered; the young woman ran as fast as she could to meet him, they threw themselves into each other's arms, embraced each other tenderly and returned to the house together.
044.057 "This man was M. de Villefort. I judged that when he went out, especially if he went out at night, he should cross the entire length of the garden alone.
044.058 --And," asked the Count, "have you since known the name of this woman?
044.059 -- No, Excellency," replied Bertuccio; "you will see that I did not have time to learn it.
044.060 --Continue.
044.061 --That evening, Bertuccio continued, I could have killed the King's prosecutor, perhaps; but I did not yet know enough about the garden in all its details. I feared not to kill him stiffly, and, if someone ran to his cries, not to be able to flee. I postponed the game until the next meeting, and, so that nothing escaped me, I took a small room overlooking the street along which the garden wall ran.
044.062 "Three days later, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw a servant on horseback leave the house and gallop down the road to Sevres; I assumed that he was going to Versailles. I was not mistaken. Three hours later, the man returned all covered with dust; his message was finished.
044.063 "Ten minutes later, another man on foot, wrapped in a cloak, opened the small garden gate, which closed on him.
044.064 "I went down quickly. Although I had not seen Villefort's face, I recognized him by the beating of my heart: I crossed the street, I reached a post placed at the corner of the wall and by means of which I had looked into the garden the first time.
044.065 "This time I did not content myself with looking, I drew my knife from my pocket, made sure that the point was sharp, and jumped over the wall.
044.066 "My first care was to run to the door; he had left the key inside, taking the simple precaution of giving the lock a double turn.
044.067 Nothing thus hindered my escape on that side. I started to study the localities. The garden formed a long square, a lawn of fine English grass extended in the middle, at the corners of this lawn were clumps of trees with bushy foliage and all intermingled with autumn flowers.
044.068 "To get from the house to the little door, or from the little door to the house, whether he was entering or leaving, M. de Villefort was obliged to pass near one of these clumps.
044.069 "It was the end of September; the wind was blowing strongly; a little pale moon, veiled every moment by large clouds that slipped rapidly across the sky, whitened the sand of the paths that led to the house, but could not pierce the darkness of these bushy clumps in which a man could remain hidden without fear of being seen.
044.070 "I hid in the one nearest to which Villefort was to pass; hardly had I reached it, when, amidst the puffs of wind which curved the trees above my forehead, I thought I could distinguish as if moaning. But you know, or rather you do not know, Monsieur le Comte, that he who waits for the moment to commit an assassination always thinks he hears muffled cries in the air. Two hours passed, during which time I thought I heard the same moans several times. Midnight sounded.
044.071 "As the last sound still vibrated mournfully and resoundingly, I saw a glow illuminating the windows of the hidden staircase by which we descended earlier.
044.072 "The door opened, and the man with the coat appeared again. It was the terrible moment; but for so long I had been preparing myself for this moment that nothing in me faltered: I drew my knife, opened it and stood ready.
044.073 "The man in the cloak came straight to me, but as he advanced into the open space, I thought I noticed that he was holding a weapon in his right hand: I was afraid, not of a struggle, but of failure. When he was only a few steps away from me, I recognized that what I had taken for a weapon was nothing other than a spade.
044.074 "I had not yet been able to guess for what purpose M. de Villefort was holding a spade in his hand, when he stopped on the edge of the massif, glanced around, and began to dig a hole in the earth. It was then that I noticed that there was something in his coat, which he had just put down on the lawn to be freer of his movements.
044.075 "Then, I confess, a little curiosity crept into my hatred: I wanted to see what Villefort was doing there; I remained motionless, without breath, I waited.
044.076 "Then an idea came to me, which was confirmed when I saw the king's prosecutor pull from his coat a small chest two feet long and six or eight inches wide.
044.077 "I let him place the chest in the hole, over which he pushed back the earth; then, on this fresh earth, he pressed his feet to remove the trace of the nocturnal work. I then sprang upon him and thrust my knife into his chest, saying:
044.078 "--I am Giovanni Bertuccio! your death for my brother, your treasure for his widow: you see that my revenge is more complete than I had hoped.
044.079 "I don't know if he heard these words; I don't think so, for he fell without uttering a cry; I felt the streams of his blood gushing hotly over my hands and face; but I was drunk, I was delirious; this blood refreshed me instead of burning me. In a second I had dug up the box with the spade; then, so that no one would see that I had removed it, I filled in the hole, I threw the spade over the wall, I dashed through the door, which I double-locked outside and took the key with me.
044.080 - "Good!" said Monte Cristo, "as far as I can see, it was a small assassination doubled by theft.
044.081 -- No, Excellency," replied Bertuccio, "it was a vendetta followed by restitution.
044.082 --And the sum was round, at least?
044.083 --It was not money.
044.084 --Ah, yes, I remember, said Monte Cristo, did you not speak of a child?
044.085 -- Just so, Excellency. I ran to the river, sat down on the embankment, and, in a hurry to find out what was in the chest, I broke the lock with my knife.
044.086 "In a swaddling cloth of fine batiste was wrapped a child who had just been born; its empurpled face, its purple hands announced that it must have succumbed to an asphyxia caused by natural ligaments rolled around its neck; however, as it was not yet cold, I hesitated to throw it into this water which flowed at my feet. Indeed, after a moment I thought I felt a slight fluttering towards the region of his heart; I freed his neck from the cord that enveloped it, and, as I had been a nurse at the hospital in Bastia, I did what a doctor could have done in such circumstances, that is to say, I courageously breathed air into his lungs, that after a quarter of an hour of unheard-of efforts I saw him breathe, and I heard a cry escape from his chest.
044.087 "In my turn, I gave a cry, but a cry of joy. God does not curse me, I said to myself, since he allows me to give life to one human creature in exchange for the life I have taken from another!
044.088 -- And what did you do with this child?" asked Monte Cristo; "it was rather embarrassing baggage for a man who needed to flee.
044.089 -So I did not for a moment have the idea of keeping it. But I knew that there was a hospice in Paris where these poor creatures were received. While passing at the barrier, I declared to have found this child on the road and I informed myself. The trunk was there as proof; the batiste swaddling clothes indicated that the child belonged to rich parents; the blood I was covered with could as well belong to the child as to any other individual. I was not objected to; I was shown the hospice, which was situated at the very end of the rue d'Enfer, and, after having taken the precaution of cutting the diaper in two, so that one of the two letters which marked it continued to envelop the body of the child, I deposited my burden in the tower, rang the bell and fled with all my legs. Fifteen days later, I was back in Rogliano, and I said to Assunta:
044.090 "--Console yourself, sister; Israel is dead, but I have avenged him.
044.091 "Then she asked me for an explanation of these words, and I told her everything that had happened.
044.092 "--Giovanni," said Assunta to me, "you should have brought that child back, we would have taken the place of the parents he lost, we would have called him Benedetto, and for this good deed God would have blessed us indeed.
044.093 "For all answer I gave him the half of the diaper I had kept, so that if we were richer we could claim the child.
044.094 --And what letters were on this diaper?" asked Monte Cristo.
044.095 -- An H and an N surmounted by a baron's tortil.
044.096 -- I believe, God forgive me, that you are using terms of arms, Mr. Bertuccio! Where on earth did you make your heraldic studies?
044.097 -- At your service, sir count, where one learns all things.
044.098 --Continue, I am curious to know two things.
044.099 --What are they, my lord?
044.100 --What became of this little boy; didn't you tell me he was a little boy, Mr. Bertuccio?
044.101 -- No, Excellency; I don't remember talking about that.
044.102 --Ah! I thought I had heard, I was mistaken.
044.103 -- No, you were not mistaken, for it was indeed a little boy; but Your Excellency wanted to know two things: what was the second?
044.104 --The second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for a confessor, and the Abbé Busoni went to find you on this request in the prison of Nimes.
044.105 --Perhaps this account will be very long, Excellency.
044.106 --What does it matter? It is barely ten o'clock, you know that I am not asleep, and I suppose that on your side you do not have much desire to sleep."
044.107 Bertuccio bowed and resumed his narration.
044.108 "Half to chase away the memories that besieged me, half to provide for the poor widow, I returned with eagerness to this trade of smuggling, which has become easier by the relaxation of laws that always follows revolutions. The coasts of the South, especially, were badly guarded, because of the eternal riots which took place, sometimes in Avignon, sometimes in Nimes, sometimes in Uzes. We took advantage of this sort of truce granted to us by the government to establish relations with the entire coastline. Since the murder of my brother in the streets of Nîmes, I had not wanted to return to this city. As a result, the innkeeper with whom we were doing business, seeing that we no longer wanted to come to him, came to us and founded a branch of his inn on the road from Bellegarde to Beaucaire, under the sign of the _Pont du Gard_. We had thus, either on the side of Aigues-Mortes, or in Martigues, or in Bouc, a dozen warehouses where we deposited our goods and where, if necessary, we found a refuge against the customs officers and the gendarmes. As for me, I lived in the mountains having now a double reason to fear gendarmes and customs officers, since any appearance before the judges could lead to an investigation, that this investigation is always an excursion in the past, and that in my past, to me, one could meet now something more serious than cigars smuggled or barrels of brandy circulating without a pass. Also, preferring a thousand times death to an arrest, I accomplished astonishing things, and which, more than once, gave me this proof, that the too great care which we take of our body is almost the only obstacle to the success of those of our projects which need a fast decision and a vigorous and determined execution. Indeed, once one has made the sacrifice of one's life, one is no longer the equal of other men, or rather other men are no longer your equals, and whoever has made this resolution feels, at the very moment, a tenfold increase in his strength and a widening of his horizon.
044.109 --Philosophy, Mr. Bertuccio! interrupted the Count; but you have done a little of everything in your life?
044.110 --Oh! pardon me, Excellency!
044.111 -- No! no! it is that philosophy at half past ten in the evening is a little late. But I have no other observation to make, since I find it exact, which cannot be said of all philosophies.
044.112 --My errands thus became more and more extensive, more and more fruitful. Assunta was a housewife, and our small fortune was growing. One day I was leaving for an errand:
044.113 "--Go," she said, "and when you return I will give you a surprise.
044.114 "I questioned her uselessly: she did not want to tell me anything and I left.
044.115 "The voyage lasted nearly six weeks; we had gone to Lucca to load oil, and to Livorno to take English cottons; our disembarkation took place without any adverse event, we made our profits and returned all joyful.
044.116 "On entering the house, the first thing I saw in the most conspicuous part of Assunta's room, in a cradle that was sumptuous in comparison with the rest of the apartment, was a child of seven or eight months. I shouted with joy. The only moments of sadness I had experienced since the assassination of the King's prosecutor had been caused by the abandonment of this child. It goes without saying that I had no remorse for the murder itself.
044.117 "Poor Assunta had guessed everything: she had taken advantage of my absence, and, armed with half of the diaper, having written down, so as not to forget it, the precise day and hour when the child had been deposited at the hospice, she had left for Paris and had gone herself to claim it. No objections were made to her, and the child was given to her.
044.118 "Ah, I confess, sir count, that when I saw this poor creature sleeping in his cradle, my chest swelled and tears came from my eyes.
044.119 "--In truth, Assunta," I cried, "you are a worthy woman, and Providence will bless you.
044.120 --This, said Monte Cristo, is less exact than your philosophy; it is true that it is only faith.
044.121 -- Alas, Excellency," continued Bertuccio, "you are quite right, and it was this child himself whom God charged with my punishment. Never was a more perverse nature declared more prematurely, and yet it cannot be said that he was badly brought up, for my sister treated him as the son of a prince; he was a boy of charming figure, with eyes of a clear blue like those Chinese earthenware tones which harmonize so well with the milky white of the general tone; only his hair of a too lively blondness gave to his figure a strange character, which doubled the vivacity of his glance and the malice of his smile. Unfortunately there is a proverb which says that the redhead is all good or all bad; the proverb did not lie for Benedetto, and from his youth he showed himself all bad. It is also true that his mother's gentleness encouraged his early inclinations; the child, for whom my poor sister went to the market in the town, four or five leagues away, to buy the first fruits and the most delicate sweets, preferred to the oranges of Palma and the preserves of Genoa the chestnuts stolen from the neighbor by crossing the hedges, or the dried apples in his attic, while he had at his disposal the chestnuts and apples of our orchard.
044.122 "One day, Benedetto could be five or six years old, the neighbor Wasilio, who, according to the habits of our country, did not lock up either his purse or his jewels, because, as the Count knows as well as anyone, in Corsica there are no thieves, the neighbor Wasilio complained to us that a louis had disappeared from his purse; we thought he had counted it wrongly, but he pretended to be sure of his facts. That day Benedetto had left the house in the morning, and it was a great concern to us, when in the evening we saw him return dragging a monkey which he said he had found chained to the foot of a tree.
044.123 "For a month the passion of the wicked child, who did not know what to imagine, was to have a monkey. A juggler who had passed through Rogliano, and who had several of these animals whose exercises had delighted him greatly, had inspired this unhappy fantasy in him.
044.124 "--We do not find monkeys in our woods," I said to him, "and especially not chained monkeys; so tell me how you got this one.
044.125 "Benedetto supported his lie, and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his imagination than to his truthfulness; I became irritated, he began to laugh; I threatened him, he took two steps back.
044.126 "--You cannot beat me, he said, you have no right to do so, you are not my father.
044. 127 "We still did not know who had revealed to him this fatal secret, which we had hidden from him, however, with such care; however, this answer, in which the child revealed himself completely, almost frightened me, my raised arm fell back without touching the guilty party; The child triumphed, and this victory gave him such audacity that from that moment all the money of Assunta, whose love seemed to increase for him as he was less worthy of it, passed in caprices that she did not know how to fight, in follies that she did not have the courage to prevent. When I was in Rogliano, things were still going well enough; but as soon as I left, it was Benedetto who became the master of the house, and everything went wrong. Benedetto was barely eleven years old, and all his comrades were chosen from among the young men of eighteen or twenty, the worst subjects of Bastia and Corte, and already, for some mischief that deserved a more serious name, the law had given us warnings.
044.128 "I was frightened; any information could have disastrous consequences: I was just about to be forced to leave Corsica for an important expedition. I thought about it for a long time, and, with the presentiment of avoiding some misfortune, I decided to take Benedetto with me. I hoped that the active and rough life of a smuggler, the severe discipline of the ship, would change this character, which was ready to corrupt itself, if it was not already terribly corrupted.
044.129 "So I pulled Benedetto aside and made him the proposal to follow me, surrounding this proposal with all the promises that can seduce a child of twelve.
044.130 "He let me go through with it, and when I had finished, bursting out laughing:
044.131 "--Are you mad, uncle?" he said (he called me that when he was in a good mood); "I would change the life I lead for the one you lead, my good and excellent laziness for the horrible work you have imposed on yourself! to spend the night in the cold, the day in the heat; to hide incessantly; when you show yourself to be shot at, and all this to earn a little money! I have as much money as I want! Mother Assunta gives me money when I ask her for it. So you can see that I would be a fool if I accepted what you are proposing.
044.132 "I was stunned by this audacity and reasoning. Benedetto returned to play with his comrades, and I saw him from afar showing me to them as a fool.
044.133 --Charming child!" murmured Monte Cristo.
044.134 --Oh! if he had been mine, replied Bertuccio, if he had been my son, or at least my nephew, I would have brought him back to the right path, for conscience gives strength. But the idea that I was going to beat a child whose father I had killed made any correction impossible. I gave good advice to my sister, who, in our discussions, constantly took the defense of the little wretch, and as she confessed to me that several times she had been short of considerable sums, I indicated to her a place where she could hide our little treasure. As for me, my resolution was taken. Benedetto knew perfectly well how to read, write and count, because when he wanted to work, he learned in a day what others learned in a week. My resolution, I said, was made; I was to hire him as a secretary on some long-distance ship, and, without warning him of anything, to have him picked up one fine morning and carried on board; in this way, and by recommending him to the captain, his whole future depended on him. With this plan decided upon, I left for France.
044.135 "All our operations were to be carried out this time in the Gulf of Lions, and these operations became more and more difficult, for it was 1829. Tranquility was perfectly restored, and consequently the service of the coasts had become more regular and more severe than ever. This surveillance was momentarily increased by the fair of Beaucaire, which had just opened.
044.136 "The beginnings of our expedition went off without a hitch. We moored our boat, which had a double bottom in which we hid our contraband, in the midst of a quantity of boats which lined both banks of the Rhone, from Beaucaire to Arles. Once there, we began to unload our prohibited goods at night, and to bring them into the city through the intermediary of people who were in contact with us, or of the innkeepers at whose houses we made deposits. Either that success had made us imprudent, or that we had been betrayed, one evening, at about five o'clock in the afternoon, as we were about to have a snack, our little scullery boy came running in all frightened, saying that he had seen a squad of customs officers heading our way. It was not precisely the squad that frightened us: at any moment, especially at that time, whole companies were prowling the banks of the Rhone; but it was the precautions that the child said this squad was taking to avoid being seen. In an instant we were on our feet, but it was already too late; our boat, obviously the object of the research, was surrounded. Among the customs officers, I noticed some gendarmes; and, as timid at the sight of these as I was usually brave at the sight of any other military corps, I went down into the hold, and, slipping through a porthole, I let myself sink into the river, then I swam between two waters, breathing only at long intervals, so that I gained without being seen a trench which had just been made, and which communicated from the Rhone to the canal which goes from Beaucaire to Aigues-Mortes. Once arrived there, I was saved, because I could follow this trench without being seen. So I reached the canal without any accident. It was not by chance and without premeditation that I had followed this path; I have already spoken to Your Excellency about an innkeeper from Nîmes who had established a small inn on the road from Bellegarde to Beaucaire.
044.137 --Yes, said Monte Cristo, I remember perfectly. This worthy man, if I am not mistaken, was even your associate.
044.138 --That's right, replied Bertuccio; but seven or eight years ago he had given up his establishment to a former tailor from Marseilles who, after having ruined himself in his own state, had wanted to try to make his fortune in another. It goes without saying that the little arrangements we had made with the first owner were maintained with the second; it was therefore to this man that I intended to seek asylum.
044.139 --And what was the name of this man? asked the Count, who seemed to be beginning to take some interest in Bertuccio's story.
044.140 -- His name was Gaspard Caderousse, he was married to a woman from the village of Carconte, and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her village; she was a poor woman afflicted with swamp fever, who was dying of languor. As for the man, he was a sturdy fellow of forty to forty-five years of age, who had more than once, in difficult circumstances, given us proof of his presence of mind and his courage.
044.141 --And you say," asked Monte Cristo, "that these things happened about the year ....
044.142 --1829, Count.
044.143 -- In what month?
044.144 --In the month of June.
044.145 --At the beginning or at the end.
044.146 --That was the 3rd in the evening.
044.147 --Ah!" said Monte Cristo, "the 3rd of June 1829... Well, continue.
044. I was going to ask for asylum at Caderousse; I was not going to enter his house by the door which gave on to the road, but, as it was usual, and even under ordinary circumstances, I resolved not to depart from this custom, I stepped over the hedge of the garden, I crept through the stunted olive trees and the wild fig trees, and I gained, in the fear that Caderousse had some traveler in his inn, a sort of loft in which more than once I had spent the night as well as in the best bed. This loft was separated from the common room on the first floor of the inn only by a plank partition in which days had been arranged for our use, so that from there we could watch for the opportune moment to make it known that we were in the neighborhood. I intended, if Caderousse was alone, to warn him of my arrival, to finish at his place the meal interrupted by the appearance of the customs officers, and to benefit from the storm which was preparing to regain the banks of the Rhone and to ensure me of what had become of the boat and those which assembled it. I thus slipped into the loft, and I was well advised to do so, for at that very moment Caderousse was returning home with a stranger.
044.149 "I kept my mouth shut and waited, not with the intention of surprising the secrets of my host, but because I could not do otherwise; besides, ten times the same thing had already happened.
044.150 "The man who accompanied Caderousse was obviously a stranger to the south of France: he was one of those fairground merchants who come to sell jewelry at the Beaucaire fair and who, during the month that this fair lasts, where merchants and buyers from all parts of Europe flock, sometimes do business for a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand francs.
044.151 "Caderousse entered briskly and first. Then seeing the room below empty as usual and simply guarded by his dog, he called his wife.
044.152 "--Hey! la Carconte," he said, "this worthy man of a priest had not deceived us; the diamond was good.
044.153 "A joyful exclamation was heard, and almost immediately the stairs creaked under a step weighed down by weakness and illness.
044.154 "--What are you saying?" asked the woman, paler than a dead woman.
044.155 "--I say that the diamond was good, that here is monsieur, one of the leading jewelers in Paris, who is ready to give us fifty thousand francs for it. Only, to be sure that the diamond is really ours, he asks that you tell him, as I have already done, in what miraculous way the diamond fell into our hands. In the meantime, sir, please sit down, and as the weather is heavy, I will go and get something to refresh you.
044.156 "The jeweler carefully examined the interior of the inn and the visible poverty of those who were going to sell him a diamond that seemed to have come out of a prince's case.
044.157 "--Tell me, madam," he said, no doubt wanting to take advantage of the husband's absence so that no sign on his part would influence the wife, and to see if the two stories would fit together well.
044.158 "--Oh, my God!" said the wife volubly, "this is a blessing from heaven which we were far from expecting. Imagine, my dear sir, that my husband was linked in 1814 or 1815 with a sailor named Edmond Dantes: this poor boy, whom Caderousse had completely forgotten, did not forget him, and left him, on dying, the diamond that you have just seen.
044.159 "--But how did he come to possess this diamond?" asked the jeweler. So he had it before he went to prison?
044. 160 "--No, sir," replied the woman, "but in prison he made the acquaintance of a very rich Englishman, so it seems; And as in prison his companion fell ill, and Dantes took the same care of him as if he were his brother, the Englishman, on leaving captivity, left to poor Dantes, who, less fortunate than himself, died in prison, this diamond which he in turn bequeathed to us on dying, and which he charged the worthy abbot who came this morning to give us.
044.161 "-It is indeed the same thing, murmured the jeweler, and, in the end the story can be true, however implausible it seems at first sight. It is only the price on which we disagree.
044.162 "-How! not in agreement, said Caderousse; I thought you had agreed to the price I asked for it.
044.163 "--I mean," resumed the jeweler, "that I offered forty thousand francs.
044.164 "--Forty thousand!" cried the Carconte; "we will certainly not give it for that price. The abbot told us that it was worth fifty thousand francs, and without the mount yet.
044.165 "--And what was the name of this abbot?" asked the tireless questioner.
044.166 "--Abbot Busoni," answered the woman.
044.167 "--So he was a foreigner?
044.168 "--It was an Italian from the vicinity of Mantua, I believe.
044.169 "-Show me this diamond, resumed the jeweler, that I see it a second time; often one judges the stones badly with a first sight."
044.170 "Caderousse drew from his pocket a small black chagrin case, opened it and passed it to the jeweler. At the sight of the diamond, which was as big as a small hazelnut, I remember it as if I were still seeing it, the eyes of Carconte sparkled with greed.
044.171 --And what did you think of all this, Mr. Eavesdropper?" asked Monte Cristo; "did you believe this beautiful tale?
044.172 -- Yes, Your Excellency; I did not regard Caderousse as a bad man, and I believed him incapable of having committed a crime or even a theft.
044.173 --That does more credit to your heart than to your experience, Mr. Bertuccio. Did you know this Edmond Dantes of whom there was talk?
044.174 --No, Excellency, I had never heard of him until then, and I have never heard of him since except once by the Abbé Busoni himself, when I saw him in the prisons of Nimes.
044.175 --Good! Continue.
044.176 --The jeweler took the ring from Caderousse's hands, and drew from his pocket a small pair of steel tongs and a small pair of copper scales; then, pulling aside the gold studs that held the stone in the ring, he brought the diamond out of its socket, and weighed it meticulously in the scales.
044.177 "--I'll go as high as forty-five thousand francs," he said, "but I won't give a penny with it; besides, as that was what the diamond was worth, I took just that sum on myself.
044.178 "--Oh, never mind," said Caderousse, "I'll go back with you to Beaucaire to get the other five thousand francs.
044.179 "--No," said the jeweler, giving the ring and the diamond back to Caderousse; "no, it is not worth more, and I am still angry at having offered this sum, since there is a defect in the stone that I had not seen at first; but never mind, I have only one word, I said forty-five thousand francs, I do not disavow myself of it.
044.180 "--At least put the diamond back in the ring," said the Carconte bitterly.
044.181 "--That's right, said the jeweler.
044.182 "And he put the stone back in the bezel.
044.183 "--Good, good, good, said Caderousse putting back the case in his pocket, one will sell it to another.
044. 184 "--Yes," continued the jeweler, "but another will not be so easy as I am; another will not be satisfied with the information you have given me; it is not natural that a man like you should possess a diamond worth fifty thousand francs; he will go and warn the magistrates, the Abbé Busoni must be found, and abbots who give diamonds worth two thousand louis are rare; justice will begin by getting hold of it, you will be sent to prison, and if you are found innocent, you will be thrown out after three or four months of captivity, the ring will have gone astray at the registry, or you will be given a false stone that will be worth three francs instead of a diamond that is worth fifty thousand, fifty-five thousand perhaps, but that, you will agree, my good man, one runs certain risks in buying. "
044.185 "Caderousse and his wife questioned each other with their eyes.
044.186 "--No, said Caderousse, we are not rich enough to lose five thousand francs.
044.187 "--As you wish, my dear friend, said the jeweler; I had, however, as you see, brought beautiful money.
044.188 "And he drew from one of his pockets a handful of gold which he made shine in the dazzled eyes of the innkeeper, and, from the other, a packet of bank bills.
044.189 "A hard fight was visibly waged in Caderousse's mind: it was obvious that this little case of sorrow which he turned over and over in his hand did not seem to him to correspond in value to the enormous sum which fascinated his eyes. He turned back to his wife.
044.190 "--What do you say?" he asked her softly.
044.191 "--Give, give, she said; if he returns to Beaucaire without the diamond, he will denounce us! and, as he says, who knows if we will ever be able to get our hands on the Abbé Busoni again.
044.192 "--Well, so be it," said Caderousse, "take the diamond for forty-five thousand francs; but my wife wants a gold chain, and I want a pair of silver earrings.
044.193 "The jeweler drew from his pocket a long, flat box which contained several samples of the objects requested.
044.194 "--There, he said, I am round in business; choose.
044.195 "The wife chose a gold chain that could be worth five louis, and the husband a pair of earrings that could be worth fifteen francs.
044.196 "--I hope you will not complain, said the jeweler.
044.197 "--The abbot had said that it was worth fifty thousand francs, murmured Caderousse.
044.198 "--All right, all right, give it! What a terrible man!" said the jeweler, pulling the diamond out of his hands, "I count him forty-five thousand francs, two thousand five hundred pounds of income, that is to say, a fortune such as I would like to have, and he is not yet happy.
044.199 "--And the forty-five thousand francs," asked Caderousse in a hoarse voice; "let's see, where are they?
044.200 "--Here they are, said the jeweler.
044.201 "And he counted on the table fifteen thousand francs in gold and thirty thousand francs in bank bills.
044.202 "-Wait until I light the lamp, said the Carconte, it is no longer clear, and one could be mistaken.
044.203 "Indeed, the night had come during this discussion, and, with the night, the storm that had been threatening for half an hour. One could hear the thunder rumbling in the distance; but neither the jeweler, nor Caderousse, nor Carconte, seemed to care, possessed as they were all three by the demon of gain. I myself felt a strange fascination at the sight of all that gold and all those bills. It seemed to me that I was having a dream, and, as happens in a dream, I felt chained to my place.
044.204 "Caderousse counted and recounted the gold and bills, then passed them to his wife, who counted and recounted them in turn.
044.205 "Meanwhile, the jeweler made the diamond shimmer under the rays of the lamp, and the diamond threw lightning bolts which made him forget those which, precursors of the storm, were beginning to ignite the windows.
044.206 "--Well, is the account there?" asked the jeweler.
044.207 "--Yes," said Caderousse; "give the wallet and look for a bag, Carconte.
044.208 "La Carconte went to a cupboard and returned bringing an old leather wallet, from which some greasy letters were taken and in whose place the bills were put, and a bag in which were locked up two or three six-pound écus, which probably made up the whole fortune of the miserable household.
044.209 "--There," said Caderousse, "although you have raised for us perhaps ten thousand francs, would you like to dine with us?
044.210 "--Thank you," said the jeweler, "it must be getting late, and I must return to Beaucaire; my wife would be worried"; he drew his watch. "Morbleu!" he cried, "nine o'clock soon; I shall not be in Beaucaire before midnight. Farewell, my little children; if you happen to come back from the Busoni abbots, think of me.
044.211 "--In eight days you will no longer be in Beaucaire," said Caderousse, "since the fair ends next week.
044.212 "--No, but that doesn't matter; write to me in Paris, to M. Joannès, at the Palais-Royal, Galerie de Pierre, no. 45, I will make the trip on purpose if it is worth it.
044.213 "A thunderclap resounded, accompanied by a flash of lightning so violent that it almost erased the light of the lamp.
044.214 "--Oh! oh!" said Caderousse, "are you going to leave in this weather?
044.215 "--Oh! I am not afraid of thunder, said the jeweler.
044.216 "--And of thieves?" asked the Carconte. The road is never very safe during the fair.
044.217 "--Oh! as for the thieves, said Joannès, here is for them.
044.218 "And he drew from his pocket a pair of small pistols loaded to the mouth.
044.219 "--Here," he said, "dogs that bark and bite at the same time: it's for the first two who would like your diamond, Father Caderousse.
044.220 "Caderousse and his wife exchanged a dark look. It seems that they had at the same time some terrible thought.
044.221 "--So, have a good trip! said Caderousse.
044.222 "--Thank you!" said the jeweler.
044.223 "He took his cane, which he had placed against an old chest, and went out. As he opened the door, such a gust of wind came in that it almost put out the lamp.
044.224 "--Oh!" he said, "it's going to be a lovely day, and two leagues of country to go in this weather!
044.225 "--Resit, said Caderousse, you will sleep here.
044.226 "--Yes, stay," said the Carconte in a trembling voice, "we will take good care of you.
044.227 "--No, I must go to sleep in Beaucaire. Farewell."
044.228 "Caderousse went slowly to the threshold.
044.229 "--It is neither heaven nor earth," said the jeweler already outside the house. Should we go right or left?
044.230 "--Right," said Caderousse; there is no mistaking it, the road is lined with trees on either side.
044.231 "--Well, I'm there, said the voice almost lost in the distance.
044.232 "--Close the door, says the Carconte, I do not like the doors open when it thunders.
044.233 "--And when there is money in the house, right?" said Caderousse, giving a double turn to the lock.
044.234 "He returned, went to the cupboard, took out the bag and the wallet, and both began to recount for the third time their gold and their bills. I have never seen such an expression on those two faces whose greed was illuminated by that meager lamp. The woman especially was hideous; the feverish trembling which usually animated her had redoubled. Her pale face had become livid; her hollow eyes flamed.
044.235 "-Why then," she asked in a dull voice, "did you offer her to sleep here?
044.236 "--But," Caderousse answered, shuddering, "so that he wouldn't have the trouble of returning to Beaucaire.
044.237 "--Ah!" said the woman with an expression impossible to render, "I thought it was for something else.
044.238 "--Woman! woman!" cried Caderousse, "why do you have such ideas, and why don't you keep them to yourself?
044.239 "-It's all the same," said the Carconte after a moment's silence, "you are not a man.
044.240 "--How so?" said Caderousse.
044.241 "--If you had been a man, he would not have gone out.
044.242 "--Woman!
044.243 "--Or it would not arrive at Beaucaire.
044.244 "--Woman!
044.245 "--The road makes a bend and it is obliged to follow the road, while there is along the channel a way which shortens.
044.246 "--Woman, you offend the Good God. Here, listen....
044.247 "Indeed, one heard a frightful thunderclap at the same time that a bluish lightning ignited all the room, and the lightning, decreasing slowly, seemed to move away as with regret from the cursed house.
044.248 "--Jesus!" said the Carconte, signing herself.
044.249 "At the same instant, and in the midst of that silence of terror which ordinarily follows thunderclaps, one heard a knock at the door.
044.250 "Caderousse and his wife shuddered and looked at each other in horror.
044.251 "--Who goes there?" cried Caderousse, rising and gathering in a single heap the gold and bills scattered on the table, which he covered with his two hands.
044.252 "--Me!" said a voice.
044.253 "--Who, you?
044.254 "--And by God! Joannes the jeweler.
044.255 "--Well, what did you say," said the Carconte with a frightful smile, "that I was offending the Good Lord! Here is the Good Lord who is sending him back to us.
044.256 "Caderousse fell back into his chair, pale and panting. La Carconte, on the other hand, got up and went with a firm step to the door, which she opened.
044.257 "--Enter then, dear Mr. Joannes," she said.
044.258 "--My faith," said the jeweler, dripping with rain, "it seems that the devil does not want me to return to Beaucaire this evening. The shortest follies are the best, my dear Monsieur Caderousse; you have offered me hospitality, I accept it and I come back to sleep at your place."
044.259 Caderousse stammered a few words while wiping the sweat that ran down his forehead. La Carconte closed the door behind the jeweler.
045.000 The rain of blood.
045.001 "As he entered, the jeweler cast a questioning glance around him; but nothing seemed to raise suspicions if he had none, nothing seemed to confirm them if he had any.
045.002 "Caderousse still held his bills and gold in both hands. Carconte smiled at her host as pleasantly as she could.
045.003 "--Ah! ah!" said the jeweler, "it seems that you were afraid not to have your account, that you would return your treasure after I had left.
045.004 "--No," said Caderousse; "but the event which makes us its possessor is so unexpected that we cannot believe it, and that, when we do not have the material proof before our eyes, we believe we are still dreaming."
045.005 "The jeweler smiles.
045.006 "--Do you have travelers in your inn?" he asked.
045.007 "--No," replied Caderousse, "we don't give lodging; we are too close to the city, and nobody stops.
045.008 "--So, I am going to bother you horribly?
045.009 "--Hinder us, you! my dear sir!" said the Carconte graciously, "not at all, I swear.
045.010 "--Let's see, where do you put me?
045.011 "--In the room upstairs.
045.012 "--But isn't that your room?
045.013 "--Oh, never mind; we have a second bed in the room next to this one.
045.014 "Caderousse looked at his wife with astonishment. The jeweler sang a little tune while warming his back to a faggot that Carconte had just lit in the fireplace to dry his guest.
045.015 "Meanwhile, she brought on a corner of the table where she had spread a napkin the meager remains of a dinner, to which she joined two or three fresh eggs.
045.016 "Caderousse had put the bills back in his wallet, his gold in a bag, and everything in his cupboard. He walked up and down, sombre and pensive, raising his head from time to time to the jeweler, who stood smoking before the hearth, and who, as he dried himself on one side, turned to the other.
045.017 "--There," said the Carconte, placing a bottle of wine on the table, "when you want to have supper everything is ready.
045.018 "--And you?" asked Joannes.
045.019 "--Me, I will not have supper, answered Caderousse.
045.020 "--We dined very late," said Carconte hastily.
045.021 "--So I'm going to have supper alone? said the jeweler.
045.022 "--We will serve you," replied the Carconte with an eagerness that was not usual for him, even with his paying guests.
045.023 "From time to time Caderousse cast a glance at her as quick as a flash of lightning.
045.024 "The storm continued.
045.025 "--Do you hear, do you hear?" said the Carconte; "you have, my faith, done well to return.
045.026 "-This does not prevent, said the jeweler, that if, during my supper, the hurricane subsides, I will set out again.
045.027 "--That's the mistral, said Caderousse, shaking his head; we'll have it until tomorrow.
045.028 "And he sighed.
045.029 "--My faith, said the jeweler as he sat down to eat, so much the worse for those who are outside.
045.030 "--Yes," said the Carconte, "they will have a bad night.
045.031 "The jeweler began to dine, and the Carconte continued to have for him all the small care of an attentive hostess; she, usually so quintet and so surly, had become a model of thoughtfulness and politeness. If the jeweler had known her before, such a great change would certainly have surprised him and would not have failed to inspire some suspicion. As for Caderousse, he did not say a word, continuing his walk and seeming to hesitate even to look at his host.
045.032 "When supper was over, Caderousse went himself to open the door.
045.033 "--I believe that the storm is calming down, he said.
045.034 "But at this moment, as if to give him a denial, a terrible thunderclap shook the house, and a gust of wind mixed with rain entered, which extinguished the lamp.
045.035 "Caderousse closed the door; his wife lit a candle in the dying blaze.
045.036 "--Here, she said to the jeweler, you must be tired; I put white sheets on the bed, go upstairs and sleep well.
045.037 "Joannes stayed a moment longer to make sure that the hurricane was not abating, and when he was certain that the thunder and rain were only increasing, he wished his guests good morning and went up the stairs.
045.038 "He passed over my head, and I could hear every step creak under his feet.
045.039 "La Carconte followed him with an avid eye, while on the contrary Caderousse turned his back and did not even look at his side.
045.040 "All these details, which have come back to my mind since that time, did not strike me at the moment they were happening before my eyes; there was, to all intents and purposes, nothing but natural in what was happening, and, apart from the story of the diamond, which seemed to me a little implausible, everything was going to happen. Also as I was crushed of tiredness, that I counted to benefit myself from the first respite that the storm would give to the elements, I resolved to sleep a few hours and to move away in the middle of the night.
045.041 "I heard in the room above the jeweler, who took on his side all his provisions to pass the best possible night. Soon his bed creaked under him; he had just gone to bed.
045.042 "I felt my eyes closing in spite of myself, and as I had not conceived any suspicion, I did not try to fight sleep; I threw a last glance at the interior of the kitchen. Caderousse was seated beside a long table, on one of those wooden benches which, in village inns, replace chairs; he had his back to me, so that I could not see his face; besides, had he been in the opposite position, it would still have been impossible for me, since he was holding his head buried in his two hands.
045.043 "La Carconte looked at him for a while, shrugged his shoulders and came to sit down opposite him.
045.044 "At this moment the dying flame gained a remnant of dry wood forgotten by it; a slightly brighter glow illuminated the dark interior.... The Carconte held her eyes fixed on her husband, and as this one remained always in the same position, I saw her extend towards him her hooked hand, and she touched him in the forehead.
045.045 "Caderousse shuddered. It seemed to me that the woman was moving her lips, but either she was speaking very low, or my senses were already numbed by sleep, the sound of her speech did not reach me. I could only see through a fog and with that doubt which is the precursor of sleep, during which one believes that one is beginning a dream. Finally my eyes closed, and I lost consciousness of myself.
045.046 "I was in the depths of my sleep, when I was awakened by a pistol shot, followed by a terrible scream. A few staggering footsteps echoed on the bedroom floor, and an inert mass came crashing down the stairs, just above my head.
045.047 "I was still not quite in control of myself. I heard groans, then muffled cries like those that accompany a struggle.
045.048 "A last cry, more prolonged than the others and which degenerated into groans, came to pull me completely out of my lethargy.
045.049 "I raised myself on one arm, opened my eyes, which saw nothing in the darkness, and I brought my hand to my forehead, on which it seemed to me that a tepid and abundant rain was dripping through the boards of the staircase.
045.050 "The deepest silence had succeeded to this frightful noise. I heard the footsteps of a man walking above my head, his footsteps made the stairs creak. The man went down into the lower room, approached the fireplace and lit a candle.
045.051 "That man was Caderousse; his face was pale, and his shirt was all bloody.
045.052 "With the candle lit, he went quickly up the stairs, and I heard his rapid and anxious steps again.
045.053 "A moment later he came back down. He held the box in his hand; he made sure that the diamond was in it, looked for a moment in which of his pockets he would put it; then, no doubt, not considering his pocket a safe enough hiding place, he rolled it up in his red handkerchief, which he wrapped around his neck.
045.054 "Then he ran to the cupboard, drew out his bills and gold, put the one in the pocket of his pants, the other in the pocket of his jacket, took two or three shirts, and, rushing to the door, disappeared into the darkness. Then all became clear and lucid for me; I reproached myself for what had just happened, as if I had been the real culprit. It seemed to me to hear groans: the unfortunate jeweler could not be dead; perhaps it was in my power, by helping him, to repair a part of the evil not that I had made, but that I had let make. I leaned my shoulders against one of the loose boards that separated the sort of drum in which I was lying from the lower room; the boards gave way, and I found myself in the house.
045.055 "I ran to the candle, and I dashed up the stairs; a body crossed it, it was the corpse of the Carconte.
045.056 "The pistol shot I had heard had been fired at her: her throat was cut through and through, and besides her double wound which was flowing, she was vomiting blood from her mouth. She was quite dead. I stepped over her body and passed.
045.057 "The room offered the aspect of the most dreadful disorder. Two or three pieces of furniture were overturned; the sheets, to which the unfortunate jeweler had clung, were dragging through the room: he himself was lying on the floor, his head leaning against the wall, swimming in a pool of blood that was escaping from three large wounds received in the chest.
045.058 "In the fourth wound was a long kitchen knife, of which only the handle could be seen.
045.059 "I stepped on the second pistol which had not gone off, the powder probably being wet.
045.060 "I approached the jeweler; he was not actually dead: at the noise I made, especially at the shaking of the floor, he reopened his haggard eyes, managed to fix them on me for a moment, moved his lips as if he wanted to speak, and expired.
045.061 "This terrible spectacle had made me almost insane; from the moment when I could no longer help anyone I felt only one need, that of fleeing. I rushed down the stairs, thrusting my hands into my hair and uttering a roar of terror.
045.062 "In the lower room there were five or six customs officers and two or three gendarmes, a whole armed troop.
045.063 "I was seized; I did not even try to resist, I was no longer the master of my senses. I tried to speak, I uttered a few inarticulate cries, that was all.
045.064 "I saw that the customs officers and the gendarmes were pointing at me; I lowered my eyes to myself, I was all covered with blood. That warm rain that I had felt falling on me through the boards of the stairs was the blood of the Carconte.
045.065 "I pointed to the place where I was hidden.
045.066 "--What does he mean?" asked a gendarme.
045.067 "A customs officer went to see.
045.068 "--He means that he went that way," he answered.
045.069 "And he showed the hole through which I had actually passed.
045.070 "Then I understood that I was taken for the assassin. I found my voice again, I found my strength again; I freed myself from the hands of the two men who held me, crying out:
045.071 "-It's not me! It's not me!
045.072 "Two gendarmes held me at gunpoint with their rifles.
045.073 "-If you make a move, they said, you are dead.
045.074 "-But," I cried, "since I keep telling you it wasn't me!
045.075 "--You will tell your little story to the judges of Nîmes, they answered. In the meantime, follow us; and if we have an advice to give you, it is not to make resistance.
045.076 "It was not my intention, I was broken by astonishment and terror. I was handcuffed, tied to the tail of a horse, and taken to Nîmes.
045.077 "I had been followed by a customs officer; he had lost sight of me in the vicinity of the house, he had suspected that I would spend the night there; he had gone to warn his companions, and they had arrived just to hear the pistol shot and to catch me in the midst of such evidence of guilt, that I understood at once the difficulty I would have in having my innocence recognized.
045.078 "Also, I attached myself to only one thing: my first request to the examining magistrate was to ask him to have a certain Abbé Busoni, who had stopped during the day at the Pont-du-Gard inn, searched everywhere. If Caderousse had invented a story, if this abbot did not exist, it was obvious that I was lost, unless Caderousse was caught in his turn and confessed everything.
045.079 "Two months passed during which, I must say to the praise of my judge, all searches were made to find the one I asked for. I had already lost all hope. Caderousse had not been taken. I was going to be judged at the first session, when on September 8, that is to say three months and five days after the event, the abbot Busoni, on whom I did not hope any more, presented himself at the jail, saying that he had learned that a prisoner wished to speak to him. He had known, he said, the thing in Marseilles, and he hastened to give himself up to my desire.
045.080 "You understand with what ardor I received him; I told him all that I had witnessed, I approached with anxiety the story of the diamond; against my expectation it was true from point to point; against my expectation again, he added complete faith to all that I told him. It was then that drawn by his sweet charity, recognizing in him a deep knowledge of the customs of my country, thinking that the forgiveness of the only crime I had committed could perhaps descend from his so charitable lips, I told him, under the seal of the confession, the adventure of Auteuil in all its details. The confession of this first murder, which nothing forced me to reveal to him, proved to him that I had not committed the second, and he left me with the order to hope, and with the promise to do everything in his power to convince my judges of my innocence.
045.081 "I had proof that he had indeed taken care of me when I saw my prison gradually softening, and when I learned that they would wait to judge me at the trials which were to follow those for which they were gathering.
045.082 "In the meantime, Providence allowed Caderousse to be caught abroad and brought back to France. He confessed to everything, blaming his wife for the premeditation and especially the instigation. He was condemned to the galleys for life, and I was set free.
045.083 -- And it was then," said Monte Cristo, "that you came to my house bearing a letter from the Abbé Busoni?
045.084 -- Yes, Excellency, he had taken a visible interest in me.
045.085 "--Your status as a smuggler will be your undoing, he said to me; if you leave here, leave him.
045.086 "--But my father," I asked, "how do you want me to live and support my poor sister?
One of my penitents," he answered, "has a high regard for me, and has asked me to find him a man he can trust. Do you want to be that man? I will refer you to him.
045.088 "--O my father!" I cried, "how good!
045.089 "--But you swear to me that I will never have to repent."
045.090 "I stretched out my hand to take the oath.
045.091 "--It is useless, he said, I know and love the Corsicans, here is my recommendation.
045.092 "And he wrote the few lines that I gave you, and on which Your Excellency was kind enough to take me into his service. Now I ask Your Excellency with pride, did you ever have any complaints about me?
045.093 --No, replied the Count; and, I confess with pleasure, you are a good servant, Bertuccio, though you lack confidence.
045.094 --Me, sir count!
045.095 --Yes, you. How is it that you have a sister and an adopted son, and yet you have never spoken to me about either of them!
045.096 -- Alas, Your Excellency, it is that I still have to tell you the saddest part of my life. I left for Corsica. I was in a hurry, you understand it well, to see again and to console my poor sister; but when I arrived at Rogliano, I found the house in mourning; there had been a horrible scene and of which the neighbors still keep the memory! My poor sister, according to my advice, resisted the demands of Benedetto, who, at every moment, wanted to be given all the money there was in the house. One morning he threatened her, and disappeared for the whole day. She cried, because this dear Assunta had a mother's heart for the wretch. The evening came, she waited for him without going to bed. When, at eleven o'clock, he returned with two of his friends, ordinary companions of all his follies, then she held out her arms to him; but they seized her, and one of the three, I fear it was that infernal child, one of the three cried out:
045.097 "--Let's play the question, and she will have to confess where her money is.
045.098 "Just then the neighbor Wasilio was in Bastia; his wife alone remained at home. No one but her could see or hear what was going on at my sister's house. Two held back the poor Assunta, who, not being able to believe in the possibility of such a crime, smiled at those who were going to become her executioners, the third went to barricade doors and windows, then he returned, and all three gathered, choking the cries which terror tore to him in front of these more serious preparations, approached the feet of Assunta to the brazier on which they counted to make him confess where our small treasure was hidden; but, in the fight, the fire took to her clothes: they let go then the patient, not to be burned themselves. All in flames she ran to the door, but the door was closed.
045.099 "She ran to the window, but the window was barricaded. Then the neighbor heard terrible cries: it was Assunta who called for help. Soon her voice was muffled; the cries became groans, and the next day, after a night of terror and anguish when Wasilio's wife ventured out of her house and had the judge open the door of our house, Assunta was found half-burned, but still breathing, the cupboards broken open, the money gone. As for Benedetto, he had left Rogliano never to return; since that day I have not seen him again, nor have I even heard of him.
045.100 "It was," said Bertuccio, "after I had heard this sad news, that I went to your Excellency. I no longer had to speak to you about Benedetto, since he had disappeared, nor about my sister, since she was dead.
045.101 --And what did you think of this event?
045.102 -- That it was the punishment for the crime I had committed, replied Bertuccio. Ah, those Villeforts were a cursed race.
045.103 --I believe it, murmured the Count with a gloomy accent.
045.104 --And now, don't you think," resumed Bertuccio, "Your Excellency understands that this house which I have not seen since, that this garden where I suddenly found myself, that this square where I killed a man, could have caused me these dark emotions whose source you wanted to know; for finally I am not quite sure that before me, there, at my feet, M. de Villefort is not lying in the grave he had dug for his child.
045.105 -- Indeed, everything is possible, said Monte Cristo, rising from the bench where he was sitting; even, he added softly, that the king's prosecutor is not dead. The Abbé Busoni did well to send you to me. You have done well to tell me your story, for I will not have bad thoughts about you. As for this Benedetto so badly named, have you never tried to trace him? Have you never tried to find out what became of him?
045.106 --If I had known where he was, instead of going to him, I would have fled as if from a monster. Not fortunately, I never heard of him from anyone in the world, I hope he is dead.
045.107 --Don't hope, Bertuccio, said the Count; the wicked do not die like that, for God seems to take them under his care to make them the instrument of his vengeance.
045.108 -So be it, said Bertuccio. All I ask of heaven is that I never see him again. Now," continued the steward, lowering his head, "you know everything, sir count; you are my judge here below as God will be up there; will you not say a few words of consolation to me?
045.109 -- You are right, indeed, and I can tell you what Abbot Busoni would say to you: the one you struck, this Villefort, deserved to be punished for what he had done to you and perhaps for something else. Benedetto, if he lives, will serve, as I told you, for some divine vengeance, and then will be punished in his turn. As for you, you have only one reproach to make: ask yourself why, having taken this child from death, you have not given him back to his mother: that is the crime, Bertuccio.
045.110 -- Yes, sir, that is the crime, and the real crime, for in that I was a coward. Once I had recalled the child to life, I had only one thing to do, as you said, and that was to send him back to his mother. But, for that, I had to make inquiries, to attract attention, to give myself up perhaps; I did not want to die, I held on to life by my sister, by the self-love innate in us others to remain whole and victorious in our revenge; and then finally, perhaps, I held on to life simply by the love of life itself. Oh! I am not a brave man like my poor brother!"
045.111 Bertuccio hid his face in his two hands, and Monte Cristo fixed on him a long and indefinable look.
045.112 Then, after a moment of silence, made even more solemn by the hour and the place:
045.113 "To end this interview, which will be the last on these adventures, with dignity, Mr. Bertuccio," said the Count with an accent of melancholy which was not usual for him, "remember my words well, I have often heard them pronounced by the Abbot Busoni himself: To all ills there are two remedies: time and silence. Now, Mr. Bertuccio, let me walk for a moment in this garden. What is a poignant emotion for you, actor in this scene, will be for me an almost sweet sensation and will give a double price to this property. Trees, you see, Mr. Bertuccio, are only pleasing because they provide shade, and shade itself is only pleasing because it is full of reveries and visions. I bought a garden thinking I was buying a simple walled enclosure, and suddenly it turns out to be a garden full of ghosts, which were not mentioned in the contract. Now, I like ghosts; I have never heard that the dead have done as much harm in six thousand years as the living do in one day. Go home, Mr. Bertuccio, and sleep in peace. If your confessor, at the supreme moment, is less indulgent than was Abbot Busoni, send for me if I am still of this world, I will find you words that will gently lull your soul at the moment when it is ready to set out on that rough journey called eternity."
045.114 Bertuccio bowed respectfully to the Count, and walked away with a sigh.
045.115 Monte Cristo remained alone; and, taking four steps forward
045.116 "Here, near this plane tree," he murmured, "is the pit where the child was laid: over there, the little door by which one entered the garden; at this corner, the hidden staircase which leads to the bedroom. I don't think I need to write all this down on my tablets, for there before my eyes, around me, under my feet, is the plan in relief, the living plan."
045.117 And the Count, after a last tour of this garden, went to find his carriage. Bertuccio, who saw him dreaming, climbed without saying anything on the seat beside the coachman.
045.118 The carriage took the road to Paris.
045.119 That evening, upon his arrival at the house on the Champs-Élysées, the Count of Monte Cristo visited the entire dwelling as a man who had been familiar with it for many years might have done; not once, although he walked first, did he open one door for another, or take a staircase or corridor that did not lead him directly to where he intended to go. Ali accompanied him in this nightly review. The Count gave Bertuccio several orders for the embellishment or new distribution of the house, and drawing his watch, he said to the attentive Nubian:
045.120 "It is half-past eleven; Haydée cannot be long in coming. Have the French women been warned?"
045.121 Ali stretched out his hand toward the apartment destined for the beautiful Greek woman, which was so isolated that by hiding the door behind a tapestry one could visit the whole house without suspecting that there was there a living room and two inhabited rooms; Ali, let us say then, stretched out his hand toward the apartment, showed the number three with the fingers of his left hand, and on that same hand, laid flat, leaning his head, closed his eyes in sleep.
045.122 "Ah!" said Monte Cristo, accustomed to this language, "there are three waiting in the bedroom, aren't there?
045.123 --Yes," said Ali, shaking his head up and down.
045.124 --Madame will be tired tonight, Monte Cristo continued, and no doubt she will want to sleep; let her not be made to speak: the French attendants must only greet their new mistress and retire; you will see to it that the Greek attendant does not communicate with the French attendants."
045.125 Ali bowed. Soon the concierge was heard to hail; the gate opened, a carriage rolled up the driveway and stopped in front of the stoop. The count got out; the door was already open; he held out his hand to a young woman wrapped in a green silk mantle all embroidered with gold which covered her head.
045.126 The young woman took the hand that was held out to her, kissed it with a certain love mixed with respect, and a few words were exchanged, tenderly on the part of the young woman and with a gentle gravity on the part of the count, in that sonorous language that old Homer put in the mouth of his gods.
045.127 Then, preceded by Ali who carried a pink wax torch, the young woman, who was none other than that beautiful Greek woman, Monte Cristo's ordinary companion in Italy, was led to her apartment, and then the Count retired to the pavilion he had reserved for himself.
045.128 At half past midnight, all the lights were out in the house, and one would have thought that everyone was asleep.
046.000 The unlimited credit.
046. 001 The next day, towards two o'clock in the afternoon, a carriage harnessed to two magnificent English horses stopped in front of Monte Cristo's door; a man dressed in a blue suit, with silk buttons of the same color, a white vest crisscrossed by an enormous gold chain and hazel-colored pants, with hair so black and falling so low on the eyebrows, that one could have hesitated to believe them natural so much they seemed little in harmony with those of the lower wrinkles which they did not manage to hide; a man finally of fifty to fifty-five years, and who tried to appear forty, passed his head by the door of a coupé on the panel of which was painted a baron's crown, and sent his bellboy to ask the concierge if the Count of Monte Cristo was at home.
046.002 In the meantime, this man considered, with such minute attention that it became almost impertinent, the exterior of the house, what could be distinguished from the garden, and the livery of some servants who could be seen coming and going. The man's eye was keen, but rather cunning than witty. His lips were so thin, that instead of protruding outwards they went into his mouth; finally the width and the prominence of the cheekbones, infallible sign of astuteness, the depression of the face, the bulge of the occiput, which exceeded much broad ears of the less aristocratic, contributed to give, for any physiognomist, a character almost repulsive with the figure of this character very recommendable with the eyes of the vulgar one by its splendid horses, the enormous diamond which it carried to its shirt and the red ribbon which extended from a buttonhole with the other of its clothing.
046.003 The bellboy knocked on the concierge's window and asked:
046.004 "Isn't this where the Count of Monte Cristo lives?
046.005 "This is where His Excellency lives," replied the concierge, "but..."
046.006 He consulted Ali with his eyes.
046.007 Ali made a negative sign.
046.008 "But?" asked the bellman.
046.009 --But His Excellency is not visible, replied the janitor.
046.010 --In that case, here is the card of my master, Baron Danglars. You will give it to the Count of Monte Cristo, and you will tell him that on his way to the Chamber my master has turned away to have the honor of seeing him.
046.011 --I do not speak to His Excellency," said the janitor; "the valet will make the commission."
046.012 The bellman returned to the carriage.
046.013 "Well?" asked Danglars.
046.014 The boy, rather ashamed of the lesson he had just received, brought his master the answer he had received from the concierge.
046.015 "Oh," said the latter, "this gentleman is a prince, let him be called Excellency, and let only his valet have the right to speak to him; anyway, since he has a credit on me, I must see him when he wants money.
046.016 And Danglars threw himself back into the back of his carriage, shouting to the coachman, so that he could be heard on the other side of the road:
046.017 "To the Chamber of Deputies!"
046.018 Through a jalousie in his pavilion, Monte Cristo, warned in time, had seen the baron and studied him, with the aid of an excellent spyglass, with no less attention than M. Danglars himself had put into analyzing the house, the garden, and the liveries.
046.019 "Decidedly," he said with a gesture of disgust, as he pushed the tubes of his telescope back into their ivory sheath, "decidedly this man is an ugly creature; how, from the first time one sees him, does one not recognize the snake with the flattened forehead, the vulture with the domed skull, and the buzzard with the sharp beak!
046.020 "Ali!" he shouted, and then struck a blow on the brass bell. Ali appeared. "Call Bertuccio," he said.
046.021 At the same moment Bertuccio entered.
046.022 "Your Excellency asked for me?" said the intendant.
046.023 --Yes, sir, said the Count. Did you see the horses that have just stopped at my door?
046.024 --Certainly, Excellency, they are even very beautiful.
046.025 --How is it," said Monte Cristo, frowning, "that when I asked you for the two most beautiful horses in Paris, there are two other horses in Paris as beautiful as mine, and that these horses are not in my stables?
046.026 At the frown and stern intonation of this voice, Ali lowered his head.
046.027 "It is not your fault, good Ali," said the Count in Arabic with a gentleness that one would not have thought possible to find either in his voice or on his face; "you don't know yourself about English horses, you."
046.028 Serenity returned to Ali's features.
046.029 "Mr. Count," said Bertuccio, "the horses of which you speak were not for sale.
046.030 Monte Cristo shrugged his shoulders:
046.031 "Know, Mr. Intendant, that everything is always for sale for those who know how to put a price on it.
046.032 --Mr. Danglars paid sixteen thousand francs for them, Monsieur le Comte.
046.033 -- Well, he should have been offered thirty-two thousand; he is a banker, and a banker never misses an opportunity to double his capital.
046.034 -Is the Count talking seriously?" asked Bertuccio.
046.035 Monte Cristo looked at the steward in astonishment that anyone would dare to ask him a question.
046.036 "Tonight," he said, "I have a visit to make; I want these two horses hitched to my carriage with new harness."
046.037 Bertuccio retired with a bow; near the door he stopped:
046.038 "At what hour," he said, "does His Excellency intend to make this visit?
046.039 -- At five o'clock," said Monte Cristo.
046.040 -- I will point out to Your Excellency that it is two o'clock," ventured the intendant.
046.041 --I know that," replied Monte Cristo.
046.042 Then turning to Ali, he said
046.043 "Pass all the horses before madame," he said, "let her choose the carriage that will suit her best, and let me know if she wants to dine with me: in that case we will serve at her house; go; when you come down, you will send me the valet."
046.044 Ali had scarcely disappeared, when the valet entered in his turn.
046.045 "Monsieur Baptistin," said the Count, "for a year you have been in my service; that is the time of trial which I usually impose on my people: you suit me."
046.046 Baptistin bowed.
046.047 "It remains to be seen whether I am suitable for you.
046.048 --Oh! Monsieur le Comte!" said Baptistin hastily.
046.049 --Listen to the end," continued the Count. You earn fifteen hundred francs a year, that is, the salary of a good and brave officer who risks his life every day; you have a table such as many office managers, unfortunate servants infinitely busier than you, would desire. As a domestic, you yourself have servants who take care of your clothes and your belongings. In addition to your fifteen hundred francs in wages, you rob me, on the purchases you make for my toilet, of about fifteen hundred other francs a year.
046.050 --Oh! Excellency!
046.051 -- I'm not complaining, Mr. Baptistin, it's reasonable; however, I want it to stop there. You would not find anywhere a position like the one your good fortune has given you. I never beat my people, I never swear, I never get angry, I always forgive a mistake, never a negligence or an oversight. My orders are usually short, but clear and precise; I prefer to repeat them twice and even three times, than to have them misinterpreted. I am rich enough to know everything I want to know, and I am very curious, I warn you. If I learned that you had spoken well or badly of me, commented on my actions, or watched my conduct, you would leave my house at once. I never warn my servants but once; you are warned, go!"
046.052 Baptistin bowed and took three or four steps to withdraw.
046.053 "By the way," continued the Count, "I forgot to tell you that every year I place a certain sum on the heads of my people. Those whom I send away necessarily lose this money, which benefits those who remain and who will be entitled to it after my death. You have been with me a year, your fortune has begun, continue it."
046.054 This address, made before Ali, who remained impassive, since he could not hear a word of French, produced an effect on M. Baptistin which will be understood by all who have studied the psychology of the French servant.
046.055 "I shall try to conform in every respect to Your Excellency's wishes," he said; "besides, I shall model myself on Mr. Ali.
046.056 --Oh, not at all," said the Count with a coldness of marble. Ali has many faults mingled with his qualities; so do not take your example from him, for Ali is an exception; he has no wages, he is not a servant, he is my slave, he is my dog; if he failed in his duty, I would not chase him away, he I would kill."
046.057 Baptistin opened his eyes wide.
046.058 "You doubt?" said Monte Cristo.
046.059 And he repeated to Ali the same words he had just said in French to Baptistin.
046.060 Ali listened, smiled, approached his master, put a knee to the ground, and respectfully kissed his hand.
046.061 This little corollary of the lesson put the finishing touches to Mr. Baptistin's amazement.
046.062 The Count signaled to Baptistin to leave, and to Ali to follow him. Both went into his study, and there they talked for a long time.
046.063 At five o'clock the Count struck three blows on his bell. One stroke called Ali, two strokes Baptistin, three strokes Bertuccio.
046.064 The steward entered.
046.065 "My horses!" said Monte Cristo.
046.066 --They are in the carriage, Excellency, replied Bertuccio. I will accompany His Lordship?
046.067 -- No, the coachman, Baptistin and Ali, that is all."
046.068 The count dismounted and saw harnessed to his carriage the horses he had admired in the morning at Danglars' carriage.
046.069 Passing by them he glanced at them.
046.070 "They are beautiful, indeed," he said, "and you did well to buy them, only it was a little late.
046.071 --Excellence, said Bertuccio, I had a lot of trouble getting them, and they cost a lot.
046.072 --Are the horses any less beautiful? asked the Count, shrugging his shoulders.
046.073 - "If Your Excellency is satisfied," said Bertuccio, "everything is fine. Where is Your Excellency going?
046.074 --Rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin, at the home of Baron Danglars."
046.075 This conversation took place on the top of the stoop. Bertuccio took a step to descend the first step.
046.076 "Wait, sir," said Monte Cristo, stopping him. I need a piece of land by the sea, in Normandy, for example, between Le Havre and Boulogne. I give you space, as you see. In this acquisition, there should be a small harbor, a small cove, a small bay, where my corvette can enter and stand; it only draws fifteen feet of water. The ship will always be ready to put to sea, at any time of the day or night that it pleases me to give her the signal. You will inquire at all the notaries about a property under the conditions I am explaining to you; when you have knowledge of it, you will go and visit it, and if you are satisfied, you will buy it in your name. The corvette must be on its way to Fécamp, right?
046.077 --The same evening we left Marseille, I saw her put to sea.
046.078 --And the yacht?
046.079 --The yacht has orders to remain in Martigues.
046.080 --Good! You will correspond from time to time with the two patrons who command them, so that they do not fall asleep.
046.081 --And for the steamboat?
046.082 --Who is in Chalons?
046.083 --Yes.
046.084 --Same orders as for the two sailing ships.
046.085 --Good!
046.086 --As soon as this property is purchased, I will have relays from ten leagues to ten leagues on the northern road and on the southern road.
046.087 --Your Excellency can count on me."
046.088 The count made a sign of satisfaction, descended the steps, jumped into his carriage, which, driven at the trot of the magnificent carriage, only stopped in front of the banker's hotel. Danglars was presiding over a commission appointed for a railroad, when he was told of the visit of the Count of Monte Cristo. The meeting, moreover, was almost over.
046.089 In the name of the Count, he rose.
046.090 "Gentlemen," he said, addressing his colleagues, several of whom were honorable members of one or the other House, "forgive me if I leave you like this; but imagine that the house of Thomson and French, of Rome, sends me a certain Count of Monte Cristo, opening up to him an unlimited credit. This is the funniest joke that my foreign correspondents have ever allowed themselves to play on me. My goodness, you understand, curiosity seized me and still holds me; I passed this morning at the pretended count's house. If he were a real count, you understand that he would not be so rich. Sir was not visible. What do you think of it? Are these not the manners of a highness or a pretty woman that Master Monte Cristo gives himself there? Besides, the house situated in the Champs-Élysées and which is his, I was informed, seemed to me clean. But an unlimited credit, resumed Danglars by laughing of his ugly smile, makes quite demanding the banker with whom the credit is opened. I am thus impatient to see our man. I believe myself mystified. But they don't know over there who they are dealing with; he who laughs last will laugh."
046.091 Completing these words and giving them an emphasis that swelled the nostrils of Mr. Baron, he left his hosts and passed into a white and gold salon that made a great noise in the Chaussée-d'Antin.
046.092 It was there that he had ordered to introduce the visitor to dazzle him at first sight.
046.093 The Count was standing, considering some copies of the Albane and the Fattore that the banker had been led to believe were originals, and which, copies though they were, swore strongly with the gold chicory of all colors that lined the ceilings.
046.094 At the noise that Danglars made as he entered, the count turned around.
046.095 Danglars nodded slightly, and motioned to the Count to sit down in a gilded wooden chair upholstered in white satin embroidered with gold.
046.096 The Count sat down.
046.097 "It is to Monsieur de Monte Cristo that I have the honor of speaking?
046.098 --And I," replied the Count, "to Monsieur Baron Danglars, Knight of the Legion of Honor, member of the Chamber of Deputies?"
046.099 Monte-Cristo repeated all the titles he had found on the baron's card.
046.100 Danglars felt the boot and bit his lips.
046.101 "Excuse me, sir," he said, "for not having given you at once the title under which you were announced to me; but, as you know, we live under a popular government, and I am a representative of the people's interests.
046.102 -So, replied Monte Cristo, that, while you have retained the habit of calling yourself a baron, you have lost the habit of calling others a count.
046.103 --Ah! I don't even care about myself, sir," replied Danglars carelessly; "they have named me a baron and made me a knight of the Legion of Honor for some services rendered, but ....
046.104 --But you have abdicated your titles, as MM. de Montmorency and Lafayette did in the past? It was a fine example to follow, sir.
046.105 --Not quite, however, Danglars continued embarrassed; for the servants, you understand....
046.106 --Yes, you call yourself monseigneur to your people; to journalists, you call yourself monsieur; and to your constituents, citoyen. These are nuances very applicable to constitutional government. I understand perfectly."
046.107 Danglars pursed his lips: he saw that, on that ground, he was not in strength with Monte Cristo, so he tried to return to a ground that was more familiar to him.
046.108 "Monsieur le Comte," he said, bowing, "I have received a letter of advice from the house of Thomson and French.
046.109 --I am charmed, Monsieur le Baron. Allow me to treat you as you treat your people, it is a bad habit taken in countries where there are still barons, precisely because one does not make any more. I am charmed, I said; I will not need to introduce myself, which is always rather embarrassing. So you said you had received a letter of notice?
046.110 -- Yes, said Danglars; but I confess that I did not fully understand its meaning.
046.111 --Bah!
046.112 --And I even had the honor of coming to your house to ask you for some explanations.
046.113 --Do, sir, here I am, I am listening and ready to hear you.
046.114 --This letter, said Danglars, I have it on me, I believe (he rummaged in his pocket). Yes, here it is: this letter opens to M. le Comte de Monte-Cristo an unlimited credit on my house.
046.115 --Well, Mr. Baron, what do you see in this that is obscure?
046.116 --Nothing, sir; only the word "unlimited"...
046.117 --Well, isn't that word French? You understand, it is Anglo-Germans who write.
046.118 --Oh, yes, sir, and there is nothing wrong with the syntax, but not with the accounting.
046.119 -- "Is the Thomson and French house," asked Monte Cristo, with the most naive air he could muster, "not perfectly safe, in your opinion, Monsieur le Baron?" "Hell, that would upset me, for I have some funds placed with it.
046.120 --Ah! perfectly safe, replied Danglars with an almost mocking smile; but the meaning of the word unlimited, in matters of finance, is so vague ....
046.121 --That it is unlimited, is it not?" said Monte Cristo.
046.122 --That is precisely what I meant, sir. Now, vagueness is doubt, and, says the wise man, in doubt abstain.
046.123 --This means, Monte Cristo continued, that if the house of Thomson and French is willing to do foolish things, the house of Danglars is not willing to follow its example.
046.124 --How so, sir count?
046.125 -- Yes, no doubt, Messrs. Thomson and French do business without figures; but Mr. Danglars has a limit to his; he is a wise man, as he said just now.
046.126 --Monsieur," the banker replied proudly, "no one has yet counted with my cash.
046.127 --So, Monte Cristo replied coldly, it seems that it is I who will start.
046.128 -- Who tells you that?
046.129 --The explanations you ask me for, sir, which look very much like hesitations..."
046.130 Danglars bit his lips; it was the second time he had been beaten by this man and this time on a ground that was his own. His mocking politeness was only affected, and touched on that extreme so near which is impertinence.
046.131 Monte Cristo, on the other hand, smiled with the best grace in the world, and possessed, when he wanted to, a certain naive air which gave him many advantages.
046.132 "Finally, sir," said Danglars after a moment's silence, "I will try to make myself understood by asking you to fix yourself the sum you intend to receive from me.
046.133 "But, sir," resumed Monte Cristo, determined not to lose an inch of ground in the discussion, "if I asked for unlimited credit on you, it was because I did not know precisely what sums I would need."
046.134 The banker thought that the moment had come at last to gain the upper hand; he fell back in his chair, and with a heavy, proud smile:
046.135 "Oh, sir," he said, "do not fear to desire; you will be able to convince yourself then that the figure of the Danglars house, limited as it is, can satisfy the widest demands, and even if you ask for a million....
046.136 -- Is that enough?" said Monte Cristo.
046.137 --I say a million, repeated Danglars with the aplomb of stupidity.
046.138 --And what would I do with a million? I am not sure that I would have been able to get a credit for such a miserable situation if I had only needed a million. A million? but I always have a million in my wallet or in my travel kit.
046.139 And Monte Cristo withdrew from a small notebook in which were his business cards two bonds of five hundred thousand francs each, payable to the bearer, on the Treasury.
046.140 A man like Danglars had to be stunned, not pricked. The blow of the sledgehammer had its effect: the banker staggered and became dizzy; he opened two dazed eyes on Monte Cristo, whose prism dilated frightfully.
046.141 "Let me see, confess to me," said Monte Cristo, "that you distrust the house of Thomson and French. My God! it is very simple; I foresaw the case, and, though a stranger to business, I took my precautions. Here are two other letters similar to the one addressed to you, one from the house of Arestein and Eskoles, of Vienna, about Mr. Baron de Rothschild, the other from the house of Baring, of London, about Mr. Laffitte. Say a word, sir, and I will take away all your concern, by introducing myself in either of these two houses."
046.142 It was done, Danglars was defeated; he opened with visible trembling the Vienna letter and the London letter, which the count held out to him with his fingertips, checked the authenticity of the signatures with a thoroughness which would have been insulting to Monte Cristo, if he had not made out the misguidedness of the banker.
046.143 "Oh, sir, here are three signatures worth millions," said Danglars, rising as if to salute the power of gold personified in this man before him. Three unlimited credits on our houses! Forgive me, Monsieur le Comte, but while ceasing to be defiant, one can still remain astonished.
046.144 --Oh! it is not a house like yours that would be so astonished, said Monte Cristo with all his politeness; so you will be able to send me some money, won't you?
046.145 --Speak up, Count; I am at your command.
046.146 --Well," said Monte Cristo, "now that we get along, for we do get along, don't we?
046.147 Danglars nodded in the affirmative.
046.148 "And you have no more distrust?" continued Monte Cristo.
046.149 --Oh! Monsieur le Comte!" exclaimed the banker, "I have never had any.
046.150 -- No; you wanted proof, that is all. I have never had one," said the banker, "but I have never had one." "You wanted proof, that's all." "Well," said the count, "now that we are getting along, now that you have no more doubts, let's fix a general sum for the first year, six millions, for example.
046.151 --Six million, either!
046.152 - "If I need more," said Monte Cristo mechanically, "we'll put in more; but I intend to stay only one year in France, and during that year I don't think I'll exceed that figure... well, we'll see.... Please, to begin with, have me bring five hundred thousand francs tomorrow, I will be at home until noon, and besides, if I were not there, I would leave a receipt with my steward.
046.153 -The money will be at your house tomorrow at ten o'clock in the morning, Monsieur le Comte, replied Danglars. Do you want gold, or bank bills, or money?
046.154 --Gold and banknotes by half, please.
046.155 And the Count rose.
046.156 "I must confess one thing to you, Monsieur le Comte," said Danglars in his turn; "I thought I had exact knowledge of all the fine fortunes of Europe, and yet yours, which seems to me considerable, was, I confess, quite unknown to me; it is recent?
046.157 -- "No, sir," replied Monte Cristo, "on the contrary, it is of very old date: it was a sort of family treasure which it was forbidden to touch, and whose accumulated interest has tripled the capital; the time fixed by the testator has been over for only a few years: it is therefore only for a few years that I have been using it, and your ignorance on this subject is only natural; besides, you will know it better in a little while.
046.158 And the Count accompanied these words with one of those pale smiles which so frightened Franz d'Épinay.
046.159 "With your tastes and your intentions, sir," continued Danglars, "you are going to display in the capital a luxury that will crush all of us, poor little millionaires: however, since you seem to me to be an amateur, for when I came in you were looking at my paintings, I ask your permission to show you my gallery: all old paintings, all paintings by masters guaranteed to be such; I do not like modern ones.
046.160 -- You are right, sir, for they generally have a great defect: it is that they have not yet had time to become old.
046.161 --May I show you some statues by Thorwaldsen, Bartoloni, Canova, all foreign artists? As you see, I do not appreciate French artists.
046.162 --You have the right to be unfair to them, sir, they are your countrymen.
046.163 --But all that will be for later, when we have made a better acquaintance, for today I will content myself, if you will allow me, with introducing you to Baroness Danglars; excuse my haste, Monsieur le Comte, but a client like you is almost part of the family."
046.164 Monte Cristo bowed, as a sign that he accepted the honor that the financier was willing to do him.
046.165 Danglars rang the bell; a lackey, dressed in bright livery, appeared.
046.166 "Is the baroness at home?" asked Danglars.
046.167 --Yes, Monsieur le Baron," answered the lackey.
046.168 --Alone?
046.169 -- No, madame has people.
046.170 --It won't be indiscreet to introduce you to anyone, will it, sir count? You do not keep incognito?
046.171 -- No, Monsieur le Baron," said Monte Cristo, smiling, "I do not recognize that right.
046.172 --And who is near madame? Mr. Debray?" asked Danglars with a bonhomie which made Monte-Cristo smile inwardly, already informed about the transparent interior secrets of the financier.
046.173 "Mr. Debray, yes, Mr. Baron," answered the lackey.
046.174 Danglars nodded.
046.175 Then turning to Monte Cristo:
046.176 "M. Lucien Debray," he said, "is an old friend of ours, an intimate secretary of the Minister of the Interior; as for my wife, she derogated by marrying me, for she belongs to an old family, she is a demoiselle de Servières, widow in the first marriage of M. the colonel marquis de Nargonne.
046.177 --I do not have the honor of knowing Madame Danglars; but I have already met Mr. Lucien Debray.
046.178 --Bah! said Danglars, where then?
046.179 --At M. de Morcerf's.
046.180 --Ah! you know the little viscount, said Danglars.
046.181 --We were together in Rome at the time of the carnival.
046.182 --Ah! yes, said Danglars; have I not heard of something like a singular adventure with bandits, thieves in the ruins? He was pulled out of there miraculously. I believe he told something of all this to my wife and daughter on his return from Italy.
046.183 --Ms. the Baroness is waiting for these gentlemen, the lackey returned to say.
046.184 --I'll go ahead and show you the way," said Danglars, saluting.
046.185 --And I follow you," said Monte Cristo.
047.000 The dappled gray carriage.
047. 001 The baron, followed by the count, crossed a long line of apartments remarkable by their heavy sumptuousness and their sumptuous bad taste, and arrived until the boudoir of Mrs. Danglars, small octagonal room tended of pink satin covered with muslin of the Indies; the armchairs were out of old gilded wood and old fabrics; the tops of the doors represented sheepfolds in the style of Boucher; finally two pretty pastels in medallion, in harmony with the remainder of the furnishing, made of this small room the only one of the hotel which had some character; it is true that it had escaped the general plan decided between M. It is true that it had escaped the general plan agreed upon between M. Danglars and his architect, one of the highest and most eminent celebrities of the Empire, and that it was the baroness and Lucien Debray alone who had reserved the decoration for themselves. Also M. Danglars, a great admirer of the antique in the way the Directory understood it, greatly despised this coquettish little room, where, moreover, he was generally admitted only on the condition that he would have his presence excused by bringing someone; it was not, therefore, in reality Danglars who was presenting, it was on the contrary he who was presented and who was well or badly received according to whether the visitor's face was pleasant or unpleasant to the baroness.
047.002 Mrs. Danglars, whose beauty could still be cited, in spite of her thirty-six years, was at her piano, a small masterpiece of marquetry, while Lucien Debray, seated in front of a work table, was leafing through an album.
047.003 Lucien had already, before his arrival, had time to tell the baroness many things about the count. It is known how much, during lunch at Albert's, Monte Cristo had made an impression on his guests; this impression, however unimpressive he was, had not yet been erased at Debray's, and the information he had given the baroness about the count had been affected by it. The curiosity of Mme. Danglars, excited by the old details from Morcerf and the new details from Lucien, was thus brought to its height. Also this arrangement of piano and album was only one of those little tricks of the world with the help of which one veils the strongest precautions. The baroness accordingly received Mr. Danglars with a smile, which was not usual for her. As for the count, he had, in return for his greeting, a ceremonious but at the same time gracious curtsy.
047.004 Lucien, for his part, exchanged with the Count a greeting of half-knowledge, and with Danglars a gesture of intimacy.
047.005 "Madame la baronne," said Danglars, "allow me to present to you M. The Count of Monte Cristo, who has been sent to me by my correspondents in Rome with the most urgent recommendations: I have only one word to say about him, and that is to make him in an instant the darling of all our beautiful ladies; he is coming to Paris with the intention of staying there a year and spending six millions during that year; that promises a series of balls, dinners, and medianoches, in which I hope that M. the count will not forget us any more than we will forget him ourselves in our little parties."
047.006 Although the introduction was rather grossly laudatory, it is, in general, so rare a thing for a man to come to Paris to spend in one year the fortune of a prince, that Mme. Danglars cast a glance at the count which was not without a certain interest.
047.007 "And you have arrived, sir?" asked the baroness.
047.008 --Since yesterday morning, madam.
047.009 --And you have come, as is your wont, I am told, from the end of the world?
047.010 --From Cadiz this time, madam, pure and simple.
047.011 --Oh! you have arrived in a dreadful season. Paris is hateful in summer; there are no more balls, reunions, or parties. The Italian Opera is in London, the French Opera is everywhere, except in Paris; and as for the Théâtre-Français, you know that it is nowhere to be seen. We are left, therefore, with a few unfortunate errands to the Champ-de-Mars and to Satory. Will you make us run, Monsieur le Comte?
047.012 - "I, madam," said Monte Cristo, "will do everything that is done in Paris, if I have the good fortune to find someone who can inform me properly about French habits.
047.013 --Are you a horse lover, Monsieur le Comte?
047.014 -- I spent part of my life in the Orient, Madame, and the Orientals, as you know, only value two things in the world: the nobility of horses and the beauty of women.
047.015 --Ah! Mr. Count, said the baroness, you should have had the gallantry to put the women first.
047.016 --You see, madam, that I was quite right when just now I wished for a tutor who could guide me in French habits."
047.017 At this moment the favorite chambermaid of Madame Baroness Danglars entered, and approaching her mistress, slipped a few words into her ear.
047.018 Mrs. Danglars turned pale.
047.019 "Impossible!" she said.
047.020 --That is the exact truth, however, madam," replied the chambermaid.
047.021 Mrs. Danglars turned to her husband's side.
047.022 "Is that true, sir?
047.023 --What, madame?" asked Danglars, visibly agitated.
047.024 --What this girl says to me....
047.025 --And what is she saying to you?
047.026 --She tells me that when my coachman went to put my horses in my carriage, he did not find them in the stable; what does that mean, I ask you?
047.027 --Madam, said Danglars, listen to me.
047.028 --Oh, I am listening to you, sir, for I am curious to know what you are going to tell me; I will make these gentlemen judges between us, and I will begin by telling them what it is. I will make these gentlemen judges between us, and I will begin by telling them what it is. "Gentlemen," continued the baroness, "Baron Danglars has ten horses in the stable; among these ten horses, there are two that are mine, charming horses, the most beautiful horses in Paris; you know them, Monsieur Debray, my dappled grays! Well, at the moment when Mme. de Villefort borrows my carriage, when I promise it to her to go to the Bois tomorrow, there are the two horses which are no longer to be found! M. Danglars will have found a few thousand francs to earn on them, and he will have sold them. Oh, what a vile race, my God! that of speculators!
047.029 --Madame, replied Danglars, the horses were too lively, they were barely four years old, they gave me horrible fears for you.
047.030 --Eh! sir, said the baroness, you know very well that I have had the best coachman in Paris in my service for a month, unless, however, you have sold him with the horses.
047.031 - "Dear friend, I will find you the same horses, even more beautiful ones, if there are any; but gentle, calm horses, which no longer inspire me with the same terror.
047.032 The baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of profound contempt. Danglars did not seem to notice this more than conjugal gesture, and turning back to Monte Cristo:
047.033 "In truth, I regret not having known you sooner, Monsieur le Comte," he said; "you are going up to your house?
047.034 --But yes, said the Count.
047.035 --I would have offered them to you. Imagine that I gave them to you for nothing, but, as I told you, I wanted to get rid of them: they are young men's horses.
047.036 --Sir, said the count, I thank you; I bought some this morning, quite good and not too expensive. Here, see, Monsieur Debray, you are an amateur, I believe?"
047.037 While Debray approached the window, Danglars came up to his wife.
047.038 "Imagine, madam," he told her softly, "that someone has come to offer me an exorbitant price for these horses. I don't know what madman is ruining himself who sent his steward to me this morning, but the fact is that I have earned sixteen thousand francs on them; don't sulk to me, and I will give you four thousand, and two thousand to Eugenie."
047.039 Mme. Danglars let a crushing look fall on her husband.
047.040 "Oh, my God!" cried Debray.
047.041 --What on earth?" asked the baroness.
047.042 --But I am not mistaken, they are your horses, your own horses hitched to the Count's carriage.
047.043 --My dapple-gray ones!" cried Mrs. Danglars.
047.044 And she rushed to the window.
047.045 "Indeed, it is them," she said.
047.046 Danglars was stunned.
047.047 "Is it possible?" said Monte-Cristo, acting astonished.
047.048 "It is incredible!" murmured the banker.
047.049 The baroness said two words in the ear of Debray, who in turn approached Monte-Cristo.
047.050 "The baroness wants you to ask how much her husband sold you his carriage.
047.051 -But I don't know," said the Count, "it's a surprise my steward gave me, and... it cost me thirty thousand francs, I think."
047.052 Debray went to report the answer to the baroness.
047.053 Danglars was so pale and disconcerted that the Count seemed to take pity on him.
047.054 "See," he said to him, "how ungrateful women are: this thoughtfulness on your part has not touched the baroness for a moment; ungrateful is not the word, it is madness that I should say. But what do you want, one always likes what harms; also, the shortest way, believe me, dear baron, is always to let them do as they please; if they break it, at least, my goodness! they can only blame themselves."
047.055 Danglars answered nothing, he foresaw in the near future a disastrous scene; already the eyebrow of Mme. the baroness had frowned, and like that of Olympian Jupiter, presaged a storm; Debray, who felt it growing, pretexted an affair and left. Monte-Cristo, who did not want to spoil the position he wanted to conquer by staying longer, saluted Mme. Danglars and withdrew, leaving the baron to the anger of his wife.
047.056 "Good!" thought Monte-Cristo as he withdrew, "I have arrived where I wanted to come; here I hold in my hands the peace of the household and I am going to win at once the heart of monsieur and the heart of madame; what happiness! But," he added, "in all this, I have not been introduced to Miss Eugenie Danglars, whom I would have been very happy to know. But," he continued with that smile which was peculiar to him, "here we are in Paris, and we have time to spare.... It will be for later!
047.057 On this reflection, the count got into his car and returned home.
047.058 Two hours later, Madame Danglars received a charming letter from the Count of Monte Cristo, in which he told her that, not wanting to begin his debut in the Parisian world by despairing of a pretty woman, he begged her to take his horses back.
047.059 They had the same harness that she had seen them wear in the morning; only in the center of each rosette that they wore on their ears, the Count had had a diamond sewn on.
047.060 Danglars, too, had his letter.
047.061 The Count asked his permission to pass on to the Baroness this millionaire's whim, asking him to excuse the oriental manner with which the dismissal of the horses was accompanied.
047.062 During the evening, Monte-Cristo left for Auteuil, accompanied by Ali.
047.063 The next day around three o'clock, Ali, called by a stamp, entered the Count's office.
047.064 "Ali," he said to him, "you have often spoken to me of your skill in throwing the lasso?"
047.065 Ali nodded and stood up proudly.
047.066 "Good! So, with the lasso, you would stop an ox?"
047.067 Ali nodded his head yes.
047.068 "A tiger?"
047.069 Ali made the same sign.
047.070 "A lion?"
047.071 Ali made the gesture of a man throwing the lasso, and imitated a strangled roar.
047.072 "Well, I understand," said Monte Cristo, "did you hunt the lion?"
047.073 Ali nodded proudly.
047.074 "But would you stop, in their race, two horses?"
047.075 Ali smiled.
047.076 "Well, listen," said Monte Cristo. Just now a carriage will pass carried by two dapple-gray horses, the same ones I had yesterday. Even if you get run over, you must stop this carriage in front of my door."
047.077 Ali went down to the street and drew a line on the pavement in front of the door: then he returned and showed the line to the count, who had followed him with his eyes.
047.078 The Count gently tapped him on the shoulder: it was his way of thanking Ali. Then the Nubian went to smoke his shibboleth on the post which formed the corner of the house and the street, while Monte Cristo returned without taking any further notice.
047.079 However, at about five o'clock, the time when the Count was waiting for the carriage, one could have seen in him the almost imperceptible signs of a slight impatience: he was walking around a room overlooking the street, lending his ear at intervals, and from time to time approaching the window, through which he saw Ali puffing tobacco with a regularity indicating that the Nubian was all at this important occupation.
047.080 Suddenly a distant roll was heard, but it was approaching with the rapidity of lightning; then a carriage appeared, whose driver was trying uselessly to hold back the horses, which were advancing furiously, bristling, leaping with insane impetus.
047.081 In the carriage, a young woman and a child of seven or eight years, holding each other in their arms, had lost by the excess of terror even the strength to utter a cry; it would have been enough for a stone under the wheel or a hanging tree to break the carriage completely, which cracked. The car stood in the middle of the pavement, and the cries of terror of those who saw it coming could be heard in the street.
047.082 Suddenly Ali put down his chibouque, drew from his pocket the lasso, threw it, wrapped a triple turn around the front legs of the left horse, let himself be carried away three or four steps by the violence of the impulse; but, at the end of three or four steps, the chained horse fell down, fell on the arrow, which it broke, and paralyzed the efforts made by the horse that had remained upright to continue its race. The coachman seizes this moment of respite to jump down from his seat; but already Ali has seized the nostrils of the second horse with his iron fingers, and the animal, neighing with pain, has laid down convulsively near his companion.
047.083 All this took as long as it takes for the ball to hit the goal.
047.084 However, it was enough that from the house in front of which the accident happened, a man ran out followed by several servants. At the moment when the coachman opened the door, he took from the carriage the lady, who with one hand clung to the cushion, while with the other she clutched her fainting son to her breast. Monte Cristo carried them both into the salon, and laid them on a sofa:
047.085 "Fear no more, madam," he said; "you are saved."
047.086 The woman came back to her, and for answer she presented her son to him, with a look more eloquent than all prayers.
047.087 Indeed, the child was still passed out.
047.088 "Yes, madam, I understand," said the Count, examining the child; "but, rest assured, no harm has come to him, and it is only fear that has put him in this state.
047.089 --Oh, sir," cried the mother, "are you not telling me this to reassure me? See how pale he is! My son, my child, my Edward, answer your mother! Ah, sir, send for a doctor. My fortune to whom I can get my son back!"
047.090 Monte Cristo made a gesture with his hand to calm the grieving mother; and, opening a case, he drew from it a Bohemian flask, inlaid with gold, containing a liquor as red as blood, and of which he let a single drop fall on the child's lips.
047.091 The child, though still pale, immediately opened his eyes again.
047.092 At this sight, the mother's joy was almost delirious.
047.093 "Where am I?" she cried, "and to whom do I owe so much happiness after such a cruel trial?
047.094 -- "You are, madam," replied Monte Cristo, "in the home of the happiest man to have been able to spare you a sorrow.
047.095 --Oh! cursed curiosity! said the lady. All Paris was talking about these magnificent horses of Madame Danglars, and I was foolish enough to want to try them.
047.096 --How!" exclaimed the Count with admirably played surprise, "are these the Baroness's horses?
047.097 --Yes, sir, do you know her?
047.098 --Mrs. Danglars?... I have this honor, and my joy is doubled to see you saved from the peril that these horses have caused you; for this peril, it is to me that you could have attributed it: I had bought these horses yesterday from the baron; but the baroness seemed to regret them so much, that I sent them back to her yesterday, begging her to accept them from me.
047.099 --But then you are the Count of Monte Cristo of whom Hermine spoke so much yesterday?
047.100 --Yes, madam, said the Count.
047.101 --Moi, monsieur, je suis Mme Héloïse de Villefort."
047.102 The count saluted like a man before whom one pronounces a perfectly unknown name.
047.103 "Oh, how grateful M. de Villefort will be!" resumed Heloise, "for at last he will owe you both our lives: you have given him back his wife and his son. Surely, without your generous servant, this dear child and I would have been killed.
047.104 -- Alas, madam, I still shudder at the danger you have run.
047.105 --Oh, I hope you will allow me to reward this man's devotion with dignity.
047.106 --Madam, replied Monte Cristo, do not spoil Ali, I beg you, either by praise or by rewards: these are habits I do not want him to adopt. Ali is my slave; by saving your life he serves me, and it is his duty to serve me.
047.107 --But he has risked his life, said Mme de Villefort, to whom this masterly tone was singularly imposing.
047.108 -- "I saved that life, madame," replied Monte Cristo, "and therefore it belongs to me.
047.109 Mme. de Villefort was silent: perhaps she was reflecting on this man who, at first sight, made such a deep impression on the mind.
047.110 During this moment of silence, the count could consider at his ease the child whom his mother was covering with kisses. He was small, frail, white of skin like the red-haired children, and yet a forest of black hair, rebellious to any curl, covered his bulging forehead, and, falling on his shoulders and framing his face, redoubled the vivacity of his eyes full of sly malice and juvenile wickedness; his mouth, hardly turned ruddy again, was fine of lips and wide of opening; the features of this child of eight years already announced twelve years at least. His first movement was to shake himself out of his mother's arms, and to go and open the box from which the Count had taken the elixir bottle; then at once, without asking anyone's permission, and like a child accustomed to satisfying all his whims, he began to uncork the vials.
047.111 "Don't touch that, my friend," said the Count sharply, "some of these liquors are dangerous, not only to drink, but even to breathe."
047.112 Mme. de Villefort paled and stopped her son's arm, which she brought back to her; but, her fear calmed, she immediately cast a short but expressive glance at the box, which the count seized in passing.
047.113 At this moment Ali entered.
047.114 Mme de Villefort made a movement of joy, and brought the child still closer to her:
047.115 "Edward," she said, "do you see this good servant: he has been very brave, for he exposed his life to stop the horses that were carrying us off and the carriage that was about to break down. Thank him, then, for probably without him, at this hour, we should both be dead."
047.116 The child stretched out his lips and turned his head disdainfully.
047.117 "He is too ugly," he said.
047.118 The Count smiled as if the child had just fulfilled one of his hopes; as for Mme de Villefort, she gloated at her son with a moderation that would certainly not have been to Jean-Jacques Rousseau's liking if little Édouard had been called Émile.
047.119 "You see," said the Count to Ali in Arabic, "this lady asks her son to thank you for the life you saved for them both, and the child replies that you are too ugly."
047.120 Ali turned his intelligent head away for a moment and looked at the child without apparent expression; but a mere quivering of his nostril told Monte Cristo that the Arab had just been wounded in the heart.
047.121 "Sir," asked Mme. de Villefort, rising to withdraw, "is this your usual home?
047.122 "No, madame," replied the Count, "it is a sort of pied-à-terre which I have bought: I live on the Avenue des Champs-Élysées, No. 30. But I see that you are quite recovered, and that you wish to retire. I have just ordered that these same horses be harnessed to my carriage, and Ali, that ugly boy," he said, smiling at the child, "will have the honor of driving you home, while your coachman will remain here to mend the carriage. As soon as this indispensable task is finished, one of my carriages will drive it directly to Mrs. Danglars.
047.123 --But, said Mme de Villefort, with these same horses I would never dare to go.
047.124 --Oh! you will see, madame," said Monte Cristo; "under Ali's hand they will become as gentle as lambs.
047.125 Indeed, Ali had approached the horses, which had been put back on their legs with great difficulty. He held in his hand a small sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar; he rubbed it into the nostrils and temples of the horses, which were covered with sweat and foam, and almost immediately they began to blow noisily and shiver with their whole bodies for a few seconds.
047. 126 Then, in the midst of a large crowd which the wreckage of the carriage and the noise of the event had attracted in front of the house, Ali harnessed the horses to the Count's coupé, gathered up the reins, climbed onto the seat, and, to the great astonishment of those present who had seen the horses carried away as if by a whirlwind, He was obliged to use the whip vigorously to make them go, and still he could only obtain from the famous dapple-gray horses, now stupid, petrified, dead, a trot so insecure and languid that it took Mme. de Villefort nearly two hours to get back to the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, where she lived.
047.127 As soon as she arrived home, and the first family emotions had subsided, she wrote the following bill to Madame Danglars:
047.128 "Dear Hermine,
047.129 "I have just been miraculously saved with my son by the same Count of Monte Cristo of whom we spoke so much last night, and whom I was far from suspecting that I would see today. Yesterday you spoke to me of him with an enthusiasm that I could not help but mock with all the strength of my poor little mind, but today I find this enthusiasm far below the man who inspired it. Your horses had run away to Ranelagh as if in a frenzy, and we were probably going to be torn to pieces, my poor Edward and I, against the first tree in the road or the first boundary marker in the village, when an Arab, a Negro, a Nubian, a black man at last, in the service of the Count, at a sign from him, I believe, stopped the momentum of the horses, at the risk of being broken himself, and it is really a miracle that he was not. Then the Count ran up, took me and Edward to his house, and there called my son back to life. I was taken back to the hotel in his own carriage; yours will be sent back to you tomorrow. You will find your horses quite weakened since this accident; they are as if dazed; it seems that they cannot forgive themselves for having let themselves be tamed by a man. The Count has instructed me to tell you that two days' rest on the litter and barley for food will restore them to a state as flourishing, which is to say as frightening, as yesterday.
047.130 "Goodbye! I do not thank you for my ride, and, when I reflect, it is ingratitude, however, to hold a grudge against you for the caprices of your carriage; for it is to one of these caprices that I owe the fact of having seen the Count of Monte Cristo, and the illustrious stranger seems to me, apart from the millions at his disposal, such a curious and interesting problem, that I intend to study him at all costs, even if I have to take another ride in the Bois with your own horses.
047.131 "Edward bore the accident with miraculous courage. He fainted, but he did not cry out before and did not shed a tear afterwards. You will tell me again that my maternal love blinds me; but there is a soul of iron in this poor little body so frail and delicate.
047.132 "Our dear Valentine says many things to your dear Eugenie; I embrace you with all my heart.
047.133 "HELOISE DE VILLEFORT."
047.134 "P.-S. Please have me come to your house in some way with this Count of Monte Cristo, I absolutely want to see him again. Besides, I have just obtained from M. de Villefort that he pay him a visit; I hope he will return it."
047.135 In the evening the event at Auteuil was the subject of all conversations: Albert told it to his mother, Château-Renaud to the Jockey-Club, Debray to the minister's salon; Beauchamp himself gave the count the gallantry, in his newspaper, of a _fait divers_ of twenty lines, which posed the noble stranger as a hero with all the women of the aristocracy.
047.136 Many people went to register with Mme. de Villefort in order to have the right to renew their visit in due course and then to hear from her all the details of this picturesque adventure.
047.137 As for M. de Villefort, as Heloise had said, he put on a black suit, white gloves, and his best livery, and got into his carriage, which came to a stop that same evening at the door of number 30 of the house on the Champs-Élysées.
048.000 Ideology.
048.001 If the Count of Monte Cristo had lived for a long time in the Parisian world, he would have appreciated in all its value the step that M. de Villefort made near him.
048.002 Well at court, whether the reigning king was of the elder or the younger branch, whether the governing minister was doctrinaire, liberal or conservative; reputedly skilful by all, as people who have never experienced political failure are generally reputed to be skilful; hated by many, but warmly protected by some without being loved by anyone, M. de Villefort held one of the high positions in the judiciary, and stood at that height like a Harlay or like a Molé. His salon, regenerated by a young woman and by a daughter from his first marriage barely eighteen years old, was no less one of those severe salons of Paris where the cult of tradition and the religion of etiquette are observed. Cold politeness, absolute fidelity to governmental principles, a profound contempt for theories and theorists, and a deep hatred of ideologues, such were the elements of M. de Villefort's interior and public life.
048.003 M. de Villefort was not only a magistrate, he was almost a diplomat. His relations with the old court, of which he always spoke with dignity and deference, made him respected by the new one, and he knew so many things that not only was he always spared, but he was also sometimes consulted. Perhaps it would not have been so if it had been possible to get rid of M. de Villefort; but he lived, like those feudal lords who rebel against their suzerain, in an impregnable fortress. This fortress was his office of King's prosecutor, of which he exploited all the advantages marvelously, and which he would have left only to be elected deputy and thus to replace neutrality by opposition.
048.004 In general, M. de Villefort made or returned few visits. His wife visited for him: this was accepted in the world, where one put on the account of the serious and numerous occupations of the magistrate what was in reality only a calculation of pride, only a quintessence of aristocracy, the application finally of this axiom: Pretend to esteem yourself, and you will be esteemed, an axiom more useful a hundred times in our society than that of the Greeks: Know thyself, replaced in our days by the less difficult and more advantageous art of knowing others.
048.005 To his friends, M. de Villefort was a powerful protector; to his enemies, he was a deaf but relentless adversary; to the indifferent, he was the statue of the law made man: haughty approach, impassive physiognomy, dull and frosted gaze, or insolently piercing and scrutinizing, such was the man whose four revolutions, skilfully piled one on top of the other, had first built and then cemented his pedestal.
048.006 M. de Villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the least commonplace man in France; he gave a ball every year and appeared there for only a quarter of an hour, that is to say forty-five minutes less than the king does to his own people; he was never seen either at the theaters, or at concerts, or in any public place, sometimes, but rarely, he played a game of whist, and care was taken to choose players worthy of him: It was some ambassador, some archbishop, some prince, some president, or finally some dowager duchess.
048.007 This was the man whose carriage had just stopped in front of Monte Cristo's door.
048.008 The valet announced M. de Villefort just as the Count, leaning over a large table, was following a map from St. Petersburg to China.
048.009 The king's prosecutor entered with the same grave and compact step as he entered the court; it was indeed the same man, or rather the continuation of the same man whom we saw formerly substitute in Marseille. Nature, consistent with its principles, had not changed anything for him in the course it had to follow. From thin, he had become thin, from pale he had become yellow; his sunken eyes were hollow, and his glasses with golden temples, resting on the orbit, seemed to be part of the figure; except for his white tie, the rest of his costume was perfectly black, and this funereal color was only cut by the slight border of red ribbon which passed imperceptibly through his buttonhole and which seemed like a line of blood drawn with a brush.
048.010 However self-controlled Monte Cristo was, he examined with visible curiosity, while returning his greeting, the magistrate who, defiant by habit and not very credulous especially as to social wonders, was more disposed to see in the noble stranger--that was how Monte Cristo was already called--a knight of industry coming to exploit a new theater, or a malefactor in a state of breach of ban, than a prince of the Holy See or a sultan of the _Mille et une Nuits_.
048.011 "Sir," said Villefort, with that yelping tone affected by magistrates in their oratory periods, and which they cannot or will not shake off in conversation, "the signal service you rendered yesterday to my wife and son makes it my duty to thank you. I have therefore come to discharge this duty and to express to you all my gratitude."
048.012 And, as he spoke these words, the stern eye of the magistrate had lost none of its usual arrogance. These words which he had just said, he had articulated them with his voice of a public prosecutor, with that inflexible stiffness of neck and shoulders which made, as we repeat, his flatterers say that he was the living statue of the law.
048.013 "Sir," replied the Count in his turn with icy coldness, "I am very happy to have been able to preserve a son for his mother, for it is said that the sentiment of maternity is the holiest of all, and this happiness which has befallen me dispenses you, sir, from fulfilling a duty, the performance of which undoubtedly honors me, for I know that M. de Villefort does not prodigy the favor he does for me, but which, however precious it may be, is not worth the satisfaction of the interior for me."
048.014 Villefort, astonished at this outburst, which he had not expected, flinched like a soldier who feels the blow dealt to him under the armor with which he is covered, and a crease in his disdainful lip indicated that from the first he did not regard the Count of Monte Cristo as a very civil gentleman.
048.015 He cast his eyes around him to pick up the fallen conversation, which seemed to have broken as it fell.
048.016 He saw the card that Monte Cristo had been questioning when he had entered, and he resumed:
048.017 "You are occupied with geography, sir? It is a rich study, especially for you who, as they say, have seen as many countries as are engraved on this atlas.
048.018 -- Yes, sir," replied the Count, "I wanted to do on the human species, taken en masse, what you practice every day on exceptions, that is, a physiological study. I thought it would be easier for me to go down from the whole to the part, than from the part to the whole. It is an algebraic axiom that one proceeds from the known to the unknown, and not from the unknown to the known.... But please sit down, sir, I beg you."
048. 019 And Monte-Cristo indicated with the hand to the prosecutor of the king an armchair which this one was obliged to take the sorrow to advance himself, while he had only that to let himself fall again in that on which he was kneeling when the prosecutor of the king had entered; In this way the Count found himself half turned towards his visitor, with his back to the window and his elbow resting on the map which was, for the moment, the object of the conversation, a conversation which took, as it had done at Morcerf's and Danglars', a turn quite analogous, if not to the situation, at least to the characters.
048.020 "Ah, you are philosophizing," resumed Villefort after a moment's silence, during which, like an athlete who meets a tough opponent, he had built up his strength. Well, sir, my word of honor! If, like you, I had nothing to do, I would seek a less sad occupation.
048.021 - "It is true, sir," resumed Monte Cristo, "and man is an ugly caterpillar for him who studies him under the solar microscope. But you have just said, I believe, that I had nothing to do. Let us see, by any chance, do you think you have anything to do, you, sir? or, to put it more plainly, do you think that what you do is worth calling something?"
048.022 Villefort's astonishment redoubled at this second blow so rudely delivered by this strange adversary; it had been a long time since the magistrate had heard himself say a paradox of this force, or rather, to speak more accurately, it was the first time he had heard it.
048.023 The king's prosecutor set about answering.
048.024 "Sir," he said, "you are a foreigner, and, as you yourself say, I believe, a portion of your life has been spent in oriental countries; you do not know, therefore, how much human justice, expeditious in those barbarous lands, has cautious and compassed allures here.
048.025 - So done, sir, so done; it is the ancient _pede claudo_. I know all this, for it is above all the justice of all countries that I have been concerned with, it is the criminal procedure of all nations that I have compared with natural justice; and, I must say, sir, it is still this law of the primitive peoples, that is, the law of retaliation, that I have found most in the heart of God.
048.026 - "If this law were adopted, sir," said the king's prosecutor, "it would greatly simplify our codes, and our magistrates would, as you said earlier, have very little to do.
048.027 -This will perhaps come, said Monte Cristo, you know that human inventions go from the compound to the simple, and that the simple is always the perfection.
048.028 -- In the meantime, sir, said the magistrate, our codes exist with their contradictory articles, drawn from Gallic customs, Roman laws, and Frankish usages; now, the knowledge of all these laws, you will agree, is not acquired without long work, and it takes long study to acquire this knowledge, and great power of mind, this knowledge once acquired, not to forget it.
048. 029 -- I am of that opinion, sir; but all that you know about this French code, I know about it, not only about the code of all nations: English, Turkish, Japanese, Hindu laws are as familiar to me as French laws; and so I was right in saying that, relatively (you know that everything is relative, sir), that relatively to all that I have done, you have very little to do, and that relatively to what I have learned, you still have many things to learn.
048.030 --But to what end have you learned all this?" continued Villefort in astonishment.
048.031 Monte Cristo smiled.
048.032 "Well, sir," he said; "I see that, in spite of the reputation you have been given of being a superior man, you see everything from the material and vulgar point of view of society, beginning with man and ending with man, that is to say, from the most restricted and narrowest point of view that human intelligence has been allowed to embrace.
048.033 --Explain yourself, sir," said Villefort, more and more astonished, "I don't understand you... very well.
048.034 -- I say, sir, that, with your eyes fixed on the social organization of nations, you see only the springs of the machine, and not the sublime worker who makes it act; I say that you recognize before you and around you only the holders of the positions whose patents have been signed by ministers or by a king, and that the men whom God has placed above the holders, the ministers and the kings, by giving them a mission to pursue instead of a place to fill, I say that these men escape your short sight. This is the characteristic of human weakness with debilitated and incomplete organs. Tobias took the angel who came to restore his sight for an ordinary young man. The nations took Attila, who was to annihilate them, for a conqueror like all conquerors, and it was necessary for all of them to reveal their celestial missions in order for them to be recognized; it was necessary for one to say, "I am the angel of the Lord," and the other, "I am the hammer of God," in order for the divine essence of both to be revealed.
048.035 - "So," said Villefort, more and more astonished, and believing himself to be talking to an enlightened man or a madman, "you see yourself as one of those extraordinary beings you have just mentioned?
048.036 --Why not? said Monte Cristo coldly.
048.037 - "I'm sorry, sir," said Villefort, dumbfounded, "but you'll excuse me if, in coming to your house, I didn't know I was coming to a man whose knowledge and whose mind go so far beyond the ordinary knowledge and mind of men. It is not the custom among us, unfortunate corrupts of civilization, that gentlemen possessing, as you do, an immense fortune, at least as far as one can tell, notice that I am not questioning, only repeating, it is not the custom, I say, that these privileged people of wealth waste their time in social speculations, in philosophical dreams, made at most to console those whom fate has deprived of the goods of the earth.
048.038 --Eh! sir," resumed the count, "have you thus arrived at the eminent position you occupy without having admitted, and even without having encountered exceptions, and do you never exercise your gaze, which would nevertheless be so much in need of finesse and certainty, to guess at once on which man your gaze has fallen? Shouldn't a magistrate be, not the best applicator of the law, not the most cunning interpreter of the obscurities of chicanery, but a steel probe to test hearts, but a touchstone to wipe the gold of which each soul is always made with more or less alloy?
048.039 --Monsieur, said Villefort, you confuse me, on my word, and I have never heard anyone speak as you do.
048.040 -It is that you have constantly remained enclosed in the circle of general conditions, and that you have never dared to lift yourself up with a flick of your wing into the higher spheres that God has populated with invisible or exceptional beings.
048.041 --And you admit, sir, that these spheres exist, and that exceptional and invisible beings mingle with us?
048.042 --Why not? Do you see the air that you breathe and without which you could not live?
048.043 --So we do not see these beings of which you speak?
048.044 -Yes, you see them when God allows them to materialize, you touch them, you bend them, you talk to them and they answer you.
048.045 --Ah!" said Villefort, smiling, "I confess that I would like to be warned when one of these beings comes into contact with me.
048.046 --You have been served as you please, sir; for you were warned just now, and now again I warn you.
048.047 --And so you?
048.048 -- I am one of those exceptional beings, yes, sir, and I believe that, until now, no man has found himself in a position similar to mine. The kingdoms of kings are limited, either by mountains or rivers, or by a change in morals, or by a mutation in language. My kingdom is as big as the world, because I am neither Italian, nor French, nor Hindu, nor American, nor Spanish: I am cosmopolitan. No country can say that it saw me being born. God only knows which country will see me die. I adopt all customs, I speak all languages. You think I'm French, don't you, because I speak French with the same ease and purity as you? well! Ali, my Nubian, believes me to be an Arab; Bertuccio, my steward, believes me to be a Roman; Haydée, my slave, believes me to be Greek. So you understand, being from no country, asking protection from no government, recognizing no man for my brother, not one of the scruples that stop the powerful or the obstacles that paralyze the weak paralyzes or stops me. I have only two adversaries; I will not say two victors, because with persistence I submit them: it is the distance and the time. The third, and most terrible, is my condition of mortal man. This alone can stop me in the path I am walking, and before I have reached the goal I am aiming at: everything else I have calculated. What men call the chances of fate, that is to say, ruin, change, eventualities, I have foreseen them all; and if some of them can reach me, none can overthrow me. Unless I die, I will always be what I am; that is why I tell you things that you have never heard, even from the mouths of kings, for kings need you and other men are afraid of you. Who is there who does not say to himself, in a society as ridiculously organized as ours, "Perhaps one day I will have to deal with the king's attorney!"
048.049 --But you yourself, sir, can say that, for, from the moment you live in France, you are naturally subject to French laws.
048.050 --I know that, sir," replied Monte Cristo; "but when I have to go to a country, I begin to study, by means of my own, all the men from whom I may have something to hope or fear, and I come to know them as well, and even better perhaps than they know themselves. This leads to the result that the king's prosecutor, whoever he might be, with whom I would have to deal, would certainly be more embarrassed than I am.
048.051 -That means," Villefort continued hesitantly, "that human nature being weak, every man, in your opinion, has committed faults?
048.052 --Faults... or crimes," replied Monte Cristo carelessly.
048.053 --And that you alone, among the men whom you do not recognize as your brothers, have said so yourself," continued Villefort in a slightly altered voice, "and that you alone are perfect?
048.054 --Not perfect, replied the count; impenetrable, that is all. But let's break this up, sir, if the conversation displeases you; I am no more threatened by your justice than you are by my double vision.
048.055 --No, no, sir! said Villefort, who was doubtless afraid of appearing to abandon the field; no! By your brilliant and almost sublime conversation, you have raised me above the ordinary level; we are no longer talking, we are disserting. Now, you know how much theologians in the pulpit of the Sorbonne, or philosophers in their disputes, sometimes say cruel truths to each other: let us suppose that we are doing social theology and theological philosophy, I will therefore say this one to you, rough as it is: My brother, you are sacrificing to pride; you are above others, but above you there is God.
048.056 --Above all, sir!" replied Monte Cristo with an accent so deep that Villefort shivered involuntarily. I have my pride for men, snakes always ready to rise up against the one who exceeds them with his forehead without crushing them with his foot. But I lay down this pride before God, who drew me out of nothingness to make me what I am.
048.057 - "Then, Monsieur le Comte, I admire you," said Villefort, who for the first time in this strange dialogue had just used this aristocratic formula in relation to the stranger whom he had hitherto called only monsieur. Yes, I tell you, if you are really strong, really superior, really holy or impenetrable, which, you are right, amounts to much the same thing, be superb, sir; it is the law of dominions. But you do have some ambition?
048.058 -- I do, sir.
048.059 -What is it?
048.060 - I, too, as has happened to every man once in his life, was taken by Satan to the highest mountain on earth; when I got there, he showed me the whole world, and, as he had once said to Christ, he said to me: "Let's see, child of men, what do you want to worship me?" Then I thought for a long time, for for a long time a terrible ambition had indeed been devouring my heart; then I answered him, "Listen, I have always heard of Providence, and yet I have never seen it, nor anything like it, which makes me believe that it does not exist; I want to be Providence, for what I know to be the most beautiful, the greatest and the most sublime thing in the world, is to reward and to punish." But Satan bowed his head and sighed. "You are mistaken," he said, "Providence exists; only you do not see it, because, being the daughter of God, it is invisible like its father. You have seen nothing like it, because it proceeds by hidden springs and walks by obscure ways; all I can do for you is to make you one of the agents of this Providence." The bargain was made; I may lose my soul in it, but no matter," resumed Monte Cristo, "and the bargain would be to be made again that I would do it again."
048.061 Villefort looked at Monte Cristo with sublime astonishment.
048.062 "Monsieur le Comte," he said, "do you have any relatives?
048.063 --No, sir, I am alone in the world.
048.064 --That's too bad!
048.065 --Why?" asked Monte Cristo.
048.066 --Because you could have seen a spectacle that would have shattered your pride. You fear only death, you say?
048.067 -- I do not say that I fear it, I say that it alone can stop me.
048.068 --And old age?
048.069 --My mission will be accomplished before I am old.
048.070 --And madness?
048.071 --I failed to go mad, and you know the axiom: _non bis in idem_; it is a criminal axiom, and therefore, it is your responsibility.
048.072 -Monsieur, Villefort continued, there is still something else to fear than death, old age, or madness: there is, for example, apoplexy, that thunderbolt which strikes you without destroying you, and after which, however, everything is over. It is still you, and yet you are no longer you; you who touched, like Ariel, the angel, you are now only an inert mass which, like Caliban, touches the beast; this is called quite simply, as I told you, in human language, an apoplexy. Come, if you please, to continue this conversation at my house, Monsieur le Comte, one day when you feel like meeting an adversary capable of understanding you and eager to refute you, and I will show you my father, M. Noirtier de Villefort, one of the most fiery Jacobins of the French Revolution, that is to say, the most brilliant audacity put at the service of the most vigorous organization; a man who, like you, had perhaps not seen all the kingdoms of the earth, but had helped to overthrow one of the most powerful; a man who, like you, claimed to be one of the envoys, not of God, but of the Supreme Being, not of Providence, but of Fate; well, sir, the rupture of a blood vessel in a lobe of the brain has shattered all this, not in a day, not in an hour, but in a second. The day before, M. Noirtier, former Jacobin, former senator, former carbonaro, laughing at the guillotine, laughing at the cannon, laughing at the dagger, M. Noirtier, playing with the revolutions. M. Noirtier, for whom France was only a vast chessboard from which pawns, rooks, knights and queen had to disappear as long as the king was checkmate, M. Noirtier, so formidable, was the next day _that poor old man Noirtier_, immobile, delivered to the wills of the weakest being in the house, that is to say, his granddaughter Valentine; a mute and frozen corpse, finally, who lives without suffering only to give time to matter to arrive without jolting at its complete decomposition.
048.073 -- Alas! sir, said Monte-Cristo, this spectacle is not strange either to my eyes or to my mind; I am somewhat of a doctor, and I have, like my colleagues, sought more than once for the soul in living matter or in dead matter; and, like Providence, it has remained invisible to my eyes, though present to my heart. A hundred authors, since Socrates, since Seneca, since St. Augustine, since Gall, have made in prose or in verse the connection you have just made; but nevertheless I understand that the sufferings of a father can operate great changes in the mind of his son. I will go, sir, since you are willing to oblige me to do so, to contemplate for the benefit of my humility this terrible spectacle which must greatly sadden your house.
048.074 --That would be without doubt, if God had not given me a large compensation. Opposite the old man who is dragging himself to the grave are two children who are entering life: Valentine, a daughter of my first marriage to Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, and Edward, the son whose life you saved.
048.075 --And what do you conclude from this compensation, sir?
048.076 -- I conclude, sir," replied Villefort, "that my father, led astray by passions, has committed some of those faults which escape human justice, but which come under the justice of God, and that God, wishing to punish only one person, has struck only him."
048.077 Monte Cristo, with a smile on his lips, uttered a roar in his heart that would have made Villefort flee, if Villefort could have heard him.
048.078 "Farewell, sir," said the magistrate, who had been standing up and speaking for some time, "I leave you, taking with me a memory of esteem which I hope will be pleasant to you when you get to know me better, for I am not a commonplace man. You have made an eternal friend in Mme de Villefort.
048.079 The Count saluted and was content to lead back to the door of his study only Villefort, who returned to his carriage preceded by two lackeys who, at a sign from their master, hastened to open it for him.
048.080 Then, when the king's prosecutor had disappeared
048.081 "Come on," said Monte Cristo, drawing with effort a smile from his oppressed chest; "come on, enough poison like this, and now that my heart is full of it, let's go and get the antidote."
048.082 And striking a blow on the resounding bell:
048.083 "I'm going up to Madame's," he said to Ali; "let the carriage be ready in half an hour!"
049.000 Haydée.
049.001 One remembers which were the new or rather the old acquaintances of the Count of Monte-Cristo who lived in Meslay street: they were Maximilien, Julie and Emmanuel.
049. 002 The hope of this good visit which he was going to make, of these few happy moments which he was going to spend, of this glimmer of paradise slipping into the hell in which he had voluntarily committed himself, had spread, from the moment when he had lost sight of Villefort the most charming serenity on the face of the count, and Ali, who had run to the sound of the bell, on seeing this face so radiant with a joy so rare, had withdrawn on tiptoe and with suspended breath, as if not to frighten the good thoughts which he believed to see fluttering around his master.
049.003 It was noon: the Count had set aside an hour to go up to Haydée's house; it seemed as if joy could not suddenly return to this soul that had been broken for so long, and that it needed to prepare itself for gentle emotions, as other souls need to prepare themselves for violent emotions.
049.004 The young Greek woman was, as we have said, in an apartment entirely separate from the apartment of the count. This apartment was entirely furnished in the Oriental manner; that is to say, the floors were covered with thick Turkish rugs, brocade cloths fell down the walls, and in each room a wide couch reigned all around the room with piles of cushions which moved at the will of those who used them.
049.005 Haydée had three French women and one Greek woman. The three French women stood in the first room, ready to run to the sound of a small golden bell and obey the orders of the Roman slave, who knew enough French to transmit the wishes of her mistress to her three chambermaids, to whom Monte Cristo had recommended to have for Haydée the respect that one would have for a queen.
049.006 The young girl was in the most remote room of her apartment, that is to say in a kind of round boudoir, lit only from above, and in which the day penetrated only through pink glass panes. She was lying on the floor on blue satin cushions embroidered with silver, half inverted on the couch, framing her head with her softly rounded right arm, while, with her left, she stared through her lips at the coral tube in which was set the flexible pipe of a hookah, which only let the steam reach her mouth perfumed by benzoin water, through which her sweet aspiration forced it to pass.
049.007 Its pose, quite natural for a woman of the East, would have been for a Frenchwoman of a coquetry perhaps a little affected.
049. 008 As for her toilet, it was that of the epirotes women, i.e. a white satin underpants embroidered with pink flowers, and which left with discovered two feet of child which one would have believed marble of Paros, if one had not seen them playing with two small sandals with the curved point, embroidered of gold and pearls; a jacket with long blue and white stripes, with broad sleeves slit for the arms, with silver buttonholes and buttons of pearls; finally a kind of corset letting, by its cut opened in heart, to see the neck and all the top of the chest, and buttoning up below the breast by three buttons of diamond. As for the bottom of the corset and the top of the underpants, they were lost in one of the belts with the bright colors and the long silky bangs which make the ambition of our elegant Parisian women.
049.009 The head was topped with a small gold cap embroidered with pearls, tilted to the side, and below the cap, on the side where it was tilted, a beautiful natural rose of purple color stood out mixed with hair so black that it seemed blue.
049.010 As for the beauty of this face, it was the Greek beauty in all the perfection of its type, with its large velvety black eyes, its straight nose, its lips of coral and its teeth of pearls.
049.011 Then, on this charming whole, the flower of youth was spread with all its brightness and all its perfume; Haydée could have been nineteen or twenty years old.
049.012 Monte-Cristo called the Greek companion, and asked Haydée for permission to enter with her.
049.013 For all answer, Haydée made a sign to the following to raise the tapestry which hung in front of the door, whose square frame framed the young girl lying down like a charming painting. Monte-Cristo advanced.
049.014 Haydée raised herself on the elbow that held the hookah, and holding out her hand to the Count at the same time she welcomed him with a smile:
049.015 "Why," she said in the sonorous language of the daughters of Sparta and Athens, "why do you make me ask permission to enter my house? Are you no longer my master, am I no longer your slave?"
049.016 Monte-Cristo smiled in his turn.
049.017 "Haydée," he said, "you know....
049.018 --Why don't you say you to me as usual?" interrupted the young Greek girl; "have I done something wrong? In that case I must be punished, but not told you.
049.019 --Haydee," continued the Count, "you know that we are in France, and therefore that you are free.
049.020 --Free to do what? asked the young girl.
049.021 --Free to leave me.
049.022 --Leave you!... and why should I leave you?
049.023 -- What do I know? We are going to see the world.
049.024 -- I don't want to see anyone.
049.025 -- And if among the handsome young men you meet, you find one you like, I would not be so unfair....
049.026 --I have never seen a more beautiful man than you, and I have never loved anyone but my father and you.
049.027 -- Poor child, said Monte-Cristo, it is that you have hardly spoken to anyone but your father and me.
049.028 --Well, what do I need to talk to others? My father called me "his joy"; you call me "your love", and both of you call me "your child".
049.029 --Do you remember your father, Haydee?"
049.030 The girl smiled.
049.031 "He is here and there," she said, putting her hand over her eyes and her heart.
049.032 --And me, where am I?" asked Monte Cristo, smiling.
049.033 --You, she said, you are everywhere."
049.034 Monte Cristo took Haydée's hand to kiss it; but the naive child withdrew her hand and presented her forehead.
049.035 "Now, Haydée," he said to her, "you know that you are free, that you are mistress, that you are queen; you can keep your costume or leave it at your whim; you will stay here when you want to stay, you will go out when you want to go out; there will always be a carriage harnessed for you; Ali and Myrto will accompany you everywhere and will be at your orders; only one thing, I beg you.
049.036 --Say.
049.037 -- Keep your birth a secret, do not say a word about your past; do not on any occasion pronounce the name of your illustrious father or that of your poor mother.
049.038 --I have already told you, my lord, I will see no one.
049.039 --Listen, Haydée; perhaps this all-Eastern seclusion will be impossible in Paris: continue to learn the life of our northern countries as you did in Rome, Florence, Milan, and Madrid; it will serve you always, whether you continue to live here or return to the East."
049.040 The girl looked up at the Count with her large wet eyes and replied:
049.041 "Or that we return to the East, do you mean, do you not, my lord?
049.042 -- Yes, my daughter," said Monte Cristo, "you know that it is never I who will leave you. It is not the tree that leaves the flower, it is the flower that leaves the tree.
049.043 --I will never leave you, my lord," said Haydée, "because I am sure that I could not live without you.
049.044 - Poor child! In ten years I will be old, and in ten years you will still be young.
049.045 --My father had a long white beard, that did not prevent me from loving him; my father was sixty years old, and he seemed to me more beautiful than all the young men I saw.
049.046 --But come on, tell me, do you think you'll get used to it here?
049.047 --Will I see you?
049.048 --Every day.
049.049 -- Well, what are you asking me, my lord?
049.050 -- I fear you are bored.
049.051 -- No, my lord, because in the morning I will think that you will come, and in the evening I will remember that you have come; besides, when I am alone, I have great memories, I see again immense pictures, great horizons with Pindus and Olympus in the distance; then I have in my heart three feelings with which one is never bored: sadness, love and gratitude.
049.052 --You are a worthy girl of Epirus, Haydée, graceful and poetic, and one sees that you descend from this family of goddesses which was born in your country. Be quiet then, my daughter, I will make sure that your youth is not lost, because if you love me like your father, I love you like my child.
049.053 -You are mistaken, my lord; I did not love my father as I love you; my love for you is another love: my father is dead and I am not dead; whereas you, if you died, I would die."
049.054 The Count held out his hand to the girl with a smile of deep tenderness; she pressed her lips to it as usual.
049.055 And the Count, thus disposed to the interview he was going to have with Morrel and his family, left murmuring these verses of Pindar:
049.056 "Youth is a flower of which love is the fruit.... Happy the harvester who picks it after seeing it slowly ripen."
049.057 According to his orders, the car was ready. He climbed in, and the car, as always, galloped off.
050.000 The Morrel family.
050.001 The Count arrived in a few minutes on Rue Meslay, No. 7.
050.002 The house was white, cheerful and preceded by a courtyard in which two small beds contained rather beautiful flowers.
050.003 In the janitor who opened this door to him the count recognized old Coclès. But as this one it is remembered, had only one eye, and that for nine years this eye had still considerably weakened, Coclès did not recognize the count.
050.004 The cars, to stop in front of the entry, had to turn, in order to avoid a small jet of water spouting from a rock basin, magnificence which had excited many jealousies in the district, and which was cause that one called this house the _Petit-Versailles_.
050.005 Needless to say that in the basin maneuvered a crowd of red and yellow fish.
050.006 The house, raised above a floor of kitchens and cellars, had, in addition to the first floor, two full floors and attic space; the young people had bought it with the outbuildings, which consisted of a huge workshop, two pavilions at the bottom of a garden and the garden itself. Emmanuel had, at first sight, seen in this arrangement a small speculation to be made; he had reserved for himself the house, half of the garden, and had drawn a line, that is to say that he had built a wall between himself and the workshops which he had rented with the pavilions and the portion of the garden which was related to it; so that he found himself accommodated for a rather modest sum, and as well closed at home as the most meticulous owner of a hotel in the Faubourg Saint-Germain
050.007 The dining room was of oak, the living room of mahogany and blue velvet; the bedroom of lemon and green damask; there was also a study for Emmanuel, who did not work, and a music room for Julie, who was not a musician.
050.008 The entire second floor was devoted to Maximilian: there was an exact replica of his sister's apartment, only the dining room had been converted into a billiard room where he brought his friends.
050.009 He was himself supervising the grooming of his horse, and was smoking his cigar at the entrance to the garden when the Count's carriage stopped at the door.
050.010 Coclès opened the door, as we have said, and Baptistin, springing from his seat, asked if Mr. and Mrs. Herbault and Mr. Maximilien Morrel were visible to the Count of Monte Cristo.
050.011 "For the Count of Monte Cristo!" cried Morrel, throwing away his cigar and rushing to meet his visitor: "I believe that we are visible to him! Ah, thank you, a hundred thanks, Monsieur le Comte, for not having forgotten your promise."
050.012 And the young officer shook hands so cordially with the count, that the latter could not mistake the frankness of the demonstration, and he saw well that he had been eagerly expected and eagerly received.
050.013 "Come, come," said Maximilien, "I want to serve as your introducer; a man like you must not be announced by a servant; my sister is in her garden, breaking wilted roses; my brother is reading his two newspapers, _La Presse_ and _les Débats_, six paces from her, for wherever one sees Mme. Herbault, one has only to look within a radius of four yards, M. Emmanuel is there, and vice versa, as they say at the École polytechnique."
050.014 The sound of footsteps caused a young woman of twenty to twenty-five years of age, dressed in a silk robe, and peeling a hazelnut rosebush with particular care, to raise her head.
050.015 This woman was our little Julie, who had become, as the agent of Thomson and French had predicted, Mrs. Emmanuel Herbault.
050.016 She shrieked when she saw a stranger. Maximilian laughed.
050.017 "Don't bother, sister," he said, "Monsieur le Comte has only been in Paris for two or three days, but he already knows what a Marais rentier is, and if he doesn't, you'll teach him.
050.018 - "Oh, sir," said Julie, "to bring you here like this is a betrayal of my brother, who has not the least coquetry for his poor sister. .... I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do that. Penelon!..."
050.019 An old man who was digging a bed of Bengal roses stuck his spade in the ground and approached, cap in hand, concealing as best he could a chew that had sunk momentarily into the depths of his cheeks. A few white streaks silvered his still thick hair, while his tanned complexion and his bold, lively eye announced the old sailor, browned by the sun of the equator and tanned by the breath of storms.
050.020 "I think you have hailed me, Miss Julie," he said, "here I am."
050.021 Penelon had retained the habit of calling his boss's daughter Miss Julie, and had never been able to take the habit of calling her Mrs. Herbault.
050.022 "Penelon," said Julie, "go and tell Mr. Emmanuel of the good visit that is coming to us, while Mr. Maximilian will lead monsieur to the salon."
050.023 Then turning to Monte Cristo:
050.024 "Monsieur will allow me to run away for a minute, won't you?"
050.025 And without waiting for the Count's assent, she dashed behind a clump and gained the house by a side alley.
050.026 "Ah, my dear Monsieur Morrel," said Monte Cristo, "I realize with pain that I am making a revolution in your family.
050.027 - "Here, here," said Maximilian, laughing, "do you see the husband over there, who is going to exchange his jacket for a frock coat? Oh! they know you at rue Meslay, you were announced, I beg you to believe it.
050.028 --You seem to me to have a happy family there, sir," said the Count, answering his own thought.
050.029 --Oh, yes, I can vouch for that, sir, what do you want? They lack nothing to be happy: they are young, they are cheerful, they love each other, and with their twenty-five thousand pounds of income they imagine that they, who have, however, rubbed shoulders with so many immense fortunes, have the wealth of the Rothschilds.
050.030 - "It is not much, however, twenty-five thousand pounds of income," said Monte Cristo with a sweetness so sweet that it penetrated Maximilian's heart as the voice of a tender father might have done; "but they will not stop there, our young people, they will become in their turn millionaires. Your brother-in-law is a lawyer, a doctor?
050.031 -- He was a merchant, Count, and had taken over my poor father's house. He was a merchant, and had taken over the house of my poor father. Mr. Morrel died leaving five hundred thousand francs of fortune; I had half of it and my sister the other half, for we were only two children. Her husband, who had married her with no other heritage than her noble probity, her first-rate intelligence and her unblemished reputation, wanted to possess as much as his wife. He worked until he had amassed two hundred and fifty thousand francs; six years were enough. It was, I swear to you, Mr. Count, a touching spectacle that of these two children, so industrious, so united, destined by their ability to the highest fortune, and who, having wanted to change nothing in the habits of their father's house, took six years to do what the innovators could have done in two or three, so Marseilles still resounds with the praise that could not be refused to so much courageous self-denial. Finally, one day, Emmanuel came to find his wife, who was finishing paying the bill.
050.032 "--Julie," he said to her, "here is the last roll of one hundred francs which Coclès has just given me and which completes the two hundred and fifty thousand francs which we have fixed as the limit of our earnings. Will you be satisfied with this little which we will have to be satisfied from now on? Listen, the house does a million francs worth of business a year, and can bring in forty thousand francs in profits. We will sell, if we want, the clientele, three hundred thousand francs in an hour, because here is a letter from M. Delaunay, who is offering them to us in exchange for our funds, which he wants to combine with his. See what you think needs to be done.
050.033 "-My friend, says my sister, the Morrel house can only be held by a Morrel. To save our father's name forever from the bad luck of fortune, isn't that worth three hundred thousand francs?
050.034 "--I thought so," replied Emmanuel; "however, I wanted to take your advice.
050.035 "--Well, my friend, here it is. All our receipts are made, all our bills are paid; we can draw a bar below this fortnight's account and close our counters; let us draw that bar and close it." This was done at once. It was three o'clock: at a quarter past three, a customer came in to have the passage of two ships insured; it was a profit of fifteen thousand francs cash.
050.036 "--Sir," said Emmanuel, "please contact our colleague M. Delaunay for this insurance. As for us, we have left the business.
050.037 "--And since when?" asked the astonished client.
050.038 "--For a quarter of an hour.
050.039 "And this, sir," continued Maximilian, smiling, "is how my sister and brother-in-law have only twenty-five thousand pounds of income."
050.040 Maximilian had scarcely finished his narration, during which the count's heart had dilated more and more, when Emmanuel reappeared, restored in a hat and frock coat.
050.041 He saluted as a man who knew the quality of the visitor; then, after taking the Count around the little flowery enclosure, he led him back to the house.
050.042 The living room was already embalmed with flowers contained with great difficulty in an immense vase of Japan with natural handles. Julie, appropriately dressed and coquettishly coiffed (she had accomplished this tour de force in ten minutes), presented herself to receive the Count at his entrance.
050.043 One heard the cackling of the birds of a nearby aviary; the branches of the false ebony trees and the pink acacias came to border with their bunches the curtains of blue velvet: all in this charming small retreat breathed the calm, since the song of the bird to the smile of the Masters.
050.044 The count since his entry in the house had already impregnated himself of this happiness; also remained mute, dreamy, forgetting that one awaited him to take again the conversation interrupted after the first compliments.
050.045 He noticed that this silence had become almost unseemly, and tore himself away from his reverie with effort:
050.046 "Madam," he said at last, "forgive me for an emotion which must surprise you, accustomed to this peace and happiness which I meet here, but for me it is so new a thing as the satisfaction on a human face, that I do not tire of looking at you and your husband.
050.047 --We are very happy, indeed, sir," replied Julie; "but we have been a long time suffering, and few people have bought their happiness as dearly as we have."
050.048 Curiosity painted itself on the count's features.
050.049 "Oh, it is a whole family history, as Chateau-Renaud told you the other day," Maximilien resumed; "for you, Monsieur le Comte, accustomed to seeing illustrious misfortunes and splendid joys, there would be little interest in this interior picture. However we have, as Julie has just said to you, suffered very sharp pains, although they were enclosed in this small frame....
050.050 --And God poured out to you, as he does for all, consolation on suffering? asked Monte-Cristo.
050.051 --Yes, Monsieur le Comte, said Julie; we can say so, for he has done for us what he does only for his chosen ones; he has sent us one of his angels."
050.052 The red rose to the count's cheeks, and he coughed for a way to conceal his emotion by bringing his handkerchief to his mouth.
050.053 "Those who were born in a cradle of purple and have never desired anything," said Emmanuel, "do not know what it is to be happy in life; just as those do not know the price of a pure sky, who have never surrendered their lives to the mercy of four planks thrown on a raging sea."
050.054 Monte Cristo rose, and, without answering anything, for by the tremor of his voice one could have recognized the emotion with which he was agitated, he began to walk step by step through the salon.
050.055 "Our magnificence makes you smile, Monsieur le Comte," said Maximilien, who followed Monte Cristo with his eyes.
050.056 --No, no, replied Monte Cristo, very pale and compressing with one hand the beating of his heart, while with the other he showed the young man a crystal globe under which a silk purse lay preciously on a black velvet cushion. I only wondered what this purse was for, which on one side contained a paper, it seemed to me, and on the other a rather fine diamond."
050.057 Maximilian assumed a grave air and replied:
050.058 "This, sir count, is the most precious of our family treasures.
050.059 -- Indeed, this diamond is quite beautiful," replied Monte Cristo.
050.060 --Oh! my brother does not speak to you about the price of the stone, although it is estimated at one hundred thousand francs, sir count; he only wants to tell you that the objects contained in this purse are the relics of the angel of which we spoke to you a moment ago.
050.061 --This is what I cannot understand, and yet what I must not ask, madam, replied Monte Cristo, bowing; forgive me, I did not want to be indiscreet.
050.062 --Indiscreet, you say? oh, how happy you make us, sir count, on the contrary, by offering us an opportunity to dwell on this subject! If we were to conceal as a secret the beautiful deed that this purse recalls, we would not expose it to public view. Oh! we would like to be able to publish it in all the universe, so that a flinch of our unknown benefactor would reveal its presence to us.
050.063 --Ah, really!" said Monte Cristo in a muffled voice.
050.064 --Monsieur, said Maximilien, lifting the crystal globe and religiously kissing the silk purse, this touched the hand of a man by whom my father was saved from death, we from ruin, and our name from shame; of a man thanks to whom we, poor children doomed to misery and tears, can today hear people rave about our happiness. This letter--and Maximilian drew a bill from the purse and presented it to the Count--this letter was written by him one day when my father had taken a very desperate resolution, and this diamond was given as a dowry to my sister by this generous stranger."
050.065 Monte Cristo opened the letter and read it with an indefinable expression of happiness; it was the bill which our readers know, addressed to Julie and signed Simbad the sailor.
050.066 -- Unknown, you say? So the man who did you this service is still unknown to you?
050.067 -- Yes, sir, we have never had the happiness of shaking his hand; it is not for want of having asked God for this favor, Maximilian continued; but there has been in this whole adventure a mysterious direction that we cannot yet understand; everything has been led by an invisible hand, as powerful as that of an enchanter.
050.068 --Oh! said Julie, I have not yet lost all hope of ever kissing that hand as I kiss the purse it touched. Four years ago, Penelon was in Trieste: Penelon, sir count, is that brave sailor whom you saw with a spade in his hand, and who, from foreman, became a gardener. Penelon, being thus in Trieste, saw on the quay an Englishman who was going to embark on a yacht, and he recognized the one who came to my father's house on June 5, 1829, and who wrote me this bill on September 5. It was indeed the same one, as he assures me, but he did not dare to speak to him.
050.069 -- An Englishman!" said Monte Cristo dreamily, worried by every glance of Julie's face; "an Englishman, you say?
050.070 -- Yes," said Maximilian, "an Englishman who came to us as an agent of Thomson and French, of Rome. I have not been able to find the time to go to the hospital, and I have not been able to find the time to go to the hospital, and I have not been able to find the time to go to the hospital, and I have not been able to find the time to go to the hospital. In the name of Heaven, sir, this was, as we told you, in 1829; did you know this Englishman?
050.071 --But didn't you also tell me that Thomson and French had constantly denied having done you this service?
050.072 --Yes.
050.073 --So this Englishman is not a man who is grateful to your father for some good deed he himself has forgotten, and has taken this pretext to do him a favor?
050.074 --Anything is possible, sir, in such circumstances, even a miracle.
050.075 --What was his name?
050.076 --He left no other name," replied Julie, looking at the Count with deep attention, "than the name he signed at the bottom of the bill: Simbad the sailor.
050.077 --This is not a name, of course, but a pseudonym."
050.078 Then, as Julie looked at him even more intently and tried to catch on the fly and gather some notes from his voice:
050.079 "Let's see," he continued, "isn't this a man about my height, a little taller perhaps, a little thinner, imprisoned in a high tie, buttoned, corseted, strapped, and always with a pencil in his hand?
050.080 --Oh, but do you know him?" cried Julie, her eyes sparkling with joy.
050.081 -- No, said Monte Cristo, I only suppose. I have known a Lord Wilmore who sowed traits of generosity in this way.
050.082 --Without making himself known!
050.083 --He was a strange man who did not believe in gratitude.
050.084 --Oh!" exclaimed Julie with a sublime accent and joining her hands, "what does he believe in, the wretch!
050.085 -- He did not believe in it, at least at the time when I knew him, said Monte Cristo, whom this voice from the depths of his soul had stirred to the last fiber; but since that time perhaps he has had some proof that gratitude existed.
050.086 --And you know this man, sir? asked Emmanuel.
050.087 --Oh, if you know him, sir," cried Julie, "can you take us to him, show us him, tell us where he is? Say, Maximilian, say, Emmanuel, if we ever find him, he must believe in the memory of the heart."
050.088 Monte Cristo felt two tears roll down his eyes; he took a few more steps into the salon.
050.089 "In the name of Heaven!" said Maximilian, "if you know anything about this man, tell us what you know!
050.090 -- Alas!" said Monte Cristo, compressing the emotion in his voice, "if it is Lord Wilmore your benefactor, I fear you will never find him. I left him two or three years ago in Palermo and he was leaving for the most fabulous countries; so much so that I doubt very much that he will ever return.
050.091 --Ah, sir, you are cruel!" cried Julie with fright.
050.092 And tears came to the young woman's eyes.
050.093 "Madame," said Monte Cristo gravely, devouring with his eyes the two liquid pearls that rolled down Julie's cheeks, "if Lord Wilmore had seen what I have just seen here, he would still love life, for the tears you shed would mend him with the human race."
050.094 And he held out his hand to Julie, who gave him hers, drawn as she was by the look and accent of the earl.
050.095 "But this Lord Wilmore," she said, clinging to a last hope, "he had a country, a family, relatives, he was known at last? Couldn't we...?
050.096 --Oh, don't look for it, madam," said the Count, "don't build sweet chimeras on this word that I have let slip. No, Lord Wilmore is probably not the man you are looking for: he was my friend, I knew all his secrets, he would have told me this one.
050.097 --And he told you nothing of it?" cried Julie.
050.098 --Nothing.
050.099 --Never a word that could make you suppose...
050.100 --Never.
050.101 --You named him right away, though.
050.102 --Ah! you know... in such cases, one assumes.
050.103 --My sister, my sister," said Maximilian coming to the aid of the Count, "the gentleman is right. Remember what our good father has so often said to us: "It is not an Englishman who has given us this happiness."
050.104 Monte Cristo shuddered.
050.105 "Your father was telling you... Monsieur Morrel?..." he continued briskly.
050.106 -My father, sir, saw in this action a miracle. My father believed in a benefactor who came to us from the grave. Oh, what a touching superstition that was, and how far I was from wanting to destroy that belief in his noble heart, even though I did not believe in it myself! Also how often he dreamed of it, pronouncing softly the name of a dear friend, the name of a lost friend; and when he was near death, when the approach of eternity had given his mind something of the illumination of the grave, this thought, which had hitherto been only a doubt, became a conviction, and the last words he pronounced as he was dying were these: "Maximilien, it was Edmond Dantes!"
050.107 The Count's pallor, which for some seconds had been increasing, became frightening at these words. All his blood had just rushed to his heart, he could not speak, he drew his watch as if he had forgotten the time, took his hat, presented Madame Herbault with a curt and embarrassed compliment, and shook hands with Emmanuel and Maximilien:
050.108 "Madame," he said, "allow me to come sometimes to pay you my duties. I love your house, and I am grateful for your welcome, for this is the first time I have forgotten myself in many years."
050.109 And he stomped out.
050.110 "He is a singular man, this Count of Monte Cristo," said Emmanuel.
050.111 --Yes, replied Maximilian, but I believe he has an excellent heart, and I am sure he loves us.
050.112 --And I!" said Julie, "his voice has been in my heart, and two or three times it seemed to me that it was not the first time I had heard it."
051.000 Pyrame et Thisbé.
051.001 At two thirds of the faubourg Saint-Honoré, behind a beautiful hotel, remarkable among the remarkable dwellings of this rich district, extends a vast garden whose bushy chestnut trees exceed the enormous walls, high as ramparts, and let, when spring comes, fall their pink and white flowers in two fluted stone vases placed parallel on two quadrangular pilasters in which an iron gate of the time of Louis XIII is set.
051.002 This grandiose entrance is condemned, in spite of the magnificent geraniums which grow in the two vases and which sway their marbled leaves and their purple flowers in the wind, since the owners of the hotel, and this dates from a long time already, have restricted themselves to the possession of the hotel, of the courtyard planted with trees which gives onto the suburb, and of the garden which this gate closes off, which formerly gave onto a splendid one-acre vegetable garden annexed to the property. But the demon of speculation having drawn a line, that is to say a street at the end of this kitchen garden, and the street, before existing, having already thanks to a plate of burnished iron, received a name, one thought to be able to sell this kitchen garden to build on the street, and to make competition with this great artery of Paris which one calls the faubourg Saint-Honore.
051. 003 But, as regards speculation, man proposes and money disposes; the baptized street died in the cradle; the purchaser of the vegetable garden, after having paid it perfectly, could not find to resell it the sum which he wanted, and, while waiting for an increase in price, which cannot fail, one day or another, to compensate him well beyond his past losses and his capital at rest, he was satisfied to rent this enclosure to market gardeners, for the sum of five hundred francs per annum.
051.004 This is money invested at half a percent, which is not expensive in these times, when there are so many people who invest it at fifty, and who still find the money a very poor return.
051.005 Nevertheless, as we have said, the garden gate, which once opened onto the vegetable garden, is condemned, and rust is eating away at its hinges; there is even more: so that vile market gardeners do not sully the interior of the aristocratic enclosure with their vulgar glances, a partition of boards is applied to the bars up to the height of six feet. It is true that the boards are not so well joined that one cannot slip a furtive glance between the intervals; but this house is a severe house, and one that does not fear indiscretions.
051.006 In this vegetable garden, instead of cabbages, carrots, radishes, peas and melons, grow large alfalfa plants, the only crop that announces that one still thinks of this abandoned place. A small low door, opening on the projected street, gives entrance to this walled land, which its tenants have just abandoned because of its sterility and which, for the past eight days, instead of bringing in half a percent, as in the past, no longer brings in anything at all.
051.007 On the side of the hotel, the chestnut trees of which we have spoken crown the wall, which does not prevent other luxuriant and flowery trees from slipping in their intervals their branches eager for air. At a corner where the foliage becomes so thick that hardly any light penetrates, a large stone bench and garden seats indicate a meeting place or a favorite retreat for some inhabitant of the hotel located a hundred paces away, and which one can hardly see through the green rampart that envelops it. Finally, the choice of this mysterious asylum is at once justified by the absence of the sun, by the eternal coolness even during the hottest days of summer, by the chirping of the birds, and by the distance from the house and the street, that is, from business and noise.
051.008 Towards the evening of one of the hottest days that spring had yet granted to the inhabitants of Paris, there was on this stone bench a book, an umbrella, a work basket and a batiste handkerchief whose embroidery had been started; and not far from this bench, near the gate, standing in front of the boards, her eye applied to the clerestory partition, a young woman, whose gaze plunged through a crack into the deserted garden that we know of
051. 009 Almost at the same moment, the small door of this ground closed without noise, and a young man, tall, vigorous, dressed in a blouse of unbleached cloth, a velvet cap, but whose moustaches, beard and extremely neat black hair swore somewhat with this popular costume, after a quick glance thrown around him to make sure that nobody spied on him, passing by this door, which he closed again behind him, moved with a hasty step towards the gate.
051.010 At the sight of the one she was waiting for, but probably not in that costume, the girl was frightened and threw herself back.
051.011 And yet already, through the slits in the door, the young man, with that look that belongs only to lovers, had seen the white robe and the long blue belt floating. He dashed towards the partition, and applying his mouth to an opening:
051.012 "Do not be afraid, Valentine," he said, "it is I."
051.013 The girl approached.
051.014 "Oh, sir," she said, "why did you come so late today? Do you know that we are going to have dinner soon, and that it took me a lot of diplomacy and a lot of promptness to get rid of my mother-in-law, who is spying on me, my maid who is spying on me, and my brother who is tormenting me, to come here to work on this embroidery, which I am afraid will not be finished for a long time? Then, when you will have apologized for your delay, you will tell me which is this new costume which it pleased you to adopt and which almost was cause that I did not recognize you.
051.015 --Dear Valentine, said the young man, you are too much above my love for me to dare to speak to you about it, and yet, every time that I see you, I need to tell you that I adore you, so that the echo of my own words gently caresses my heart when I no longer see you. Now I thank you for your scolding: it is quite charming, because it proves to me, I dare not say that you were waiting for me, but that you were thinking of me. You wanted to know the cause of my delay and the reason for my disguise; I will tell you, and I hope you will excuse them: I have chosen a state....
051.016 --A state!... What do you mean, Maximilian? And are we so happy that you speak of what concerns us in jest?
051.017 --Oh! God forbid," said the young man, "that I should joke about what is my life; but tired of being a runner of fields and a climber of walls, seriously frightened of the idea you gave me the other night that your father would have me tried one day as a thief, which would compromise the honor of the entire French army, not less frightened of the possibility that one would be surprised to see eternally revolving around this ground, where there is not the smallest citadel to besiege or the smallest blockhouse to defend, a captain of spahis, I became a market gardener, and I adopted the costume of my profession.
051.018 --Well, what madness!
051.019 -- On the contrary, it is the wisest thing, I believe, that I have done in my life, because it gives us all security.
051.020 -- Let's see, explain yourself.
051.021 -- Well, I went to find the owner of this paddock; the lease with the old tenants was up, and I leased it back to him. All this alfalfa that you see belongs to me, Valentine; there is nothing to prevent me from building myself a hut in the hay and living from now on at twenty steps from you. Oh! my joy and happiness, I cannot contain them. Do you understand, Valentine, that one can pay for these things? It's impossible, isn't it? Well, all this bliss, all this happiness, all this joy, for which I would have given ten years of my life, cost me, guess how much? Five hundred francs a year, payable quarterly. Thus, you see, from now on nothing to fear. I am at home here, I can put ladders against my wall and look over them, and I have, without fear of a patrol coming to disturb me, the right to tell you that I love you, as long as your pride will not be hurt to hear this word come out of the mouth of a poor day laborer dressed in a smock and wearing a cap."
051.022 Valentine gave a little cry of joyful surprise; then suddenly:
051.023 "Alas, Maximilian," she said sadly, and as if a jealous cloud had suddenly come to veil the ray of sunshine which illuminated her heart, "now we shall be too free, our happiness will make us tempt God; we shall abuse our security, and our security will lose us.
051.024 --Can you say that to me, my friend, who, since I have known you, has proved to you every day that I have subordinated my thoughts and my life to your life and your thoughts? Who gave you confidence in me? My happiness, isn't it? When you told me that a vague instinct assured you that you were in some great danger, I put my devotion at your service, without asking for any other reward than the happiness of serving you. Since that time, have I, by a word, by a sign, given you the opportunity to repent of having distinguished myself among those who would have been happy to die for you? You told me, poor child, that you were engaged to M. d'Épinay, that your father had decided on this alliance, that is to say that it was certain, for whatever M. de Villefort wants happens infallibly. Well, I have remained in the shadows, expecting everything, not from my will, not from yours, but from events, from Providence, from God, and yet you love me, you have had pity on me, Valentine, and you have told me so; thank you for this sweet word which I only ask you to repeat to me from time to time, and which will make me forget everything.
051.025 --And this is what has emboldened you, Maximilian, this is what makes my life both very sweet and very unhappy, so much so that I often ask myself which is better for me, the grief that my mother-in-law's rigor and her blind preference for her child once caused me, or the happiness full of danger that I enjoy in seeing you.
051.026 --Danger!" cried Maximilian; "can you say a word so harsh and so unjust? Have you ever seen a more submissive slave than I? You allowed me to speak to you sometimes, Valentine, but you forbade me to follow you; I obeyed. Since I found the means to slip into this enclosure, to talk with you through this door, to be finally so close to you without seeing you, have I ever, tell me, asked to touch the bottom of your dress through these gates? Have I ever taken a step to cross this wall, ridiculous obstacle for my youth and my strength? Never a reproach on your rigor, never a desire expressed aloud; I was riveted to my word like a knight of the past times. Admit that at least, so that I do not believe you unjust.
051.027 -It is true, said Valentine, passing between two boards the tip of one of her slender fingers on which Maximilian placed his lips; it is true, you are an honest friend. But after all you only acted with a sense of self-interest, my dear Maximilian; you knew well that the day the slave became demanding, he would have to lose everything. You promised me the friendship of a brother, to me who has no friends, to me whom my father forgets, to me whom my stepmother persecutes, and who has for consolation only the immobile, mute, icy old man, whose hand cannot shake my hand, whose eye alone can speak to me, and whose heart beats for me with a remnant of warmth. Bitter derision of the fate which makes me enemy and victim of all those who are stronger than me, and which gives me a corpse for support and friend! Oh! truly, Maximilian, I repeat to you, I am very unhappy, and you are right to love me for me and not for you.
051. 028 --Valentine, said the young man with deep emotion, I will not say that I love only you in the world, for I also love my sister and my brother-in-law, but it is a gentle and calm love, which is nothing like the feeling I have for you: when I think of you, my blood boils, my chest swells, my heart overflows; but this strength, this ardor, this superhuman power, I will use them to love you only until the day when you tell me to use them to serve you. Mr. Franz d'Épinay will be absent for another year, they say; in one year, how many favorable chances can serve us, how many events can assist us! Let us hope therefore always, it is so good and so sweet to hope! But in the meantime, you, Valentine, you who reproach me for my selfishness, what have you been to me? The beautiful and cold statue of the modest Venus. In exchange for this devotion, this obedience, this restraint, what have you promised me? Nothing; what have you granted me? very little. You speak to me of M. d'Épinay, your fiancé, and you sigh at the idea of being one day his. Let's see, Valentine, is that all you have in your soul? What! I commit my life to you, I give you my soul, I consecrate to you even the most insignificant beat of my heart, and when I am all yours, when I say to myself softly that I will die if I lose you, you are not frightened at the only idea of belonging to another! Oh! Valentine! Valentine, if I were what you are, if I felt loved as you are sure I love you, already a hundred times I would have passed my hand between the bars of this gate, and shaken the hand of poor Maximilian and said to him: "To you, to you alone, Maximilian, in this world and in the next."
051.029 Valentine answered nothing, but the young man heard her sigh and cry.
051.030 The reaction was swift on Maximilian.
051.031 "Oh!" he cried, "Valentine! Valentine! forget my words, if there is anything in my words that could have hurt you!
051.032 --No," she said, "you are right; but don't you see that I am a poor creature, abandoned in a house that is almost a stranger to me, for my father is almost a stranger to me, and whose will has been broken for ten years, day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute, by the iron will of the masters who weigh upon me? No one sees what I suffer and I have told no one but you. In appearance, and in the eyes of everyone, everything is good to me, everything is affectionate; in reality, everything is hostile to me. The world says: "M. de Villefort is too serious and too severe to be very tender towards his daughter; but she has at least had the happiness of finding in Mme. de Villefort a second mother." Well, the world is mistaken, my father abandons me with indifference, and my stepmother hates me with a fierceness all the more terrible because it is veiled by an eternal smile.
051.033 --Hate you! You, Valentine! and how can anyone hate you?
051.034 -- Alas! my friend, said Valentine, I am forced to confess that this hatred for me comes from an almost natural feeling. She adores her son, my brother Edward.
051.035 --Well?
051.036 -- Well, it seems strange to me to mix up a question of money with what we were saying, well, my friend, I believe that her hatred comes from there at least. As she has no fortune of her own, as I am already rich from my mother, and as this fortune will be more than doubled by that of M. and Mme. de Saint-Méran, which must come to me one day, well, I think she is envious. Oh, my God! If I could give her half of this fortune and find myself at M. de Villefort's house like a daughter in her father's house, I would certainly do it right now.
051.037 --Poor Valentine!
051.038 -- Yes, I feel chained, and at the same time I feel so weak, that it seems to me that these bonds support me, and that I am afraid to break them. Besides, my father is not a man whose orders can be broken with impunity: he is powerful against me, he would be against you, he would be against the king himself, protected as he is by an irreproachable past and by an almost unassailable position. Oh, Maximilian, I swear to you, I am not fighting, because it is you as much as I am afraid of breaking in this fight.
051.039 -But, Valentine," said Maximilian, "why do you despair so much, and see the future always dark?
051.040 --Ah, my friend, because I judge it by the past.
051.041 -- Let us see, however, if I am not an illustrious party from the aristocratic point of view, I am, however, in many respects connected with the world in which you live; the time when there were two Frances in France no longer exists; the highest families of the monarchy have merged into the families of the Empire: the aristocracy of the lance has married the nobility of the cannon. Well, I belong to the latter: I have a beautiful future in the army, I enjoy a limited but independent fortune; the memory of my father, finally, is venerated in our country as that of one of the most honest merchants who existed. I say our country, Valentine, because you are almost from Marseille.
051.042 --Don't talk to me about Marseilles, Maximilian, that one word reminds me of my good mother, that angel whom everybody missed, and who, after having watched over her daughter during her short stay on earth, still watches over her, I hope, during her eternal stay in heaven. Oh, if my poor mother were alive, Maximilian, I would have nothing more to fear; I would tell her that I love you, and she would protect us.
051.043 -- Alas! Valentine," said Maximilian, "if she were alive, I would not know you, because, as you said, you would be happy if she were alive, and Valentine would have looked at me with great disdain from the height of her grandeur.
051.044 --Ah! my friend, cried Valentine, it is you who are unjust in your turn.... But, tell me....
051.045 --What do you want me to say?" continued Maximilian, seeing that Valentine hesitated.
051.046 -Tell me," continued the young girl, "did your father and mine ever have any disagreement in Marseilles?
051.047 -- No, not that I know of, replied Maximilian, it is only that your father was a more than zealous supporter of the Bourbons, and mine a man devoted to the Emperor. That, I presume, is all there ever was of dissent between them. But why this question, Valentine?
051.048 --I will tell you," continued the young girl, "for you must know everything. Well, it was the day when your nomination as an officer of the Legion of Honor was published in the newspaper. We were all at my grandfather's house, M. Noirtier, and there was also M. Danglars, you know that banker whose horses almost killed my mother and my brother the day before yesterday? I was reading the newspaper aloud to my grandfather while these gentlemen were talking about Miss Danglars' marriage. When I came to the paragraph which concerned you and which I had already read, because the day before in the morning you had announced this good news to me; when I came, I say, to the paragraph which concerned you, I was very happy... but also very trembling to be forced to pronounce your name aloud and certainly I would have omitted it without the fear that I felt that my silence would be misinterpreted; therefore I gathered all my courage, and I read.
051.049 --Dear Valentine!
051.050 -- Well, as soon as your name rang out, my father turned his head. I was so convinced (see how crazy I am!) that everyone was going to be struck by this name as if by a thunderbolt, that I thought I saw my father flinch and even (for that one it was an illusion, I am sure), and even Mr. Danglars.
051.051 "--Morrel," said my father, "wait! (He frowned.) "Could it be one of those Morrel from Marseilles, one of those enraged Bonapartists who gave us so much trouble in 1815?
051.052 "--Yes," replied M. Danglars; "I even think it is the son of the former shipowner."
051.053 --Really!" said Maximilian. And what did your father say, Valentine?
051.054 --Oh, a dreadful thing, and I dare not tell you again.
051.055 --Say always, Maximilian continued, smiling.
051.056 "--Their Emperor," he continued, frowning, "knew how to put all these fanatics in their place: he called them cannon fodder, and that was the only name they deserved. I see with joy that the new government puts back in force this salutary principle. If it were only for this reason that it keeps Algeria, I would congratulate the government, even though it costs us a little.
051.057 -This is indeed a rather brutal policy, said Maximilian. But do not be ashamed, dear friend, of what M. de Villefort said there; my brave father yielded nothing to yours on this point, and he kept repeating: "Why then does the Emperor, who does so many beautiful things, not make a regiment of judges and lawyers, and does not always send them to the first fire?" You see, dear friend, the parties are equal for the picturesqueness of the expression and for the sweetness of the thought. But M. Danglars, what does he say to this outburst from the King's prosecutor?
051.058 --Oh! he began to laugh with that sly laugh which is peculiar to him and which I find ferocious; then they rose the next moment and left. I only saw then that my grandfather was all agitated. I must tell you, Maximilian, that I alone can guess the agitation of this poor paralytic, and I suspected that the conversation that had taken place in front of him (for one no longer pays attention to him, poor grandfather!) had made a strong impression on him, since they had spoken ill of his Emperor, and that, as it seems, he was a fanatic of the Emperor.
051.059 --It is, indeed, says Maximilian, one of the known names of the empire: he was a senator, and, as you know or as you do not know, Valentine, he was close to all the Bonapartist conspiracies that were made under the Restoration.
051.060 --Yes, I sometimes hear these things said in a whisper, which seem strange to me: the Bonapartist grandfather, the royalist father; well, what do you want? So I turned to him. He showed me the newspaper with his eyes.
051.061 "--What have you got, Dad?" I said to him; "are you happy?
051.062 He nodded his head in agreement.
051.063 "--What did my father just say?" I asked.
051.064 He nodded no.
051.065 "--From what Mr. Danglars said?"
051.066 He made a sign that not yet.
051.067 "--So it is because M. Morrel, I dared not say Maximilian, has been named an officer of the Legion of Honor?"
051.068 He nodded.
051.069 -Would you believe it, Maximilien? He was happy that you were made an officer of the Legion of Honor, he who does not know you. It may be madness on his part, for he turns, they say, to childhood: but I like him for that.
051.070 -This is strange, Maximilian thought. Your father would hate me, while on the contrary your grandfather... Strange things, these loves and hates of parties!
051.071 -Hush!" cried Valentine suddenly. Hide, run away; they are coming!"
051.072 Maximilian jumped on a spade and began to turn over the alfalfa mercilessly.
051.073 "Miss! Mademoiselle!" cried a voice behind the trees, "Mme. de Villefort is looking for you everywhere and is calling you; there is a visit to the salon.
051.074 --A visit!" said Valentine, all agog; "and who is making us this visit?
051.075 --A great lord, a prince, so they say, M. the Count of Monte Cristo.
051.076 -- I go there," said Valentine aloud.
051.077 This name made the one to whom Valentine's "I'm going" served as a farewell at the end of each interview flinch on the other side of the gate.
051.078 "Well," said Maximilien to himself, leaning thoughtfully on his spade, "how does the Count of Monte Cristo know M. de Villefort?"
052.000 Toxicology.
052.001 It was really M. le Comte de Monte-Cristo who had just entered Mme de Villefort's house, with the intention of returning to M. le Procureur du Roi the visit he had made to her, and at this name the whole house, as is well understood, had been set in motion.
052. 002 Mme. de Villefort, who was in the drawing-room when the count was announced, immediately sent for her son to reiterate his thanks to the count, and Edouard, who had not ceased to hear for two days of the great personage, hastened to come, not out of obedience to his mother, not to thank the count, but out of curiosity and to make some remark with which he could place one of those lazzies which made his mother say, "Oh, the naughty child! But I must forgive him, he has so much spirit!"
052.003 After the first customary courtesies, the count inquired about M. de Villefort.
052.004 "My husband is dining at M. le Chancelier's," replied the young woman; "he has just left at once, and he will be very sorry, I am sure, to have been deprived of the happiness of seeing you."
052.005 Two visitors who had preceded the Count into the salon, and who were devouring him with their eyes, withdrew after the reasonable time required both by politeness and by curiosity.
052.006 "By the way, what is your sister Valentine doing?" said Mme. de Villefort to Edouard; "let her be warned so that I may have the honor of introducing her to the Count.
052.007 --You have a daughter, madame? asked the count, but it must be a child?
052.008 --She is the daughter of M. de Villefort, replied the young woman; a daughter of a first marriage, a tall and beautiful person.
052.009 --But melancholy," interrupted young Edward, plucking the tail feathers of a magnificent macaw, which was crying out in pain on its golden perch, to make a small aigrette for his hat.
052.010 Mme de Villefort merely said:
052.011 "Silence, Edouard!
052.012 "This young fool is almost right, and repeats there what he has heard me say many times with pain, for Mlle de Villefort is, in spite of all we can do to distract her, of a sad character and a taciturn mood which often detract from the effect of her beauty. But she does not come; Edward, see why this is so.
052.013 --Because they look for her where she is not.
052.014 --Where are they looking for her?
052.015 --From Grandpa Noirtier.
052.016 -- And you think she's not there?
052.017 --No, no, no, no, no, she's not there," replied Edouard, humming.
052.018 --And where is she? If you know, tell me.
052.019 --She is under the big chestnut tree," continued the wicked boy, presenting, in spite of his mother's cries, live flies to the parrot, which seemed very fond of this kind of game.
052.020 Mme. de Villefort was extending her hand to ring the bell, and to indicate to the chambermaid the place where she would find Valentine, when the latter entered. She seemed sad, indeed, and looking at her attentively one could even have seen traces of tears in her eyes.
052. 021 Valentine, whom we have, carried away by the rapidity of the narrative, presented to our readers without making her known, was a tall and slender young girl of nineteen years, with light brown hair, dark blue eyes, a languid gait and marked by that exquisite distinction which characterized her mother; Her white and tapered hands, her pearly neck, her cheeks marbled with fleeting colors, gave her at first sight the air of one of these beautiful Englishwomen who have been compared rather poetically in their gaits to swans who are getting ready.
052.022 She thus entered, and, seeing near her mother the foreigner of whom she had already heard so much, she greeted without any minuteness of young girl and without lowering the eyes, with a grace which redoubled the attention of the count.
052.023 He rose to his feet.
052.024 "Miss de Villefort, my daughter-in-law," said Mme de Villefort to Monte Cristo, leaning back on her sofa and pointing with her hand to Valentine.
052.025 --And Monsieur le Comte de Monte-Cristo, King of China, Emperor of Cochinchina," said the young droll man, casting a sly glance at his sister.
052.026 For this time Mme. de Villefort paled, and almost became irritated with this domestic scourge who answered to the name of Edward; but, on the contrary, the count smiled and seemed to look at the child with complacency, which brought the joy and enthusiasm of his mother to a climax.
052.027 "But, madame," resumed the count, renewing the conversation and looking alternately at Mme. de Villefort and Valentine, "have I not already had the honor of seeing you and mademoiselle somewhere? Just now I was thinking about it; and when mademoiselle came in, her sight was one more glimmer of light thrown on a confused memory, forgive me for saying so.
052.028 --That is not likely, sir; Mlle. de Villefort does not like the world very much, and we rarely go out, said the young woman.
052.029 --And so it is not in the world that I have seen mademoiselle, as well as you, madame, as well as this charming rogue. The Parisian world, moreover, is absolutely unknown to me, for, I believe I have had the honor of telling you, I have been in Paris for some days. No, if you will permit me to remember... wait..."
052.030 The Count put his hand to his forehead as if to concentrate all his memories:
052.031 "No, it's outside... it's... I don't know... but it seems to me that this memory is inseparable from a beautiful sunshine and a kind of religious festival... mademoiselle was holding flowers in her hand; the child was running after a beautiful peacock in a garden, and you, madam, were under a cradled vine.... So help me, madam; don't the things I'm telling you here remind you of anything?
052.032 -- No, indeed," replied Mme. de Villefort; "and yet it seems to me, sir, that if I had met you somewhere, your memory would have remained with me.
052.033 --Monsieur le Comte may have seen us in Italy, said Valentine timidly.
052.034 -- Indeed, in Italy... it is possible, said Monte Cristo. You have traveled to Italy, mademoiselle?
052.035 --Madame and I went there two years ago. The doctors feared for my chest and had recommended the air of Naples to me. We went through Bologna, Perugia and Rome.
052.036 - "Oh, it is true, mademoiselle," cried Monte Cristo, as if this simple indication were enough to fix all his memories. It was at Perugia, on Corpus Christi, in the garden of the hostelry of the Post Office, where chance brought us together, you, mademoiselle, your son, and myself, that I remember having had the honor of seeing you.
052.037 -- I remember Perugia perfectly, sir, and the inn at the Post Office, and the party of which you speak to me," said Mme. de Villefort; "but I am ashamed of my poor memory, and I do not remember having had the honor of seeing you.
052.038 - "That is strange, nor do I," said Valentine, raising her beautiful eyes to Monte Cristo.
052.039 --Ah! I remember, said Edward.
052.040 --I will help you, madam," said the count. The day had been hot; you were waiting for horses that did not arrive because of the solemnity. Mademoiselle went away into the depths of the garden, and your son disappeared, running after the bird.
052.041 --I caught it, Mother; you know," said Edward, "I plucked three feathers from its tail.
052.042 --You, madame, remained under the vine cradle; do you not remember, while you were sitting on a stone bench and while, as I told you, Miss de Villefort and your son were absent, having talked for a long time with someone?
052.043 --Yes, indeed, yes," said the young woman, blushing, "I remember it, with a man wrapped in a long woolen coat... with a doctor, I think.
052.044 -- True, madam; that man was me; for a fortnight I had been living in that inn, I had cured my valet of fever and my guest of jaundice, so that I was considered a great doctor. We talked for a long time, Madam, about different things, about Perugino, Raphael, customs, costumes, and that famous aqua-tofana, of which some people, I believe you were told, still kept the secret in Perugia.
052.045 --Ah, it's true," said Mme. de Villefort, with some anxiety, "I remember.
052.046 --I no longer know what you are telling me in detail, madame," resumed the Count with perfect tranquillity, "but I remember perfectly that, sharing in the general error about me, you consulted me about the health of Mlle. de Villefort.
052.047 --But however, sir, you were really a doctor, said Mme de Villefort, since you cured patients.
052.048 --Molière or Beaumarchais would answer you, madame, that it is precisely because I was not a doctor that I did not cure my patients, but that my patients did cure me; I will content myself with telling you that I have studied chemistry and natural sciences thoroughly enough, but only as an amateur... you understand."
052.049 At this moment six o'clock struck.
052.050 "There's six o'clock," said Mme. de Villefort, visibly agitated; "aren't you going to see, Valentine, if your grandfather is ready for dinner?"
052.051 Valentine rose, and, saluting the count, left the room without uttering a word.
052.052 "Oh, my God, madame, is it because of me that you are dismissing Mlle. de Villefort?" said the count when Valentine had gone.
052.053 - "Not in the least," said the young woman, "but that is the hour at which we make M. Noirtier eat the sad meal that sustains his sad existence. You know, sir, in what lamentable state my husband's father is?
052.054 -- Yes, madame, M. de Villefort told me about it; a paralysis, I believe.
052.055 -- Yes, there is a complete absence of movement in this poor old man; the soul alone is watching in this human machine, and still pale and trembling, and like a lamp ready to go out. But forgive me, sir, for talking to you about our domestic misfortunes, I interrupted you when you were telling me that you were a skilled chemist.
052.056 -- "I was not saying that, madam," replied the Count with a smile; "on the contrary, I studied chemistry because, having decided to live particularly in the East, I wanted to follow the example of King Mithridates.
052.057 --_Mithridates, rex Ponticus_, said the dazed one, cutting out figures from a magnificent album, the same one who breakfasted every morning with a cup of creamy poison.
052.058 -- Edouard! you wicked child!" cried Mme. de Villefort, snatching the mutilated book from her son's hands, "you are unbearable, you are making us dizzy. Leave us, and go and join your sister Valentine at grandpa Noirtier's.
052.059 --The album... said Edouard.
052.060 --What do you mean, the album?
052.061 --Yes: I want the album....
052.062 --Why did you cut out the drawings?
052.063 --Because it amuses me.
052.064 --Get out! Go!
052.065 --I won't go away if they don't give me the album," said the child, settling into a large armchair, faithful to his habit of never giving in.
052.066 -Here, and leave us alone," said Mme de Villefort.
052.067 And she gave the album to Edward, who left accompanied by his mother.
052.068 The Count followed Mme de Villefort with his eyes.
052.069 "Let's see if she'll close the door behind him," he murmured.
052.070 Mme de Villefort closed the door with the greatest care behind the child; the Count did not seem to notice.
052.071 Then, with a last glance around her, the young woman returned to sit on her loveseat.
052.072 "Allow me to point out to you, madam," said the Count, with that good-naturedness that we know of him, "that you are very severe on this charming mischief-maker.
052.073 --It is necessary, sir," replied Mme. de Villefort with the true aplomb of a mother.
052.074 -- It was his Cornelius Nepos that Mr. Edward was reciting when he spoke of King Mithridates, said the Count, and you interrupted him in a quotation which proves that his tutor did not waste his time with him, and that your son is very advanced for his age.
052.075 - "The fact is, sir count," replied the gently flattered mother, "that he has great facility and learns everything he wants. He has only one fault, which is to be very voluntary; but, with regard to what he was saying, do you believe, for example, sir count, that Mithridate used these precautions and that these precautions could be effective?
052.076 -- I believe it so well, madam, that I, who am speaking to you, used it to avoid being poisoned in Naples, Palermo and Smyrna, that is to say, on three occasions where, without this precaution, I could have left my life.
052.077 --And did you succeed?
052.078 --Perfectly.
052.079 --Yes, it is true; I remember that you already told me something similar in Perugia.
052.080 --Really!" said the Count with admirably played surprise; "I don't remember.
052.081 --I asked you if poisons acted equally and with similar energy on the men of the North and on the men of the South, and you even answered me that the cold and lymphatic temperaments of the Septentrionals did not present the same aptitude as the rich and energetic nature of the people of the South.
052.082 --That is true, said Monte Cristo; I have seen Russians devour, without being bothered, vegetable substances that would have killed a Neapolitan or an Arab infallibly.
052.083 -So you believe that the result would be even more certain here than in the East, and that in the midst of our fogs and rains a man would get used to this gradual absorption of poison more easily than in a warm latitude?
052.084 --Certainly; of course, however, one will only be protected against the poison to which one is accustomed.
052.085 --Yes, I understand; and how would you get used to it, you, for example, or rather how did you get used to it?
052.086 --That's easy. Suppose you know in advance what poison must be used against you.... Suppose that this poison is... brucine, example....
052.087 --The brucine is derived from false angst, I believe, said Mme de Villefort.
052.088 --Justly, madame, replied Monte-Cristo; but I believe that I have not much left to teach you; receive my compliments: such knowledge is rare among women.
052.089 --Oh, I confess," said Mme. de Villefort, "I have the most violent passion for the occult sciences, which speak to the imagination like poetry, and are resolved into figures like an algebraic equation; but continue, I pray you: what you are telling me interests me to the highest degree.
052. 090 -- Well," resumed Monte Cristo, "suppose that this poison is brucine, for example, and that you take one milligram of it on the first day, two milligrams on the second, well, at the end of ten days you will have one centigram; at the end of twenty days, increasing by another milligram, you will have three centigrams, that is to say, a dose that you can bear without any inconvenience, and which would be very dangerous for another person who had not taken the same precautions as you; Finally, after a month, by drinking water from the same carafe, you will kill the person who drank the water at the same time as you, without realizing that there was any poisonous substance mixed with the water, except by a simple feeling of sickness.
052.091 -- Do you know of no other counter-poison?
052.092 -- I do not know of any.
052.093 -- I had often read and reread this story of Mithridate, said Mme de Villefort thoughtfully, and I had taken it for a fable.
052.094 -- No, madame; against the habit of history, it is a truth. But what you are telling me, madam, what you are asking me is not the result of a capricious question, since two years ago you already asked me similar questions, and you tell me that for a long time this story of Mithridates had been preoccupying you.
052.095 - It is true, sir, the two favorite studies of my youth were botany and mineralogy, and then, when I knew later that the use of the simple things often explained all the history of the people and all the life of the individuals of the East, as the flowers explain all their loving thought, I regretted not being a man to become a Flamel, a Fontana or a Cabanis.
052. 096 - All the more so, madam, Monte Cristo continued, since the Orientals do not limit themselves, like Mithridate, to making a breastplate of poisons, they also make a dagger of them; science becomes in their hands not only a defensive weapon, but also very often an offensive one; With opium, with belladonna, with false anguish, with snakewood, with cherry laurel, they put to sleep those who would like to wake them up. There is not one of these women, Egyptian, Turkish or Greek, whom you call good women here, who does not know enough chemistry to astound a doctor, and enough psychology to frighten a confessor.
052.097 -- Really! said Mme. de Villefort, whose eyes shone with a strange fire at this conversation.
052.098 -- "Oh, my God! yes, madame," continued Monte Cristo, "the secret dramas of the Orient are tied up and untied in this way, from the plant that makes one love to the plant that makes one die; from the drink that opens heaven to the one that plunges a man into hell. There are as many nuances of all kinds as there are caprices and oddities in human nature, physical and moral; and I will say more, the art of these chemists knows how to accommodate admirably the remedy and the evil to its needs of love or to its desires of revenge.
052.099 -But, sir," resumed the young woman, "these Oriental societies in the midst of which you have spent a part of your existence are therefore fantastic like the tales that come to us from their beautiful country? can a man be suppressed there with impunity? is it really the Baghdad or the Basra of M. Galland? Are the sultans and viziers who govern these societies, and who constitute what is called in France the government, seriously Haroun-al-Raschid and Giaffar, who not only forgive a poisoner, but also make him prime minister if the crime has been ingenious, and who, in this case, have the history of it engraved in golden letters to entertain themselves in the hours of their boredom?
052.100 -- No, madam, the fantastic no longer exists even in the Orient: there are there too, disguised under other names and hidden under other costumes, police commissioners, examining magistrates, king's attorneys and experts. Criminals are hanged, beheaded and impaled with great pleasure; but they, as skilful fraudsters, have been able to evade human justice and ensure the success of their undertakings by skilful combinations. In our country, a fool possessed by the demon of hatred or greed, who has an enemy to destroy or a grandparent to annihilate, goes to a grocer, gives him a false name which makes him discover it much better than his real name, and buys, under the pretext that the rats prevent him from sleeping, five or six grams of arsenic If he is very clever, he goes to five or six grocers, and is only five or six times better recognized; then, when he has his specific, he administers to his enemy, to his grandparent, a dose of arsenic that would make a mammoth or a mastodon die, and that, without rhyme or reason, makes the victim scream, which puts the whole neighborhood in turmoil. Then a swarm of police officers and gendarmes arrive, a doctor is sent for, who cuts open the dead man and collects the arsenic with a spoon in his stomach and entrails. The next day, a hundred newspapers tell the story with the name of the victim and the murderer. The very same evening, the grocer or grocers come or come to say, "It was I who sold the arsenic to the gentleman." And rather than not recognizing the purchaser, they will recognize twenty; then the criminal fool is caught, imprisoned, interrogated, confronted, confounded, condemned and guillotined; or if it is a woman of some value, she is locked up for life. That's how your Septentrionals understand chemistry, madam. Desrues however was stronger than that, I must confess.
052.101 --What do you want! sir," said the young woman laughing, "one does what one can. Not everyone has the secret of the Medici or the Borgia.
052.102 - "Now," said the Count, shrugging his shoulders, "would you like me to tell you what causes all this nonsense? It is that in your theaters, as far as I have been able to judge by reading the plays that are performed there, one always sees people swallow the contents of a vial or bite the bezel of a ring and fall down dead: five minutes later, the curtain comes down; the spectators are dispersed. The aftermath of the murder is unknown; neither the police commissioner with his scarf, nor the corporal with his four men are ever seen, and this allows many poor brains to believe that things happen like that. But go out of France for a little while, go either to Aleppo or Cairo, or only to Naples and Rome, and you will see straight, fresh, rosy people passing through the street, whose lame devil, if he brushed you with his coat, could say to you, "This gentleman has been poisoned for three weeks, and he will be quite dead in a month."
052.103 -- "But then," said Mme. de Villefort, "they have found the secret of that famous aqua-tofana which I was told was lost in Perugia.
052.104 --Eh, my God! madame, is something lost among men! The arts move around the world; things change names, that's all, and the common people are mistaken; but it's always the same result, the poison affects this or that organ in particular; one on the stomach, the other on the brain, the other on the intestines. Well, the poison determines a cough, this cough a fluxion of chest or such other disease catalogued in the book of science, which does not prevent it from being perfectly mortal, and which, if it were not so, would become so thanks to the remedies administered by the naive doctors, generally very bad chemists, and who will turn for or against the disease, as you please, and here is a man killed with art and in all the rules, about whom justice has nothing to learn, as said a horrible chemist of my friends, the excellent Abbot Ademonte of Taormina, in Sicily, who had studied these national phenomena a great deal.
052.105 -It is frightening, but it is admirable, said the young woman, immobile with attention; I confess that I thought all these stories were inventions of the Middle Ages?
052.106 --Yes, no doubt, but they have been perfected in our day. What is the use of time, of encouragement, of medals, of crosses, of Montyon prizes, if not to lead society to its greatest perfection? Now, man will not be perfect until he knows how to create and destroy as God knows how to destroy; that is half the road.
052.107 -So, Mme de Villefort continued, invariably returning to her goal, that the poisons of the Borgias, the Medici, the Rene, the Ruggieri, and later probably the Baron de Trenk, which have been so abused by modern drama and novels....
052.108 --Were objects of art, madam, not anything else, replied the count. Do you think that the true scientist addresses himself banally to the individual? No, I do not. Science likes ricochets, tricks, fantasy, if one can say that. Thus, for example, that excellent abbot Adelmonte, of whom I spoke to you just now, had made some astonishing experiments in this respect.
052.109 -- Really!
052.110 -- Yes, I'll tell you just one. He had a beautiful garden full of vegetables, flowers, and fruit; among these vegetables he chose the most honest of all, a cabbage, for example. For three days he would water this cabbage with a solution of arsenic; on the third day, the cabbage became sick and yellowed, and it was time to cut it; for everyone it looked ripe and kept its honest appearance: for Abbot Adelmonte alone it was poisoned. So he took the cabbage home, took a rabbit--Fr. Adelmonte had a collection of rabbits, cats, and guinea pigs that was second only to his collection of vegetables, flowers, and fruit--Fr. Adelmonte took a rabbit and made it eat a cabbage leaf, and the rabbit died. Who is the examining magistrate who would dare to find fault with this, and who is the public prosecutor who ever dared to draw up an indictment against Mr. Magendie or Mr. Flourens concerning the rabbits, guinea pigs and cats they killed? No. So the rabbit died without the justice system being concerned. Father Adelmonte had his cook gut the dead rabbit and throw the intestines on a dung heap. On this dunghill, there is a hen, she pecks at the intestines, falls ill in turn and dies the next day. As she struggles in the convulsions of agony, a vulture passes by (there are many vultures in the country of Adelmonte), that one melts on the corpse, carries it on a rock and eats it. Three days later, the poor vulture, which, since this meal, has been constantly indisposed, feels dizzy at the highest point of the nakedness; it rolls in the void and comes to fall heavily in your fish tank; the pike, the eel and the moray eel eat greedily, you know that, they bite the vulture .... Well, suppose that the next day this eel, this pike or this moray eel, poisoned in the fourth generation, is served on your table, your guest will be poisoned in the fifth generation and will die after eight or ten days of pain in the entrails, of heartache, of abscesses in the pylorus. An autopsy will be performed, and the doctors will say, "The subject died of a liver tumor or typhoid fever."
052.111 --But, said Mme. de Villefort, all these circumstances, which you link together, can be broken by the slightest accident; the vulture may not pass in time or fall a hundred paces from the fish tank.
052.112 --Ah, that is precisely where the art lies: to be a great chemist in the East, one must direct chance; one arrives there."
052.113 Mme. de Villefort was dreamy and listened.
052.114 "But," she said, "arsenic is indelible; in whatever way it is absorbed, it will be found in the body of man, from the moment it has entered in sufficient quantity to give death.
052.115 - "Good!" exclaimed Monte Cristo, "good! That is precisely what I am saying to this good Adelmonte.
052.116 "He reflected, smiled, and answered me with a Sicilian proverb, which is also, I believe, a French proverb: "My child, the world was not made in one day, but in seven; come back on Sunday."
052.117 "The following Sunday I returned; instead of having sprinkled his cabbage with arsenic, he had sprinkled it with a low salt dissolution of strychnine, _strychnos colubrina_, as the scholars say. This time the cabbage didn't look the least bit sick, so the rabbit didn't mind, so five minutes later the rabbit was dead; the hen ate the rabbit, and the next day she was dead. Then we became vultures, took the hen and opened her up. This time all the particular symptoms had disappeared, and only the general symptoms remained. No particular indication in any organ; exasperation of the nervous system, that's all, and trace of cerebral congestion, neither; the hen had not been poisoned, she had died of apoplexy. This is a rare case in hens, I know, but very common in men."
052.118 Mme de Villefort looked more and more dreamy.
052.119 "It is fortunate," she said, "that such substances can only be prepared by chemists, for, in truth, half the world would poison the other.
052.120 --Per chemists or people who deal with chemistry, replied Monte Cristo carelessly.
052.121 --And then," said Mme de Villefort, pulling herself out of her thoughts with effort, "however cleverly prepared it may be, crime is always crime: and if it escapes human investigation, it does not escape the gaze of God. The Orientals are stronger than we are in cases of conscience, and have prudently suppressed hell; that is all.
052.122 --Eh! madam, this is a scruple which must naturally arise in an honest soul like yours, but which would soon be uprooted by reasoning. The bad side of human thought will always be summed up by that paradox of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, you know: "The mandarin whom one kills at five thousand leagues by raising the tip of his finger." Man's life is spent doing such things, and his intelligence is exhausted in dreaming them. You will find very few people who will brutally stick a knife in the heart of their fellow man or who will administer, to make him disappear from the face of the earth, that quantity of arsenic that we were saying earlier. This is really eccentricity or stupidity. To get there, the blood must heat up to thirty-six degrees, the pulse must beat at ninety, and the soul must go beyond its ordinary limits; but if, passing, as is the practice in philology, from the word to the mixed synonym, you make a simple elimination; instead of committing an ignoble murder, if you purely and simply remove from your way the one who hinders you, and that without shock, without violence, without the apparatus of those sufferings, which, becoming a torture, make of the victim a martyr, and of the one who acts a carnifex in all the force of the word; if there is neither blood, nor howling, nor contortions, nor especially this horrible and compromising instantaneity of the achievement, then you escape the blow of the human law which says to you: "Do not disturb society! " This is how the people of the East proceed and succeed, serious and phlegmatic characters, who worry little about questions of time in conjunctures of a certain importance.
052.123 -- "There remains conscience," said Mme. de Villefort in an agitated voice and with a stifled sigh.
052.124 -- Yes," said Monte Cristo, "fortunately there is still conscience, without which one would be very unhappy. After any action that is a little vigorous, it is conscience that saves us, for it provides us with a thousand good excuses of which only we are the judges; and these reasons, however excellent they may be for preserving our sleep, would perhaps be mediocre in a court of law for preserving our lives. Thus Richard III, for example, must have been wonderfully served by conscience after the suppression of the two children of Edward IV, indeed, he could say to himself, "These two children of a cruel and persecuting king, and who had inherited their father's vices, which only I could recognize in their juvenile inclinations; these two children were in the way of my making the felicity of the English people, whose misfortune they would infallibly have made." Thus was served by her conscience Lady Macbeth, who wanted, whatever Shakespeare said, to give a throne, not to her husband, but to her son. Ah! maternal love is such a great virtue, such a powerful motive, that it excuses many things; also, after Duncan's death, Lady Macbeth would have been very unhappy without her conscience."
052.125 Mme. de Villefort greedily absorbed these frightful maxims and horrible paradoxes spouted by the Count with that naive irony which was peculiar to him.
052.126 Then after a moment's silence
052.127 "Do you know," she said, "Monsieur le Comte, that you are a terrible arguer, and that you see the world in a somewhat livid light! Is it then by looking at humanity through stills and retorts that you have judged it as such? For you were right, you are a great chemist, and this elixir that you made my son take, and which so quickly recalled him to life....
052.128 --Oh, don't be fooled, madam," said Monte Cristo, "one drop of this elixir was enough to call back to life this child who was dying, but three drops would have pushed the blood to his lungs in such a way as to give him a heartbeat; six would have cut off his breathing, and caused a syncope much more serious than the one in which he was; ten finally would have struck him down. Do you know, madam, how quickly I pushed him away from those bottles which he had the imprudence to touch?
052.129 --So it is a terrible poison?
052.130 --Oh, my God, no! First of all, let us admit that the word poison does not exist, since in medicine we use the most violent poisons, which become, by the way they are administered, salutary remedies.
052.131 -- What was it then?
052.132 -- It was a learned preparation of my friend, the excellent Abbot Adelmonte, and which he taught me to use.
052.133 --Oh! said Mme de Villefort, it must be an excellent antispasmodic.
052.134 --Sovereign, madam, you have seen it, replied the Count, and I make frequent use of it, with all possible caution, of course, he added with a laugh.
052.135 --I believe so, replied Mme. de Villefort in the same tone. As for me, so nervous and so quick to faint, I would need a doctor Adelmonte to invent for me ways of breathing freely and to calm me about the fear I have of dying one day of suffocation. In the meantime, as the thing is difficult to find in France, and as your abbot is probably not willing to make the trip to Paris for me, I stick to Mr. Planche's antispasmodics, and mint and Hoffmann's drops play a great role in my case. Here are some pastilles that I have made for myself on purpose; they are in double doses."
052.136 Monte Cristo opened the shell box presented to him by the young woman, and inhaled the smell of the pastilles as a worthy amateur to appreciate this preparation.
052.137 "They are exquisite," he said, "but subject to the necessity of swallowing, a function which is often impossible to perform on the part of the fainting person. I like my specific better.
052.138 --But, of course, I too would prefer it according to the effects I have seen of it above all; but that is a secret without doubt, and I am not indiscreet enough to ask you.
052.139 --But I, madam," said Monte Cristo, rising, "am gallant enough to offer it to you.
052.140 -- Oh, sir.
052.141 --Simply remember one thing: it is that in small doses it is a remedy, in large doses it is a poison. One drop gives life, as you have seen; five or six would infallibly kill, and in a way all the more terrible, since if they were spread in a glass of wine, they would not change the taste at all. But I stop, madam, I would almost seem to be advising you."
052.142 Half past six, a friend of Mme. de Villefort's was announced, who was coming to dine with her.
052.143 "If I had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time, Monsieur le Comte, instead of seeing you for the second," said Mme. de Villefort; "if I had the honor of being your friend, instead of simply having the happiness of being your obligee, I would insist on keeping you to dinner, and I would not let myself be beaten by a first refusal.
052.144 "A thousand pardons, madam," replied Monte Cristo, "I have an engagement of my own which I cannot fail to keep. I promised to take a Greek princess of my friends to the show, who has not yet seen the Grand Opera, and who is counting on me to take her there.
052.145 - Go, sir, but don't forget my recipe.
052.146 --How can I, madam? For that, I would have to forget the hour of conversation I have just spent with you, which is quite impossible.
052.147 Monte Cristo saluted and left.
052.148 Mme de Villefort remained dreamy.
052.149 "Here is a strange man," she said, "who seems to me to be called, by his Christian name, Adelmonte.
052.150 As for Monte Cristo, the result had exceeded his expectations.
052.151 "Come on," he said as he went away, "this is good soil, I am convinced that the grain that is dropped on it does not abort."
052.152 And the next day, true to his promise, he sent the requested revenue.
053.000 Robert the Devil.
053.001 The reason for the Opera was all the better to give as there was a solemnity that evening at the Royal Academy of Music. Levasseur, after a long indisposition, was returning to the role of Bertram, and, as always, the work of the fashionable maestro had attracted the most brilliant society in Paris.
053.002 Morcerf, like most rich young men, had his orchestra stall, plus ten boxes of people he knew to whom he could go to ask for a seat, not counting the one to which he was entitled in the lions' box.
053.003 Château-Renaud had the stall next to his.
053.004 Beauchamp, as a journalist, was king of the room and had a seat everywhere.
053.005 That evening Lucien Debray had the use of the minister's box, and he had offered it to Count de Morcerf, who, on Mercédès's refusal, had sent it to Danglars, telling him that he would probably pay a visit to the baroness and her daughter in the evening, if these ladies would accept the box he offered them. These ladies had not been able to refuse. No one is fond of boxes that cost nothing like a millionaire.
053.006 As for Danglars, he had declared that his political principles and his quality of deputy of the opposition did not allow him to go in the lodge of the minister. Consequently, the baroness had written to Lucien to come to take her, whereas she could not go to the Opera alone with Eugénie.
053.007 Indeed, if the two women had been alone, one would certainly have found it very bad; whereas Mlle Danglars going to the Opera with her mother and her mother's lover there was nothing to say: one must take the world as it is made.
053.008 The canvas rose, as usual, over a nearly empty room. It is still a habit of our Parisian fashion to arrive at the show when the performance has begun: the result is that the first act is spent, on the part of the spectators who have arrived, not watching or listening to the play, but watching the spectators who are arriving enter, and hearing nothing but the noise of the doors and that of conversations.
053.009 "Well," said Albert suddenly, as he saw a box on the side of the first row open, "well, the Countess G..."
053.010 --What is the Countess G...? asked Château-Renaud.
053.011 --Oh! for example, baron, here is a question that I do not forgive you; you ask what the Countess G... is?
053.012 --Ah, that's true, said Château-Renaud, isn't it that charming Venetian?
053.013 --Just so."
053.014 At this moment the Countess G... saw Albert and exchanged with him a greeting accompanied by a smile.
053.015 "You know her?" said Château-Renaud.
053.016 --Yes, said Albert; I was introduced to her in Rome by Franz.
053.017 --Will you do me the same service in Paris that Franz did you in Rome?
053.018 --I would like to.
053.019 --Hush!" shouted the audience.
053.020 The two young people continued their conversation, without seeming to be the least bit concerned about the desire of the audience to hear the music.
053.021 "She was at the Champ-de-Mars races," said Château-Renaud.
053.022 -Today?
053.023 --Yes.
053.024 --There were races, by the way. Were you engaged?
053.025 --Oh! for a pittance, for fifty pounds.
053.026 --And who won?
053.027 --Nautilus; I was betting for him.
053.028 --But there were three races?
053.029 --Yes. There was the Jockey-Club prize, a gold cup. Something rather strange even happened.
053.030 --What was it?
053.031 --Shut up!" shouted the audience.
053.032 -What? repeated Albert.
053.033 --A completely unknown horse and jockey won this race.
053.034 --How?
053.035 --Oh, my God, yes, no one had paid any attention to a horse entered under the name of _Vampa_ and a jockey entered under the name of _Job_, when suddenly an admirable chestnut and a jockey as big as a fist were seen to come forward; they were obliged to stuff twenty pounds of lead into his pockets, which did not prevent him from reaching the finish three horse-lengths before _Ariel and Barbaro_, who were running with him.
053.036 --And it was not known whose horse and jockey it was?
053.037 -- No.
053.038 --You say this horse was registered under the name of ....
053.039 --_Vampa_.
053.040 --So, says Albert, I am more advanced than you, I know to whom it belonged.
053.041 --Silence then!" shouted for the third time the audience.
053.042 This time the outcry was so great that the two young people finally realized that it was to them that the public was speaking. They turned around for a moment, looking in this crowd for a man who would take responsibility for what they considered an impertinence; but no one repeated the invitation, and they turned back to the stage. At this moment the minister's box opened, and Mme. Danglars, her daughter, and Lucien Debray took their places.
053.043 "Ah! ah!" said Château-Renaud, "here are people of your acquaintance, viscount. What on earth are you looking at on the right? One is looking for you."
053.044 Albert turned and his eyes actually met those of the Baroness Danglars, who gave him a little salute with her fan. As for Mlle. Eugenie, it was scarcely if her large black eyes deigned to lower themselves to the orchestra.
053.045 "In truth, my dear," said Château-Renaud, "I do not understand, apart from the misalliance, and I do not believe that this is what concerns you very much; I do not understand, I say, apart from the misalliance, what you can have against Miss Danglars; she is in truth a very beautiful person.
053.046 --Such a beautiful person, certainly, said Albert; but I confess that in terms of beauty I would prefer something softer, more suave, more feminine, at last.
053.047 --That is what young people are like, said Château-Renaud, who, as a man of thirty, took on a paternal air with Morcerf; they are never satisfied. How, my dear! you find a fiancée built on the model of Diana the Huntress, and you are not satisfied!
053.048 -- Well, precisely, I would have liked better something in the style of the Venus of Milo or of Capua. This Diana huntress, always in the middle of her nymphs, frightens me a little, I am afraid that she treats me like Actaeon."
053.049 Indeed, a glance at the girl could almost explain the feeling Morcerf had just confessed. Mlle. Danglars was beautiful, but, as Albert had said, of a somewhat arrested beauty: her hair was of a beautiful black, but in its natural waves one noticed a certain rebellion to the hand which wanted to impose its will on them; her eyes, black as her hair, framed under magnificent eyebrows which had only one defect, that of frowning sometimes, were especially remarkable by an expression of firmness which one was astonished to find in the glance of a woman; her nose had the exact proportions that a statuary would have given to that of Juno: Her mouth alone was too large, but garnished with beautiful teeth which were still highlighted by lips whose bright carmine contrasted with the paleness of her complexion; finally a black sign placed at the corner of the mouth, and wider than are usually these kinds of caprices of nature, completed to give to this physiognomy this decided character which frightened Morcerf a little.
053.050 Besides, all the rest of Eugenie's person was in harmony with this face which we have just tried to describe. It was, as Château-Renaud had said, the Diana the Huntress, but with something even firmer and more muscular in her beauty.
053.051 As for her education, which she had received, if there was a reproach to be made, it was that, like certain points of her physiognomy, she seemed to belong a little to another sex. Indeed, she spoke two or three languages, drew easily, made verses and composed music; she was especially passionate about this last art, which she studied with one of her boarding school friends, a young person without any fortune, but with all the possible dispositions to become, as one was assured, an excellent singer. It was said that a great composer took an almost paternal interest in her and made her work with the hope that one day she would find a fortune in her voice.
053.052 The possibility that Mlle Louise d'Armilly, that was the name of the young virtuoso, might one day enter the theater meant that Mlle Danglars, although she received her at home, did not appear in public in her company. Moreover, without having in the banker's house the independent position of a friend, Louise had a position superior to that of the ordinary schoolteacher.
053.053 A few seconds after Mme. Danglars entered her dressing room, the curtain had fallen and, thanks to the faculty, left by the length of the intermissions, of walking around the foyer or making visits for half an hour, the orchestra had more or less cleared out.
053.054 Morcerf and Château-Renaud had left first. For a moment Mme. Danglars had thought that this eagerness of Albert's was intended to come and present his compliments to her, and she had leaned over to her daughter's ear to announce this visit, but the latter had contented herself with shaking her head and smiling; and at the same time, as if to prove how well-founded Eugenie's denial was, Morcerf appeared in a dressing room to the side of the first row. This box was that of the Countess G...
053.055 "Ah! there you are, Monsieur le voyageur," said the latter, extending her hand with all the cordiality of an old acquaintance; "it is very kind of you to have recognized me, and especially to have given me preference for your first visit.
053.056 - "Believe me, madam," replied Albert, "if I had known of your arrival in Paris and your address, I would not have waited so late. But please allow me to introduce you to M. le baron de Château-Renaud, my friend, one of the rare gentlemen who still remain in France, and through whom I have just learned that you were at the races of the Champ-de-Mars."
053.057 Château-Renaud saluted.
053.058 "Ah! you were at the races, sir?" said the countess sharply.
053.059 --Yes, madame.
053.060 --Well," continued Mrs. G., "can you tell me whose horse won the Jockey Club prize?
053.061 -- No, madam," said Château-Renaud, "and I was asking Albert the same question just now.
053.062 -- Do you care much for it, Madame Countess? asked Albert.
053.063 -- To what?
053.064 -- To know the master of the horse?
053.065 --Infinitely. Imagine.... But would you know who, by any chance, Viscount?
053.066 --Madam, you were going to tell a story: imagine yourself, you said.
053.067 -- Well, imagine that this charming chestnut horse and this pretty little jockey in a pink cap had, at the first sight, inspired such a lively sympathy in me, that I was wishing for both of them, exactly as if I had committed half my fortune to them; also, when I saw them arrive at the goal, ahead of the other riders by three horse-lengths, I was so joyful that I began to clap my hands like a madwoman. Imagine my astonishment when, on my way home, I met the little pink jockey on my stairs! I thought that the winner of the race was by chance staying in the same house as me, when, on opening the door of my living room, the first thing I saw was the golden cup which formed the prize won by the unknown horse and jockey. In the cup was a small piece of paper on which were written these words: "To the Countess G--, Lord Ruthwen."
053.068 --That is just it, said Morcerf.
053.069 --How can that be? What do you mean?
053.070 --I mean that it is Lord Ruthwen himself.
053.071 --What Lord Ruthwen?
053.072 -- Ours, the vampire, the one from the Argentina theater.
053.073 --Really!" exclaimed the Countess, "is he here?
053.074 --Perfectly.
053.075 --And you see him? You receive him?
053.076 -He is my intimate friend, and M. de Château-Renaud himself has the honor of knowing him.
053.077 --Who can make you believe that it was he who won?
053.078 --His horse registered under the name of _Vampa_...
053.079 --Well, afterwards?
053.080 --Well, don't you remember the name of the famous bandit who took me prisoner?
053.081 --Ah, that's true.
053.082 --And from whose hands the Count miraculously rescued me?
053.083 --So done.
053.084 -- His name was Vampa. You can see that it was him.
053.085 --But why did he send me this cup?
053.086 --First of all, Madam Countess, because I had spoken to him a lot about you, as you can believe; then because he was delighted to find a compatriot, and happy about the interest that this compatriot took in him.
053.087 --I hope you never told him the nonsense we said about him!
053.088 --My goodness, I wouldn't swear to it, and this way of offering you this cup under the name of Lord Ruthwen....
053.089 --But it's awful, he's going to be mortally angry with me.
053.090 --Is his procedure that of an enemy?
053.091 --No, I admit it.
053.092 --Well!
053.093 --So he's in Paris?
053.094 --Yes.
053.095 --And what sensation did he make?
053.096 --But, said Albert, it was talked about for eight days, then came the coronation of the Queen of England and the theft of Miss Mars' diamonds, and that was all that was talked about.
053.097 -My dear, said Château-Renaud, it is clear that the count is your friend, you treat him accordingly. Do not believe what Albert tells you, Madame la Comtesse, on the contrary, it is only a question of the Count of Monte Cristo in Paris. He began by sending Mme. Danglars horses worth thirty thousand francs; then he saved Mme. de Villefort's life; then he won the Jockey Club race, so it seems. I maintain, on the contrary, whatever Morcerf may say, that the Count is still being taken care of at the moment, and that in a month's time he will be the only one to be taken care of, if he wants to continue to be eccentric, which, moreover, seems to be his ordinary way of life.
053.098 --That is possible, said Morcerf; in the meantime, who has taken over the Russian ambassador's box?
053.099 -Which one? asked the Countess.
053.100 --The inter-column of the first row; it seems to me to be perfectly restored.
053.101 -- Indeed, said Château-Renaud. Was anyone there during the first act?
053.102 --Where?
053.103 --In this dressing room?
053.104 -- No," said the Countess, "I saw no one; so," she continued, returning to the first conversation, "you believe that it was your Count of Monte Cristo who won the prize?
053.105 -- I am sure of it.
053.106 --And who sent me this cup?
053.107 -- Without a doubt.
053.108 --But I don't know him, said the Countess, and I have a strong desire to send it back to him.
053.109 --Oh, don't do anything about it; he'll send you another one, cut from some sapphire or carved from some ruby. These are his ways; what do you want, you have to take him as he is."
053.110 At this moment the bell was heard announcing that the second act was about to begin. Albert got up to return to his seat.
053.111 "Will I see you?" asked the Countess.
053.112 --During the intermissions, if you allow me, I will come to find out if I can be of any use to you in Paris.
053.113 --Messieurs, said the countess, every Saturday evening, rue de Rivoli, 22, I am at home for my friends. You are warned."
053.114 The young men saluted and went out.
053.115 As they entered the hall, they saw the audience standing and their eyes fixed on a single point in the room; their gaze followed the general direction, and stopped on the former box of the Russian ambassador. A man dressed in black, between thirty-five and forty years old, had just entered with a woman dressed in oriental costume. The woman was of the greatest beauty, and the costume of such richness that, as we have said, all eyes were instantly turned toward her.
053.116 "Eh!" said Albert, "it is Monte Cristo and his Greek."
053.117 Indeed, it was the Count and Haydée.
053.118 After a moment, the young woman was the object of attention not only of the parterre, but of the whole room; the women leaned out of the boxes to see this cascade of diamonds streaming under the fires of the chandeliers.
053.119 The second act passed in the midst of that dull rumor which indicates in the assembled masses a great event. Nobody thought of shouting silence. This woman, so young, so beautiful, so dazzling, was the most curious spectacle one could see.
053.120 This time, a sign from Mme Danglars clearly indicated to Albert that the baroness wished to have his visit during the next intermission.
053.121 Morcerf was in too good a taste to be kept waiting when it was made clear that he was expected. When the act was over, he hurried to the front of the stage.
053.122 He greeted the two ladies and extended his hand to Debray.
053.123 The baroness greeted him with a charming smile and Eugenie with her usual coldness.
053.124 "My goodness, my dear," said Debray, "you see a man at his wits' end, and he calls you to help him. Here is madame who crushes me with questions about the Count, and who wants me to know where he is from, where he comes from, where he is going; my goodness, I am not Cagliostro, and to get out of my predicament, I said: 'Ask Morcerf all that, he knows his Monte Cristo at the tip of his finger'; then you were signaled.
053.125 -- Is it not incredible, said the baroness, that when one has half a million in secret funds at one's disposal one is not better informed than that?
053.126 --Madam, said Lucien, I beg you to believe that if I had half a million at my disposal, I would use it for something other than taking information on M. de Monte-Cristo, who has no other merit in my eyes than to be twice as rich as a nabob; but I have given the word to my friend Morcerf; make arrangements with him, it is no longer my business.
053.127 -- A mogul would certainly not have sent me a pair of horses worth thirty thousand francs, with four diamonds in their ears, each worth five thousand francs.
053.128 --Oh! diamonds," laughed Morcerf, "that's his mania. I believe that, like Potemkin, he always has them in his pockets, and that he sows them on his path like Little Thumb did with his pebbles.
053.129 -- He will have found some mine, said Madame Danglars; you know that he has unlimited credit on the baron's house?
053.130 -- No, I didn't know that," replied Albert, "but it must be.
053.131 --And that he announced to M. Danglars that he intended to stay a year in Paris and spend six million there?
053.132 --That's the Shah of Persia traveling incognito.
053.133 --And this woman, Monsieur Lucien," said Eugénie, "have you noticed how beautiful she is?
053.134 --In truth, mademoiselle, I only know you to do such good justice to persons of your sex."
053.135 Lucien brought his lorgnon close to her eye.
053.136 "Charming!" he said.
053.137 --And this woman, does M. de Morcerf know who she is?
053.138 --Mademoiselle, said Albert, answering this almost direct question, I know it more or less, as I know everything about the mysterious personage with whom we are dealing. This woman is a Greek.
053.139 --It is easy to see from her costume, and you are only telling me what the whole room already knows, as we do.
053.140 --I am sorry, said Morcerf, to be such an ignorant cicerone, but I must confess that my knowledge is limited to that; I know, moreover, that she is a musician, for one day when I lunched at the Count's house, I heard the sounds of a guzla which could certainly only come from her.
053.141 --So he receives, your count? asked Madame Danglars.
053.142 --And in a splendid manner, I swear to you.
053.143 --I must get Danglars to offer him some dinner, some ball, so that he will return them to us.
053.144 --How can you go to his house? said Debray, laughing.
053.145 --Why not? With my husband!
053.146 --But he is a boy, this mysterious count.
053.147 --You see that he is not, said the baroness, laughing in her turn, pointing to the beautiful Greek woman.
053.148 --This woman is a slave, as he himself told us, do you remember, Morcerf? at your lunch?
053.149 - "Remember, my dear Lucien," said the baroness, "that she looks rather like a princess.
053.150 --From the _Mille et une Nuits_.
053.151 --From the Thousand and One Nights, I don't say; but what makes a princess, my dear?
053.152 --She even has too many, said Eugenie; she would be more beautiful without them, for one would see her neck and her wrists, which are charmingly shaped.
053.153 --Oh! the artist. Here," said Mme. Danglars, "do you see her being passionate?
053.154 --I love everything that is beautiful, said Eugenie.
053.155 --But what do you say about the Count then? said Debray, it seems to me that he is not bad either.
053.156 --The Count? said Eugenie, as if she had not yet thought to look at him, the Count, he is very pale.
053.157 -- "Just so," said Morcerf, "it is in this pallor that the secret we seek lies. The Countess G... claims, as you know, that he is a vampire.
053.158 --So she is back, the Countess G...? asked the Baroness.
053.159 --In that side room, said Eugenie, almost opposite us, my mother; that woman, with that admirable blond hair, is her.
053.160 --Oh, yes, said Mme. Danglars; don't you know what you should do, Morcerf?
053.161 --Order, madame.
053.162 --You should go and visit your Count of Monte Cristo and bring him to us.
053.163 --What for?" said Eugénie.
053.164 --But so that we can talk to him; aren't you curious to see him?
053.165 --Not in the least.
053.166 --Strange child!" murmured the Baroness.
053.167 --Oh!" said Morcerf, "he will probably come by himself. Here, he has seen you, madam, and he greets you."
053.168 The baroness returned the count's greeting, accompanied by a charming smile.
053.169 "Come," said Morcerf, "I sacrifice myself; I leave you and go to see if there is no way to speak to him.
053.170 -Go to his dressing room; it's quite simple.
053.171 --But I have not been introduced.
053.172 -- To whom?
053.173 -- To the beautiful Greek woman.
053.174 --She is a slave, you say?
053.175 --Yes, but you claim she is a princess.... No. I hope that when he sees me come out he will come out.
053.176 -It is possible. Come on!
053.177 --I'm going."
053.178 Morcerf saluted and went out. The Count said a few words in Arabic to Ali, who was standing in the corridor, and took Morcerf's arm.
053.179 Ali closed the door, and stood before it; there was a gathering in the corridor around the Nubian.
053.180 "In truth," said Monte Cristo, "your Paris is a strange city, and your Parisians a singular people. It seems that it is the first time they have seen a Nubian. Look at them crowding around this poor Ali, who doesn't know what it means. I can tell you one thing, for example, that a Parisian can go to Tunis, Constantinople, Baghdad, or Cairo, and no one will surround him.
053.181 -It is that your Orientals are sensible people, and that they only look at what is worth seeing; but believe me, Ali only enjoys this popularity because he belongs to you, and at the moment you are the fashionable man.
053.182 --Really! And who is it that has earned me this favor?
053.183 --By God! yourself. You give carriages of a thousand louis; you save the lives of the wives of the king's prosecutor; you race, under the name of Major Brack, thoroughbred horses and jockeys as big as marmosets; finally, you win golden cups, and you send them to pretty women.
053.184 --And who the hell told you all this nonsense?
053.185 --Dame! the first, Mme. Danglars, who is dying to see you in her dressing room, or rather that you should be seen there; the second, Beauchamp's newspaper, and the third, my own imagination. Why do you call your horse _Vampa_, if you want to keep incognito?
053.186 --Ah, that's true!" said the Count, "that's an imprudence. But tell me, does not the Count de Morcerf sometimes come to the Opera? I have looked for him with my eyes, and I have not seen him anywhere.
053.187 --He will come this evening.
053.188 --Where?
053.189 --In the Baroness' dressing room, I think.
053.190 --That charming person with her is her daughter?
053.191 --Yes.
053.192 --I pay you my compliments."
053.193 Morcerf smiled.
053.194 "We'll talk about that later and in detail," he said. What do you say about music?
053.195 --What music?
053.196 --But the one you just heard.
053.197 -- I say it is very beautiful music for music composed by a human composer, and sung by two-footed birds without feathers, as the late Diogenes said.
053.198 --Ah yes, but, my dear Count, it seems that you could hear the seven choirs of heaven at your whim?
053.199 --But it is a little of that. When I want to hear wonderful music, Viscount, music such as the mortal ear has never heard, I sleep.
053.200 -- Well, but, you are marvelous here; sleep, my dear count, sleep, the Opera was not invented for anything else.
053.201 -- No, in truth, your orchestra makes too much noise. For me to sleep the sleep I speak of, I need peace and quiet, and then some preparation....
053.202 --Ah! the famous hashish?
053.203 -- Right, Viscount, when you want to hear music, come and have dinner with me.
053.204 --But I have already heard some when I went to lunch there, said Morcerf.
053.205 --In Rome?
053.206 --Yes.
053.207 --Ah! it was Haydée's guzla. Yes, the poor exile sometimes amuses herself by playing me tunes from her country."
053.208 Morcerf did not insist further; for his part, the count was silent.
053.209 At this moment the doorbell rang.
053.210 "Will you excuse me?" said the Count as he went back to his dressing room.
053.211 --How so!
053.212 --Expect many things for Countess G... from her vampire.
053.213 --And to the Baroness?
053.214 --Tell her that I will have the honor, if she allows it, of going to pay my respects to her in the evening."
053.215 The third act began. During the third act the Count de Morcerf came, as he had promised, to join Mme Danglars.
053.216 The Count was not one of those men who make a revolution in a room; so no one noticed his arrival but those in whose dressing room he came to take a seat.
053.217 Monte Cristo saw him, however, and a slight smile touched his lips.
053.218 As for Haydée, she saw nothing as long as the canvas was up; like all primitive natures, she adored everything that spoke to the ear and to the sight.
053.219 The third act passed as usual; Misses Noblet, Julia, and Leroux performed their ordinary entrechats; the Prince of Granada was challenged by Robert-Mario; finally that majestic king whom you know went around the room to show his velvet coat, holding his daughter by the hand; then the canvas fell away, and the room immediately disgorged into the foyer and the corridors.
053.220 The Count came out of his dressing room, and a moment later appeared in that of Baroness Danglars.
053.221 The Baroness could not help but utter a cry of surprise slightly mingled with joy.
053.222 "Ah! come, then, Monsieur le Comte!" she cried, for, in truth, I was anxious to add my verbal graces to the written thanks I have already given you.
053.223 -- "Oh, madam," said the Count, "you still remember that misery? I had already forgotten it.
053.224 --Yes, but what is not forgotten, Monsieur le Comte, is that the next day you saved my good friend Mme. de Villefort from the danger that these same horses were running.
053.225 --This time again, madam, I do not deserve your thanks; it was Ali, my Nubian, who had the good fortune to render Mme. de Villefort this eminent service.
053.226 --And was it also Ali, said the Count de Morcerf, who rescued my son from the Roman bandits?
053.227 -- No, Monsieur le Comte," said Monte Cristo, shaking the hand which the general held out to him, "no; this time I take the thanks on my account; but you have already given them to me, I have already received them, and, in truth, I am ashamed to find you still so grateful. So do me the honor, I beg you, Baroness, of introducing me to your daughter, Mademoiselle.
053.228 --Oh, you are all introduced, in name at least, for for two or three days we have been talking of nothing but you. Eugenie," continued the baroness, turning back to her daughter, "Monsieur le Comte de Monte Cristo!"
053.229 The count bowed: Mlle. Danglars made a slight movement of the head.
053.230 "You are here with an admirable person, Monsieur le Comte," said Eugénie; "is this your daughter?
053.231 --No, mademoiselle," said Monte Cristo, astonished at this extreme ingenuity or astonishing aplomb, "she is a poor Greek girl of whom I am the tutor.
053.232 --And who is named?
053.233 --Haydee, replied Monte Cristo.
053.234 --A Greek woman!" murmured the Count of Morcerf.
053.235 --Yes, Count, said Mme. Danglars; and tell me if you ever saw at the court of Ali-Tebelin, whom you served so gloriously, such an admirable costume as that which we have here before our eyes.
053.236 --Ah! said Monte Cristo, you served at Janina, Count?
053.237 -- I was general-inspector of the Pasha's troops, replied Morcerf, and my little fortune, I do not hide it, comes from the generosity of the illustrious Albanian chief.
053.238 --Regard therefore! insisted Madame Danglars.
053.239 --Where?" stammered Morcerf.
053.240 --Here!" said Monte Cristo.
053.241 And, wrapping his arm around the Count, he leaned out of the box with him.
053.242 At this moment Haydée, who was looking for the Count with her eyes, saw his pale head near that of M. de Morcerf, whom he was holding in his arms.
053.243 This sight produced on the young girl the effect of Medusa's head; she made a movement forward as if to devour them both with her gaze, and then, almost immediately, she threw herself back with a faint cry, which was, however, heard by those who were nearest to her and by Ali, who at once opened the door.
053.244 "Well," said Eugenie, "what has happened to your ward, sir? It seems that she is in a bad way.
053.245 -- Indeed, said the Count, but do not be frightened, mademoiselle: Haydée is very nervous and consequently very sensitive to odors: a perfume that is unfriendly to her is enough to make her faint; but, added the Count, drawing a bottle from his pocket, I have the remedy."
053.246 And, after greeting the baroness and her daughter with one and the same salute, he exchanged a last handshake with the count and with Debray, and left Mme. Danglars' dressing room.
053.247 When he entered hers, Haydée was still very pale; hardly had he appeared when she seized his hand. Monte Cristo noticed that the girl's hands were wet and cold at the same time.
053.248 "Who were you talking to, lord?" asked the girl.
053.249 "But," replied Monte Cristo, "with the Count de Morcerf, who was in the service of your illustrious father, and who admits that he owes his fortune to him.
053.250 --Ah, the wretch!" cried Haydée, "it was he who sold him to the Turks; and this fortune is the price of his treason. Did you not know that, my dear lord?
053.251 -- I had already heard some words of this story in Epirus, said Monte Cristo, but I do not know the details. Come, my daughter, you will give them to me, it must be curious.
053.252 --Oh, yes, come, come; it seems to me that I would die if I remained any longer in front of this man."
053.253 And Haydee, rising briskly, wrapped herself in her white cashmere burnous embroidered with pearls and coral, and went out briskly as the cloth rose.
053.254 "See if this man does anything like another!" said the Countess G... to Albert, who had returned to her; "he listens religiously to the third act of _Robert_, and he leaves just as the fourth is about to begin.
054.000 The rise and fall.
054.001 A few days after this meeting, Albert de Morcerf came to visit the Count of Monte Cristo in his house on the Champs-Élysées, which had already taken on the appearance of a palace, which the Count, thanks to his immense fortune, gave to even his most transient habitations.
054.002 He came to renew the thanks of Mrs. Danglars, which a letter signed Baroness Danglars, née Herminie de Servieux, had already brought him.
054.003 Albert was accompanied by Lucien Debray, who added to the words of his friend some compliments which were not official undoubtedly, but of which, thanks to the smoothness of his glance, the count could not suspect the source.
054.004 It even seemed to him that Lucien came to see him, moved by a double feeling of curiosity, and that half of this feeling emanated from the Rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin. Indeed, he could suppose, without fear of being mistaken, that Mme. Danglars, not being able to know by her own eyes the interior of a man who gave away horses worth thirty thousand francs, and who went to the Opera with a Greek slave girl carrying a million diamonds, had charged the eyes through which she was accustomed to see to give him information about that interior.
054.005 But the Count did not seem to suspect the slightest correlation between Lucien's visit and the Baroness's curiosity.
054.006 "You are in almost continuous contact with Baron Danglars?" he asked Albert de Morcerf.
054.007 --But yes, Monsieur le Comte; you know what I told you.
054.008 --So it still holds?
054.009 --More than ever, said Lucien; it is an arranged affair."
054.010 And Lucien, judging undoubtedly that this word mixed with the conversation gave him the right to remain a stranger to it, placed his tortoiseshell lorgnon in his eye, and biting the golden apple of his badine, began to make the tour of the room by examining the weapons and the paintings.
054.011 "Ah!" said Monte-Cristo; "but, listening to you, I had not believed in such a prompt solution.
054.012 --What do you want? Things go on without one suspecting it; while you are not thinking of them, they are thinking of you; and when you turn around you are astonished at the path they have taken. My father and Mr. Danglars served together in Spain, my father in the army, Mr. Danglars in the supplies. It was there that my father, ruined by the Revolution, and Mr. Danglars, who had never had any property, laid the foundations, my father, of his political and military fortune, which is beautiful, Mr. Danglars, of his political and financial fortune, which is admirable.
054.013 --Yes, indeed," said Monte Cristo, "I believe that, during the visit I made to him, M. Danglars spoke to me of this; and," he continued, glancing at Lucien, who was leafing through an album, "and is she pretty, Miss Eugenie? for I seem to remember that it is Eugenie that her name is.
054.014 - "Very pretty, or rather very beautiful," answered Albert, "but of a beauty that I do not appreciate. I am unworthy!
054.015 --You already talk about her as if you were her husband!
054.016 --Oh!" said Albert, looking around to see what Lucien was doing.
054.017 --Do you know, said Monte Cristo, lowering his voice, that you do not seem to me to be enthusiastic about this marriage!
054.018 --Miss Danglars is too rich for me, said Morcerf, that appalls me.
054.019 --Bah!" said Monte Cristo, "that is a good reason; are you not rich yourself?
054.020 - My father has something like fifty thousand pounds of income, and will give me perhaps ten or twelve when I marry.
054.021 -The fact is that it is modest, said the Count, especially in Paris; but not everything is in fortune in this world, and it is something too to have a good name and a high social position. Your name is famous, your position magnificent, and then the Count de Morcerf is a soldier, and one likes to see this integrity of Bayard allied to the poverty of Duguesclin; disinterestedness is the most beautiful ray of sunlight to which a noble sword can shine. I, on the contrary, I find this union most fortunate: Mlle Danglars will enrich you and you will ennoble her!"
054.022 Albert shook his head and remained thoughtful.
054.023 "There is still something else," he said.
054.024 --I confess," said Monte Cristo, "that I find it difficult to understand this repugnance for a rich and beautiful girl.
054.025 --Oh, my God!" said Morcerf, "this repugnance, if there is repugnance, does not come entirely from my side.
054.026 --But on which side, then? for you told me that your father desired this marriage.
054.027 --From my mother's side, and my mother is a prudent and sure eye. Well, she does not smile at this union; she has some prejudice against the Danglars.
054.028 --Oh! said the count with a somewhat forced tone, that is conceivable; Mme. the countess de Morcerf, who is distinction, aristocracy, finesse in person, hesitates a little to touch a commoner's hand, thick and brutal: it is natural.
054.029 --I don't know if that's it, indeed," said Albert; "but what I do know is that it seems to me that this marriage, if it takes place, will make her unhappy. We were supposed to meet to discuss business six weeks ago, but I have been so taken with headaches....
054.030 --Real? said the count smiling.
054.031 --Oh, very real, fear, no doubt, that the appointment has been postponed for two months. I am not yet twenty-one, and Eugenie is only seventeen; but the two months expire next week. It will have to be done. You cannot imagine, my dear Count, how embarrassed I am... Ah! how happy you are to be free!
054.032 --Well, be free too; who's stopping you, I ask you a little?
054.033 --Oh, it would be too great a disappointment for my father if I did not marry Miss Danglars.
054.034 -- Marry her then, said the Count with a singular movement of the shoulders.
054.035 --Yes, said Morcerf; but for my mother it will not be disappointment, but pain.
054.036 --So don't marry her, said the Count.
054.037 --I will see, I will try, you will give me advice, won't you? and, if it is possible, you will get me out of this embarrassment. Oh, not to upset my excellent mother, I would quarrel with the Count, I think."
054.038 Monte Cristo turned away; he seemed moved.
054.039 "Eh!" he said to Debray, who was seated in a deep armchair at the far end of the salon, and who held a pencil in his right hand and a notebook in his left, "what are you doing, a sketch after Poussin?
054.040 --Me? he said quietly, oh, yes, a sketch, I love painting too much for that! No, I do the opposite of painting, I make figures.
054.041 --Numbers?
054.042 -- Yes, I calculate; that concerns you indirectly, viscount; I calculate what the Danglars house has gained on the last rise of Haiti: from two hundred and six the fund has risen to four hundred and nine in three days, and the prudent banker had bought a lot at two hundred and six. He must have gained three hundred thousand pounds.
054.043 --This is not his best move, said Morcerf; did he not earn a million this year with the Spanish bonds?
054.044 --Listen, my dear," said Lucien, "here is M. the Count of Monte Cristo who will tell you what the Italians say:
054.045 _Danaro e santità_ _Metà della metà_[2]
054.046 [Note 2: Money and sanctity, Half of half].
054.047 And this is still a lot. Also, when people tell me such stories, I shrug my shoulders.
054.048 --But you were talking about Haiti? said Monte Cristo.
054.049 --Oh, Haiti is something else; Haiti is the outskirts of the French agiotage. It is possible to love the hot-water bottle, to cherish the whist, to love boston, and yet to be weary of all that; but one always comes back to the spread: it is an appetizer. Thus M. Danglars sold yesterday at four hundred and six and pocketed three hundred thousand francs; if he had waited until today, the fund would have fallen back to two hundred and five, and instead of gaining three hundred thousand francs, he would have lost twenty or twenty-five thousand.
054.050 --And why has the fund fallen from four hundred and nine to two hundred and five? I beg your pardon, I am quite ignorant of all these stock market intrigues.
054.051 --Because," replied Albert, laughing, "the news follows one another and is not the same.
054.052 --Ah, devil," said the Count, "Mr. Danglars is playing to win or lose three hundred thousand francs in one day. But he is enormously rich?
054.053--It is not he who plays!" cried Lucien, "it is Mrs. Danglars; she is truly intrepid.
054.054 --But you, who are reasonable, Lucien, and who know how unstable the news is, since you are at the source, you should prevent it, said Morcerf with a smile.
054.055 --How could I, if her husband does not succeed? You know the character of the baroness; no one has any influence over her, and she does absolutely nothing but what she wants.
054.056 --Oh! if I were in your place! said Albert.
054.057 -- Well!
054.058 -- I would cure her; it would be a service to render to her future son-in-law.
054.059 --How is that?
054.060 --Ah, by God! It's very easy, I'd give her a lesson.
054.061 --A lesson?
054.062 --Yes. Your position as secretary to the minister gives you great authority for news; you don't open your mouth until the stockbrokers take down your words as quickly as possible; make her lose a hundred thousand francs one after the other, and that will make her careful.
054.063 --I don't understand," stammered Lucien.
054. 064 --It is, however, clear, replied the young man with a naivety that had nothing of affectation; announce to her one fine morning something unheard of, some telegraphic news that only you can know; that Henri IV, for example, was seen yesterday at Gabrielle's house; that will make the funds go up, she will establish her stock market coup on that, and she will certainly lose when Beauchamp writes the next day in his newspaper: "It is wrong that well-informed people claim that King Henri IV was seen the day before yesterday at Gabrielle's, this fact is completely inaccurate; King Henri IV did not leave the Pont Neuf. "
054.065 Lucien began to laugh with his lips. Monte-Cristo, although indifferent in appearance, had not lost a word of this interview, and his piercing eye had even believed to read a secret in the embarrassment of the intimate secretary.
054.066 It resulted from this embarrassment of Lucien, which had completely escaped Albert, that Lucien abbreviated his visit.
054.067 He obviously felt uneasy. The Count said a few words to him in a low voice as he led him away, to which he replied:
054.068 "With pleasure, sir count, I accept."
054.069 The Count returned to the young de Morcerf.
054.070 "Don't you think, on reflection," he said to him, "that you were wrong to speak as you did of your mother-in-law in front of M. Debray?
054.071 -- "Here, Count," said Morcerf, "I beg you, do not say that word in advance.
054.072 -- Really, and without exaggeration, the Countess is so opposed to this marriage?
054.073 --So much so that the Baroness rarely comes to the house, and that my mother, I believe, has not been twice in her life to Madame Danglars'.
054.074 -- So, said the count, I am emboldened to speak to you with an open heart: M. Danglars is my banker, M. de Villefort has showered me with politeness in gratitude for a service which a happy chance has enabled me to render him. I can guess underneath all this an avalanche of dinners and parties. Now, in order not to appear to be lavishly embroidering the whole thing, and even to have the merit of taking the lead, if you like, I have planned to bring together in my country house at Auteuil Mr. and Mrs. Danglars, Mr. and Mrs. de Villefort. If I invite you to this dinner, as well as M. le Comte and Mme de Morcerf, will it not look like a sort of matrimonial rendezvous, or at least Mme de Morcerf will not consider it as such, especially if M. le Baron Danglars does me the honor of bringing his daughter? Then your mother will dislike me, and I don't want any of that; on the contrary, I want, and tell her so whenever the occasion arises, to remain in her mind as well as possible.
054.075 - "My goodness, Count," said Morcerf, "I thank you for being so frank with me, and I accept the exclusion you propose. You say that you want to remain as well as possible in the spirit of my mother, where you are already wonderfully.
054.076 --You think so?" said Monte Cristo with interest.
054.077 --Oh, I am sure of it. When you left us the other day, we talked about you for an hour, but I come back to what we were saying. Well, if my mother could know of this attention on your part, and I venture to tell her, I am sure she would be most grateful. It is true that on his side my father would be furious."
054.078 The Count laughed.
054.079 "Well," he said to Morcerf, "you have been warned. But I think, it will not be only your father who will be furious; Mr. and Mrs. Danglars will consider me a very bad man. They know that I see you with a certain intimacy, that you are even my oldest Parisian acquaintance, and they will not find you at my place; they will ask me why I did not invite you. Think at least of having a previous engagement that has some appearance of probability, and of which you will inform me by means of a small note. You know that with bankers, only the written word is valid.
054.080 --I will do better than that, sir count," said Albert. My mother wants to go and breathe the sea air. On what day is your dinner fixed?
054.081 -- On Saturday.
054.082 -- It is Tuesday, all right; tomorrow evening we leave; the day after tomorrow we will be at Le Tréport. Do you know, sir count, that you are a charming man to put people at their ease!
054.083 --Me! in truth you take me for more than I am worth; I wish to be pleasant to you, that is all.
054.084 --What day did you make your invitations?
054.085 --Today itself.
054.086 --Good! I run to Mr. Danglars, I tell him that we are leaving Paris tomorrow, my mother and me. I have not seen you; therefore I know nothing about your dinner.
054.087 --Crazy as you are! And Mr. Debray, who has just seen you at my house!
054.088 --Ah, that's right.
054.089 --On the contrary, I saw you and invited you here without ceremony, and you quite naively answered me that you could not be my guest, because you were leaving for Le Tréport.
054.090 -- Well, that's settled. But will you come to see my mother before tomorrow?
054.091 --The day before tomorrow is difficult; then I would be in the middle of your preparations for departure.
054.092 --Well, do better than that; you were only a charming man, you will be an adorable man.
054.093 --What must I do to reach this sublimity?
054.094 -What do you have to do?
054.095 -- I ask.
054.096 -- Today you are as free as a bird; come and dine with me: we will be in a small committee, you, my mother and me only. You have hardly seen my mother; but you will see her up close. She is a very remarkable woman, and I only regret one thing: that her equal does not exist with twenty years less; there would soon be, I swear to you, a countess and a viscountess of Morcerf. As for my father, you won't find him: he's on commission tonight and is dining at the grand referendary. Come, we'll talk about travel. You who have seen the whole world, you will tell us about your adventures; you will tell us the story of that beautiful Greek woman who was with you the other night at the Opera, whom you call your slave and whom you treat like a princess. We will speak Italian, Spanish. Let's see, accept; my mother will thank you.
054.097 --A thousand graces, said the count; the invitation is most gracious, and I deeply regret not being able to accept it. I am not free as you thought, and on the contrary I have a most important appointment.
054.098 --Ah, beware; you taught me just now how, in the matter of dinner, one discharges oneself of an unpleasant thing. I need proof. I am fortunately not a banker like Mr. Danglars; but I am, I warn you, as incredulous as he is.
054.099 --And so I will give it to you," said the Count.
054.100 And he rang the bell.
054.101 "Hm!" said Morcerf, "you have already refused to dine with my mother twice. It is a prejudice, Count."
054.102 Monte Cristo shuddered.
054.103 "Oh, you don't believe it," he said; "besides, here is my proof that is coming."
054.104 Baptistin entered and stood in the doorway waiting.
054.105 "I wasn't told you were coming, was I?
054.106 --Lady! You are such an extraordinary man that I would not answer for it.
054.107 --I could not guess that you would invite me to dinner, at least.
054.108 -- Oh, as for that, it is probable.
054.109 -- Well, listen, Baptistin... what did I tell you this morning when I called you into my study?
054.110 -- To have the Count's door closed when the clock struck five.
054.111 --Then?
054.112 --Oh! Sir Count... said Albert.
054.113 -- No, no, I absolutely want to get rid of this mysterious reputation that you have made for me, my dear viscount. It is too difficult to play Manfred forever. I want to live in a glass house. Next.... Continue, Baptistin.
054.114 --Next, to receive only Mr. Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and his son.
054.115 --You hear, Mr. Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, a man of the oldest nobility in Italy and whose d'Hozier Dante took the trouble to be.... You either remember or you don't, in the tenth canto of the Inferno; moreover, his son, a charming young man of about your age, a viscount, bearing the same title as you, and who is making his entry into the Parisian world with his father's millions. The major brings me this evening his son Andrea, the contino, as we say in Italy. He entrusts him to me. I will push him if he has some merit. You will help me, won't you?
054.116 --Surely! So this Major Cavalcanti is an old friend of yours?
054.117 -Not at all, he is a worthy gentleman, very polite, very modest, very discreet, like there are many in Italy, very descended from old families. I saw him several times, either in Florence, Bologna or Lucca, and he warned me of his arrival. Traveling acquaintances are demanding: they demand from you, in every place, the friendship that you once showed them by chance; as if the civilized man, who knows how to live an hour with anyone, did not always have his ulterior motive! This good Major Cavalcanti is going to see Paris again, which he saw only in passing, under the Empire, on his way to Moscow to be frozen. I will give him a good dinner, he will leave his son with me; I will promise to look after him; I will let him do all the foolish things he wants to do, and we will be even.
054.118 -- Wonderful! said Albert, and I see that you are a valuable mentor. Farewell then, we shall be back on Sunday. By the way, I have received news from Franz.
054.119 --Ah, really!" said Monte Cristo; "and is he still enjoying himself in Italy?
054.120 -- I think so; however, he misses you there. He says that you were the sun of Rome, and that without you it is gray there. I don't even know if he doesn't go so far as to say that it rains there.
054.121 -- So your friend Franz is back on my account?
054.122 -On the contrary, he still thinks you are fantastic in the first place; that is why he misses you.
054.123 --Charming young man! said Monte Cristo, and for whom I felt a lively sympathy the first evening I saw him looking for a supper of some sort, and he was willing to accept mine. He is, I believe, the son of General d'Epinay?
054.124 -- Just so.
054.125 -The same one who was so miserably murdered in 1815?
054.126 --By the Bonapartists.
054.127 --That's it! My goodness, I love him! Aren't there plans for him to get married, too?
054.128 --Yes, he must marry Mlle de Villefort.
054.129 -Is that true?
054.130 --As I must marry Miss Danglars," said Albert, laughing.
054.131 --You laugh....
054.132 --Yes.
054.133 --Why are you laughing?
054.134 --I am laughing because it seems to me that there is as much sympathy for the marriage on this side as there is on the other side between Miss Danglars and myself. But really, my dear count, we talk about women as women talk about men; it is unforgivable!"
054.135 Albert rose to his feet.
054.136 "Are you leaving?
054.137 --That's a good question! I've been knocking you out for two hours, and you have the courtesy to ask me if I'm leaving! In truth, Count, you are the most polite man on earth! And your servants, how well trained they are! Mr. Baptistin especially! I could never have one like that. My servants all seem to take their cue from those at the Théâtre-Français, who, precisely because they have only one word to say, always come and say it on the stage. Thus, if you get rid of Mr. Baptistin, I ask you for preference.
054.138 -It's said, Viscount.
054.139 -That's not all, wait: give my compliments to your discreet Lucquois, to the lord Cavalcante dei Cavalcanti; and if by chance he wanted to establish his son, find him a woman who is very rich, very noble, at least on his mother's side, and a baroness on his father's. I will help you.
054.140 --Oh! oh! replied Monte Cristo, in truth, you are there?
054.141 -- Yes.
054.142 --My goodness, one must not swear to anything.
054.143 --Ah, Count, cried Morcerf, what a service you would do me, and how I would love you a hundred times more if, thanks to you, I remained a boy, even if only for ten years.
054.144 - "Everything is possible," replied Monte Cristo gravely.
054.145 And taking leave of Albert, he went home and struck his bell three times.
054.146 Bertuccio appeared.
054.147 "Mr. Bertuccio," he said, "you'll know that I'm having a party on Saturday at my house in Auteuil."
054.148 Bertuccio shivered slightly.
054.149 "Good, sir," he said.
054.150 --I need you," continued the Count, "to have everything properly prepared. This house is very beautiful, or at least can be very beautiful.
054.151 -- It would be necessary to change everything to get there, Mr. Count, because the hangings are old.
054.152 --Change everything, then, except for one, the one in the red damask bedroom: you will even leave it absolutely as it is."
054.153 Bertuccio bowed.
054.154 "You will not touch the garden either; but of the courtyard, for example, do with it whatever you like; it will even be pleasant for me if it cannot be recognized.
054.155 --I will do my utmost to make his Lordship happy; I would be more reassured, however, if his Lordship would tell me his intentions for dinner.
054.156 --In truth, my dear Mr. Bertuccio," said the Count, "since you have been in Paris I find you out of place, trembling; but don't you know me anymore?
054.157 --But at last His Excellency could tell me who he is receiving!
054.158 --I don't know yet, and you don't need to know either. Lucullus is dining at Lucullus', that's all."
054.159 Bertuccio bowed and left.
055.000 Major Cavalcanti.
055.001 Neither the Count nor Baptistin had lied in announcing to Morcerf this visit of the Lucullus major, which served as a pretext for Monte Cristo to refuse the dinner offered to him.
055.002 Seven o'clock had just struck, and M. Bertuccio, according to the order he had received, had left two hours ago for Auteuil, when a carriage stopped at the door of the hotel, and seemed to flee all ashamed as soon as it had deposited near the gate a man of about fifty-two years of age, dressed in one of those green frock coats with black suspenders, the kind of which is imperishable, it seems, in Europe. A large pair of pants of blue cloth, a boot still rather clean, although of an uncertain varnish and a little too thick of sole, gloves of suede, a hat approaching for the shape of a gendarme's hat, a black collar, embroidered with a white border, which, if its owner had not worn it of his full and whole will, could have passed for a straitjacket: such was the picturesque costume under which the character presented himself who rang the bell at the gate and asked if it was not at number 30 of the Avenue des Champs-Élysées that M. the Count of Monte Cristo, and who, on the affirmative answer of the concierge, entered, closed the door behind him and went towards the perron.
055.003 The small and angular head of this man, his whitening hair, his thick and gray mustache made him recognized by Baptistin, who had the exact description of the visitor and who awaited him at the bottom of the hall. So, as soon as he had pronounced his name to the intelligent servant, Monte Cristo was warned of his arrival.
055.004 The stranger was ushered into the simplest of rooms. The Count was waiting for him there and went to meet him with a laughing air.
055.005 "Ah, dear sir," he said, "welcome. I was expecting you.
055.006 --Really," said the Luccan, "Your Excellency was expecting me.
055.007 --Yes, I had been warned of your arrival for today at seven o'clock.
055.008 --About my arrival? So you were warned?
055.009 --Perfectly.
055.010 --Ah, so much the better! I was afraid, I must admit, that this little precaution had been forgotten.
055.011 -What is it?
055.012 --To warn you.
055.013 --Oh, not!
055.014 --But are you sure you're not mistaken?
055.015 -- I'm sure.
055.016 -Is it really me that Your Excellency was expecting today at seven o'clock?
055.017 -It is you. In fact, let's check.
055.018 --Oh, if you were waiting for me," said the Lucan, "there's no need.
055.019 --So done! So done!" said Monte Cristo.
055.020 The Lucan appeared slightly worried.
055.021 "Let's see," said Monte Cristo, "aren't you Mr. Marquis Bartolomeo Cavalcanti?
055.022 --Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, repeated the joyful Lucca man, that's right.
055.023 --Ex-major in the service of Austria?
055.024 -- Was I a major? asked the old soldier timidly.
055.025 -- Yes, said Monte Cristo, it was major. It is the name given in France to the rank you held in Italy.
055.026 --Well, says the Lucquois, I do not ask for more, me, you understand ....
055.027 - Besides, you do not come here of your own accord, resumed Monte Cristo.
055.028 --Oh, certainly.
055.029 -- You are addressed to me by someone.
055.030 -- Yes.
055.031 --By that excellent Abbot Busoni?
055.032 --That's right!" exclaimed the joyful Major.
055.033 --And you have a letter?
055.034 -Here it is.
055.035 -- "Oh, my goodness, you see. Give it to me."
055.036 And Monte Cristo took the letter which he opened and read.
055.037 The major looked at the count with large, astonished eyes that went curiously over every part of the apartment, but which invariably returned to its owner.
055.038 "It is well that... this dear abbot, "Major Cavalcanti, a worthy practitioner of Lucca, descendant of the Cavalcanti of Florence," continued Monte Cristo as he read, "enjoying a fortune of half a million in revenue."
055.039 Monte Cristo looked up from the paper and saluted.
055.040 "Of half a million," he said; "pest! my dear Mr. Cavalcanti.
055.041 --Is there half a million?" asked the Lucan.
055.042 -- In all letters; and it must be, the Abbot Busoni is the man who knows best all the great fortunes of Europe.
055.043 -- Goes for half a million, said the Luccan; but, my word of honor, I did not believe that it went up so high.
055.044 --Because you have a steward who steals from you; what do you want, dear Mr. Cavalcanti, it is necessary to pass by there!
055.045 -- "You have just enlightened me," said the Lucquois gravely, "I will put the strange man at the door.
055.046 Monte Cristo continued:
055.047 -- "And to whom only one thing is missing to be happy."
055.048 --Oh, my God, yes! only one thing, said the Lucan with a sigh.
055.049 -- "To find a beloved son."
055.050 -- A beloved son!
055.051 -- "Taken away in his youth, either by an enemy of his noble family, or by Bohemians."
055.052 --At the age of five, sir, said the Lucca man with a deep sigh and looking up to heaven.
055.053 - "Poor father!" said Monte Cristo.
055.054 The Count continued:
055.055 -- "I give him back hope, I give him back his life, sir count, by announcing to him that this son, whom for fifteen years he has been searching in vain, you can make him find him."
055.056 The Lucan looked at Monte Cristo with an indefinable expression of concern.
055.057 "I can," replied Monte Cristo.
055.058 The major straightened up.
055.059 "Ah! ah!" he said, "was the letter true to the end?
055.060 --Did you doubt it, dear Mr. Bartolomeo?
055.061 -- No, never! A serious man, a man with a religious character like Father Busoni, would not have allowed himself such a joke; but you have not read everything, Excellency.
055.062 --Ah, it is true, said Monte Cristo, there is a postscript.
055.063 --Yes, repeated the Lucan... there... has... a... _post-scriptum_.
055.064 -- "In order not to cause Major Cavalcanti the embarrassment of moving funds to his banker, I am sending him a draft of two thousand francs for his travel expenses, and the credit on you of the sum of forty-eight thousand francs which you remain to me."
055.065 The major followed this _post-scriptum_ with his eyes with visible anxiety.
055.066 "Good!" said the count contentedly.
055.067 -- "He said good," murmured the Luccan. So... sir... he continued.
055.068 - "So?" asked Monte Cristo.
055.069 --And so, the _post-scriptum_...
055.070 --Well, the _post-scriptum_?
055.071 --Is it received by you as favorably as the rest of the letter?
055.072 --Certainly. I don't know if it's precisely forty-eight thousand pounds that I'm going to give back to him; we're not talking about a few bank bills. Oh, did you attach so much importance to this postscript, dear Mr. Cavalcanti?
055.073 -- I will confess to you," replied the Lucan, "that full of confidence in the signature of the Abbot Busoni, I had not provided myself with other funds; so that if I had lacked this resource, I would have found myself in great difficulty in Paris.
055.074 -- Is a man like you embarrassed anywhere?
055.075 --Dame! not knowing anyone, said the Lucan.
055.076 --But we know you.
055.077 --Yes, they know me, so that ....
055.078 --Come on, dear Mr. Cavalcanti!
055.079 --So you will give me these forty-eight thousand pounds?
055.080 --At your first requisition."
055.081 The major rolled his big eyes in amazement.
055.082 "But sit down," said Monte Cristo: "in truth, I don't know what I'm doing... I've been holding you up for a quarter of an hour.
055.083 --Don't pay any attention."
055.084 The major drew a chair and sat down.
055.085 "Now," said the Count, "would you like something; a glass of sherry, port, alicante?
055.086 --Alicante, since you want it, it is my favorite wine.
055.087 -- I have some excellent ones. With a cookie, right?
055.088 --With a cookie, since you're forcing me to."
055.089 Monte Cristo rang; Baptistin appeared.
055.090 The Count advanced toward him.
055.091 "Well?" he asked softly.
055.092 --The young man is here," replied the valet in the same tone.
055.093 -Well, where did you bring him in?
055.094 --In the blue room, as His Excellency had ordered.
055.095 -- Wonderful. Bring some Alicante wine and cookies."
055.096 Baptistin went out.
055.097 "In truth," said the Lucchese, "I am giving you a pain that fills me with confusion.
055.098 "Let's go then!" said Monte Cristo.
055.099 Baptistin returned with the glasses, the wine and the cookies.
055.100 The Count filled one glass and poured into the second only a few drops of the liquid ruby that the bottle contained, all covered with cobwebs and all the other signs that indicate the age of wine much more surely than wrinkles do for a man.
055.101 The major did not make a mistake in the sharing, he took the full glass and a cookie. The Count ordered Baptistin to put the tray within reach of his host, who began by tasting the alicante with his lips, made a grimace of satisfaction, and delicately introduced the cookie into the glass.
055.102 "So, sir," said Monte Cristo, "you lived in Lucca, you were rich, you are noble, you enjoyed general consideration, you had everything that can make a man happy.
055.103 -Everything, Excellency," said the Major, gulping down his cookie, "everything absolutely.
055.104 -- And there was only one thing missing from your happiness?
055.105 -- Only one thing, said the Lucan.
055.106 -- Was it to find your child?
055.107 --Ah!" said the major, taking a second cookie; "but I also missed that.
055.108 The worthy Lucca man looked up and tried an effort to sigh.
055.109 "Now, let's see, dear Mr. Cavalcanti," said Monte Cristo, "what was this much missed son? for I had been told that you had remained single.
055.110 --We thought so, sir, said the major, and I myself....
055.111 -- Yes," said Monte Cristo, "and you yourself had given credence to this rumor. A sin of youth that you wanted to hide from all eyes."
055.112 The Lucquois straightened up, assumed his calmest and most dignified air, at the same time as he modestly lowered his eyes, either to ensure his composure or to help his imagination, while looking underneath at the Count, whose stereotyped smile on his lips announced the same benevolent curiosity as always.
055.113 "Yes, sir," he said, "I wanted to hide this fault from all eyes."
055.114 --Not for you, said Monte Cristo, for a man is above such things.
055.115 --Oh, no, not for me certainly, said the major with a smile and shaking his head.
055.116 --But for his mother, said the Count.
055.117 --For his mother!" cried the Lucca man, taking a third cookie, "for his poor mother!
055.118 - "Drink, then, dear Mr. Cavalcanti," said Monte Cristo, pouring the Lucca man a second glass of alicante; the emotion is choking you.
055.119 --For his poor mother! murmured the Lucca man, trying to see if the power of the will could not, by acting on the lacrimal gland, wet the corner of his eye with a false tear.
055.120 --Who belonged to one of the first families of Italy, I believe?
055.121 --Patrician of Fiesole, sir count, patrician of Fiesole!
055.122 --And what was her name?
055.123 --Do you want to know her name?
055.124 --Oh, my God!" said Monte Cristo, "it is useless for you to tell me, I know it.
055.125 --Monsieur le Comte knows everything, said the Lucquois, bowing.
055.126 --Olivia Corsinari, right?
055.127 --Olivia Corsinari.
055.128 --Marquise?
055.129 --Marchioness.
055.130 --And you ended up marrying her, however, despite the opposition of the family?
055.131 --My God! yes, I ended up that way.
055.132 -- And, continued Monte Cristo, you bring your papers in order?
055.133 -- What papers?" asked the Lucan.
055.134 --But your marriage certificate with Olivia Corsinari, and the birth certificate of the child.
055.135 -The child's birth certificate?
055.136 --The birth certificate of Andrea Cavalcanti, of your son; isn't his name Andrea?
055.137 -- I think so, said the Lucan.
055.138 --How! do you believe it?
055.139 --Lady! I don't dare to say, it's been so long since he was lost.
055.140 - That's right, said Monte Cristo. Finally you have all these papers?
055.141 --Mr. Count, it is with regret that I announce to you that, not having been warned to provide myself with these pieces, I neglected to take them with me.
055.142 --Ah! devil, said Monte Cristo.
055.143 -- Were they really necessary?
055.144 --Indispensable!"
055.145 Lucquois scratched his forehead.
055.146 "Ah! _per Bacco_!" he said, "indispensable!
055.147 --Without doubt; if anyone were to raise any doubt here about the validity of your marriage, about the legitimacy of your child!
055.148 --That's right, said the Luccan, one could raise doubts.
055.149 --That would be unfortunate for this young man.
055.150 -It would be fatal.
055.151 --That could make him miss some magnificent wedding.
055.152 --_O peccato_!
055.153 --In France, you understand, we are severe; it is not enough, as in Italy, to go to a priest and say to him: "We love each other, unite us." There is a civil marriage in France, and, to marry civilly, one needs documents that establish identity.
055.154 --That's the trouble: I don't have these papers.
055.155 -- "Fortunately I have them," said Monte Cristo.
055.156 --You?
055.157 -- Yes?
055.158 -- Do you have them?
055.159 -- I have them.
055.160 --Ah! for example, said the Lucan, who, seeing the purpose of his journey missed by the absence of his papers, feared that this oversight would lead to some difficulty about the forty-eight thousand pounds; ah! for example, here is a happiness! Yes," he continued, "that is a blessing, for I would not have thought of it.
055.161 -God! I think so, one does not think of everything. But fortunately Abbot Busoni thought of it for you.
055.162 -- You see, that dear abbot!
055.163 -He is a man of precaution.
055.164 --Admirable man, said the Lucca man; and he sent them to you?
055.165 -Here they are."
055.166 The Lucca man clasped his hands together in admiration.
055.167 "You married Olivia Corsinari in the church of Saint Paul of Monte Catini; here is the priest's certificate.
055.168 --Yes, my goodness! Here it is," said the Major, looking at him with astonishment.
055.169 --And here is the baptismal certificate of Andrea Cavalcanti, issued by the priest of Saravezza.
055.170 --Everything is in order, said the Major.
055.171 --Then take these papers, of which I have no use, you will give them to your son who will keep them carefully.
055.172 -- I believe it well!... If he should lose them....
055.173 --Well, if he lost them?" asked Monte Cristo.
055.174 --Well," said the Lucan, "we would be obliged to write there, and it would take a long time to get others.
055.175 -- Indeed, it would be difficult, said Monte Cristo.
055.176 -- Almost impossible, replied the Lucan.
055.177 -- I am well at ease that you understand the value of these papers.
055.178 -- That is to say, I consider them unpayable.
055.179 -- Now, said Monte Cristo, as for the young man's mother...
055.180 -- As for the young man's mother... repeated the Major with concern.
055.181 --What about the Marquise Corsinari?
055.182 --My God! said the Lucca man, under whose footsteps the difficulties seemed to arise, would she be needed?
055.183 -- "No, sir," said Monte Cristo; "besides, has she no...?
055.184 --So done, so done, said the major, she has....
055.185 --Paid her tribute to nature?
055.186 -- Alas! yes, said the Lucca man briskly.
055.187 --I knew that, said Monte Cristo; she died ten years ago.
055.188 --And I still mourn her death, sir," said the major, drawing a checkered handkerchief from his pocket and wiping alternately first his left eye and then his right.
055.189 --What do you want, said Monte Cristo, we are all mortal. Now you understand, dear Monsieur Cavalcanti, you understand that it is useless for anyone to know in France that you have been separated from your son for fifteen years. All these stories of gypsies kidnapping children are not in vogue here. You sent him to a provincial school to get an education, and you want him to complete his education in the Parisian world. That's why you left Via-Reggio, which you had been living in since your wife died. That will be enough.
055.190 -- You think so?
055.191 --Certainly.
055.192 --Very well, then.
055.193 --If we learn anything from this separation ....
055.194 --Ah, yes. What would I say?
055.195 --That an unfaithful tutor, sold to the enemies of your family....
055.196 --To the Corsinari?
055.197 --Certainly... had taken this child so that your name would be extinguished.
055.198 --That's right, since he is an only child.
055.199 --Well, now that everything has stopped, now that your memories have been restored and will not betray you, you have no doubt guessed that I have provided you with a surprise?
055.200 --Agreable? asked the Lucan.
055.201 --Ah! said Monte Cristo, I see that one does not deceive the eye more than the heart of a father.
055.202 --Hum! said the major.
055.203 -- Someone has made some indiscreet revelation to you, or rather you have guessed that he was there.
055.204 --Who, there?
055.205 -- Your child, your son, your Andrea.
055.206 -- I guessed it, answered the Lucan with the greatest phlegm in the world: so he is here?
055.207 -- Right here, said Monte Cristo; when I came in just now, the valet warned me of his arrival.
055.208 --Ah! very good! ah! very good! said the major, tightening the straps of his polonaise at each exclamation.
055.209 --My dear sir, said Monte-Cristo, I understand all your emotion, you must be given time to recover; I also want to prepare the young man for this much desired interview, for I presume he is no less impatient than you.
055.210 -- I believe so, said Cavalcanti.
055.211 -- Well, in a little quarter of an hour we are yours.
055.212 -- So you are bringing him to me? So you are going so far as to present him to me yourself?
055.213 -- No, I don't want to come between a father and his son; you will be alone, sir; but rest assured, even if the voice of blood were to remain silent, there is no mistaking it: he will enter through this door. He is a handsome blond young man, a little too blond perhaps, with a very considerate manner; you will see.
055.214 -- By the way," said the major, "you know that I only took with me the two thousand francs that the good Abbé Busoni had given me. On this I made the trip, and ....
055.215 --And you need money... that's too much, dear Mr. Cavalcanti. Here, to make an account, are eight thousand-franc bills."
055.216 The major's eyes shone like carbuncles.
055.217 "It is forty thousand francs that I give you back," said Monte Cristo.
055.218 --Does Your Excellency want a receipt?" said the Major, slipping the bills into the inside pocket of his polonaise.
055.219 --What for? said the count.
055.220 --But to discharge you from the responsibility of Abbé Busoni.
055.221 -- Well, you will give me a general receipt when you touch the last forty thousand francs. Between honest people, such precautions are useless.
055.222 --Ah, yes, that's true, said the major, between honest people.
055.223 --Now, one last word, Marquis.
055.224 --Say.
055.225 -- You'll allow a little recommendation, won't you?
055.226 --How so! I'm asking for it.
055.227 --It wouldn't hurt for you to leave that Polish girl.
055.228 --Really! said the major, looking at the garment with a certain complacency.
055.229 --Yes, it is still worn in Via-Reggio, but in Paris it is already a long time since this costume, however elegant it may be, has gone out of fashion.
055.230 --That's unfortunate, said the Lucan.
055.231 --Oh! if you like it, you can take it back when you leave.
055.232 --But what will I wear?
055.233 --What you find in your trunks.
055.234 --How, in my trunks! I have only one coat rack.
055.235 --With you, no doubt. Why bother? Besides, an old soldier likes to walk in a smart outfit.
055.236 --That's exactly why ....
055.237 -- But you are a man of precaution, and you sent your trunks ahead. They arrived yesterday at the Hotel des Princes, rue Richelieu. That's where you kept your lodging.
055.238 -- So in these trunks?
055.239 -- I presume that you had the precaution of having your valet lock up everything you need: city clothes, uniforms. In the great circumstances, you will put on the uniform, it looks good. Don't forget your cross. They still don't care about it in France, but they always wear it.
055.240 --Very good, very good, very good! said the major who walked from dazzle to dazzle.
055.241 --And now, said Monte-Cristo, that your heart is firmed against too lively emotions, prepare yourself, dear Monsieur Cavalcanti, to see your son Andrea again."
055.242 And making a charming greeting to the Lucquois, delighted, in ecstasy, Monte-Cristo disappeared behind the tapestry.
056.000 Andrea Cavalcanti.
056.001 The Count of Monte Cristo entered the neighboring salon, which Baptistin had designated as the blue salon, and where a young man with an unobtrusive appearance, rather elegantly dressed, had just preceded him, and whom a cabriolet had, half an hour before, thrown at the door of the hotel. Baptistin had no difficulty in recognizing him; it was indeed this tall young man with blond hair, a red beard, and black eyes, whose ruddy complexion and dazzlingly white skin had been pointed out to him by his master.
056.002 When the Count entered the salon, the young man was lying carelessly on a sofa, absent-mindedly whipping his boot with a small gold-headed rush.
056.003 When he saw Monte Cristo, he stood up quickly.
056.004 "Monsieur is the Count of Monte Cristo?
056.005 --Yes, sir," replied the latter, "and I have the honor of speaking, I believe, to Monsieur le Vicomte Andrea Cavalcanti?
056.006 --The viscount Andrea Cavalcanti, repeated the young man by accompanying these words of a greeting full of casualness.
056.007 --You must have a letter which accredits you to me? said Monte Cristo.
056.008 --I did not tell you about it because of the signature, which seemed strange to me.
056.009 --Simbad the sailor, isn't it?
056.010 -- Right. Now, as I have never known any other Simbad the sailor than the one in the _Thousand and One Nights_....
056.011 --Well, it is one of his descendants, a very rich friend of mine, an Englishman more than original, almost mad, whose real name is Lord Wilmore.
056.012 --Ah, that explains it all to me, says Andrea. Then it goes wonderfully. It is this same Englishman that I knew... in... yes, very well! Mister Count, I am your servant.
056.013 --If what you do me the honor of telling me is true," replied the Count, smiling, "I hope you will be good enough to give me some details about yourself and your family.
056.014 --Willingly, sir count, replied the young man with a volubility which proved the solidity of his memory. I am, as you said, the viscount Andrea Cavalcanti, son of the major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, descendant of the Cavalcanti inscribed in the golden book of Florence. Our family, although still very rich, since my father has half a million in income, has suffered many misfortunes, and I myself, sir, was kidnapped at the age of five or six by an unfaithful governor, so that for fifteen years I have not seen the author of my days. Since I have reached the age of reason, since I am free and master of myself, I have been looking for him, but in vain. Finally this letter from your friend Simbad tells me that he is in Paris, and authorizes me to turn to you for news of him.
056.015 --In truth, sir, all that you tell me here is very interesting," said the Count, looking with dark satisfaction at this uncluttered face, imbued with a beauty like that of the evil angel, "and you have done very well to comply in all things with the invitation of my friend Simbad, for your father is indeed here and is seeking you."
056.016 The Count, since entering the drawing-room, had not lost sight of the young man, he had admired the assurance of his look and the sureness of his voice; but at these words, so natural: _Your father is indeed here and looking for you_, young Andrea leaped up and cried out:
056.017 "My father! my father here?
056.018 --Surely," replied Monte Cristo, "your father, Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti."
056.019 The impression of terror spread over the young man's features faded almost at once.
056.020 "Ah, yes, it is true," he said, "Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti. And you say, sir count, that he is here, that dear father.
056.021 -- Yes, sir. I will even add that I am leaving him now, that the story he told me of this dear son, lost in the past, has touched me greatly; in truth, his pains, his fears, his hopes on this subject would compose a touching poem. Finally, one day he received news that the kidnappers of his son offered to return him, or to indicate where he was, in return for a rather large sum of money. But nothing held back this good father; this sum was sent to the border of Piedmont, with a passport all stamped for Italy. You were in the South of France, I believe?
056.022 --Yes, sir," replied Andrea with a rather embarrassed air; "yes, I was in the South of France.
056.023 --A car was to wait for you in Nice?
056.024 --That's right, sir; it took me from Nice to Genoa, from Genoa to Turin, from Turin to Chambéry, from Chambéry to Pont-de-Beauvoisin, and from Pont-de-Beauvoisin to Paris.
056.025 -- Wonderful! He always hoped to meet you on the way, for that was the route he himself followed; that's why your itinerary had been mapped out this way.
056.026 --But, said Andrea, if he had met me, this dear father, I doubt he would have recognized me; I am somewhat changed since I lost sight of him.
056.027 -- "Oh, the voice of blood," said Monte Cristo.
056.028 --Ah, yes, it is true," said the young man, "I had not thought of the voice of blood.
056. 029 - Now, Monte Cristo continued, there is only one thing that worries the Marquis Cavalcanti, and that is what you have done while you have been away from him; it is how you have been treated by your persecutors; it is whether all the respect due to your birth has been maintained; it is finally if it did not remain you of this moral suffering to which you were exposed, suffering worse a hundred times than the physical suffering, some weakening of the faculties with which nature so largely endowed you, and if you believe yourself to be able to take again and to support worthily in the world the rank which belongs to you.
056.030 --Sir, stammered the dazed young man, I hope that no false report....
056.031 --Me! I first heard of you from my friend Wilmore, the philanthropist. I knew that he had found you in an unfortunate position, I do not know what, and did not ask him any questions: I am not curious. Your misfortunes interested him, so you were interesting. He told me that he wanted to give you back in the world the position you had lost, that he would look for your father, that he would find him; he looked for him, he found him, it seems, since he is here; finally he warned me yesterday of your arrival, giving me some other instructions concerning your fortune; that's all. I know he is an original, my friend Wilmore, but at the same time, as he is a safe man, rich as a gold mine, who, therefore, can do without his originalities without them ruining him, I promised to follow his instructions. Now, sir, do not be offended by my question: as I shall be obliged to patronize you somewhat, I should like to know whether the misfortunes which have befallen you, misfortunes which are beyond your control and which in no way diminish the esteem in which I hold you, have not rendered you somewhat a stranger to that world in which your fortune and your name called for you to make such a good figure.
056. 032 - "Sir," replied the young man, regaining his composure as the count spoke, "you may rest assured on this point: the captors who took me away from my father, and who, no doubt, had the object of selling me later to him as they did, calculated that, in order to make a good deal out of me, it was necessary to leave me all my personal worth, and even to increase it still further, if it were possible; So I received a fairly good education, and was treated by the child thieves much as were the slaves in Asia Minor whose masters made grammarians, doctors, and philosophers, to sell them more expensively at the market of Rome. "
056.033 Monte Cristo smiled with satisfaction; he had not expected so much, it seems, from M. Andrea Cavalcanti.
056.034 "Besides," resumed the young man, "if there were in me some defect of education or rather of worldly habit, one would, I suppose, be indulgent to excuse them, in consideration of the misfortunes which have accompanied my birth and pursued my youth.
056.035 -- Well," said Monte Cristo carelessly, "you may do what you like with it, viscount, for you are the master, and that is your own affair; but, my word, on the contrary, I would not say a word about all these adventures; it is a novel that is your story, and the world, which adores novels tightly bound between two covers of yellow paper, is strangely suspicious of those which it sees bound in living vellum, even if they are gilded as you may be. This is the difficulty that I will take the liberty of pointing out to you, Mr. Viscount; no sooner will you have told someone your touching story, than it will run through the world completely distorted. You will be obliged to pose as an Antony, and the time of the Antony is a little past. Perhaps you will have a success of curiosity, but not everyone likes to be the center of observations and the target of comments. Perhaps you will get tired of it.
056.036 --I believe that you are right, Mr. Count, said the young man, paling in spite of himself, under the inflexible glance of Monte-Cristo; it is a serious disadvantage.
056.037 --Oh! one should not exaggerate it either, said Monte-Cristo; for, to avoid a fault, one would fall into a folly. No, it is a simple plan of conduct to be adopted; and, for an intelligent man like yourself, this plan is all the easier to adopt as it is in accordance with your interests; it will be necessary to combat, by testimonies and by honorable friendships, all that your past may have of obscurity."
056.038 Andrea visibly lost his composure.
056.039 "I would offer myself to you as a guarantor and surety," said Monte Cristo; "but it is a moral habit of mine to doubt my best friends, and a need to seek to make others doubt; so I would be playing a part outside my job, as the tragedians say, and I would risk being hissed at, which is useless.
056.040 - "However, Sir Count," said Andrea boldly, "in consideration of Lord Wilmore, who recommended me to you....
056.041 --Yes, certainly, resumed Monte-Cristo; but Lord Wilmore did not let me ignore, dear Sir Andrea, that you had had a somewhat stormy youth. Oh," said the Count, seeing Andrea's movement, "I don't ask you to confess; besides, it is so that you don't need anyone that we have brought from Lucca Mr. Marquis Cavalcanti, your father. You'll see, he's a bit stiff, a bit stuffy; but it's a question of uniform, and when it's known that he's been in the service of Austria for eighteen years, everything will be forgiven; we're not, in general, demanding of Austrians. All in all, he is a very sufficient father, I assure you.
056.042 --Ah, you reassure me, sir; I had left him so long ago that I had no memory of him.
056.043 --And then, you know, a great fortune makes one overlook many things.
056.044 -So my father is really rich, sir?
056.045 --Millionaire... five hundred thousand pounds of income.
056.046 --So," asked the young man anxiously, "I'm going to find myself in a pleasant position?
056.047 --Most agreeable, my dear sir; it makes you fifty thousand pounds of income a year for as long as you remain in Paris.
056.048 --But I will always stay there, in that case.
056.049 --Eh! who can answer for the circumstances, my dear sir? Man proposes and God disposes...."
056.050 Andrea heaved a sigh.
056.051 "But finally," he said, "all the time that I remain in Paris, and... that no circumstance will force me to move away, is this money of which you spoke to me a moment ago assured to me?
056.052 --Oh, perfectly.
056.053 --From my father? asked Andrea with concern.
056.054 -- Yes, but guaranteed by Lord Wilmore, who has, at your father's request, opened a credit of five thousand francs a month with M. Danglars, one of the most reliable bankers in Paris.
056.055 --And my father intends to stay long in Paris? asked Andrea with concern.
056.056 -- Only a few days, replied Monte-Cristo, his service does not allow him to be absent more than two or three weeks.
056.057 --Oh! this dear father! said Andrea visibly delighted with this prompt departure.
056.058 -Also, said Monte-Cristo, pretending to be mistaken with the accent of these words; also I do not want to delay of one moment the hour of your meeting. Are you prepared to embrace this worthy Mr. Cavalcanti?
056.059 -- You don't doubt it, I hope?
056.060 --Well, come into the living room, my dear friend, and you will find your father waiting for you."
056.061 Andrea made a deep bow to the count and entered the drawing room.
056.062 The count followed him with his eyes, and, having seen him disappear, pushed a spring corresponding to a picture, which, by moving away from the frame, let, by a cleverly arranged interstice, penetrate the sight in the living room.
056.063 Andrea closed the door behind him and advanced toward the major, who rose to his feet as soon as he heard the sound of approaching footsteps.
056.064 "Ah, sir and dear father," said Andrea in a loud voice, so that the Count could hear him through the closed door, "is that you?
056.065 --Hello, my dear son, said the major gravely.
056.066 --After so many years of separation, said Andrea while continuing to look at the side of the door, what happiness to see us again!
056.067 -- Indeed, the separation was long.
056.068 --Shall we not embrace each other, sir?
056.069 --As you wish, my son," said the major.
056.070 And the two men embraced as one embraces at the Théâtre-Français, that is to say, by passing the head over the shoulder.
056.071 "Thus we are reunited!" said Andrea.
056.072 --Here we are, reunited," said the major.
056.073 --To no longer separate us?
056.074 --So done; I believe, my dear son, that you now look upon France as a second country?
056.075 --The fact is, says the young man, that I would be desperate to leave Paris.
056.076 --And I, you understand, could not live outside Lucca. I will thus return to Italy as soon as I can.
056.077 --But before I leave, my dear father, you will undoubtedly give me some papers with which it will be easy for me to ascertain the blood from which I came.
056.078 --Surely, for I have come on purpose for that, and I have had too much trouble meeting you, in order to give them to you, for us to start looking for each other again; that would take the last part of my life.
056.079 --And these papers?
056.080 --Here they are."
056.081 Andrea greedily seized his father's marriage certificate, his own baptismal certificate, and, after opening the whole with an avidity natural to a good son, he went through the two pieces with a rapidity and habit that denoted the most practiced eye as well as the keenest interest.
056.082 When he had finished, an indefinable expression of joy shone on his forehead; and looking at the major with a strange smile:
056.083 "Ah!" he said in excellent Tuscan, "is there no galley in Italy?..."
056.084 The major straightened up.
056.085 "And why is that?" he said.
056.086 --That such pieces are made there with impunity? For half that, my dearest father, in France they would send us to Toulon to take the air for five years.
056.087 --Please? said the Lucan, trying to put on a majestic air.
056.088 --My dear Mr. Cavalcanti," said Andrea, pressing the major's arm, "how much do they give you for being my father?"
056.089 The major wanted to speak.
056.090 "Hush!" said Andrea, lowering his voice, "I will give you an example of trust; I am given fifty thousand francs a year to be your son: therefore, you understand well that it is not I who will be disposed to deny that you are my father."
056.091 The major looked around anxiously.
056.092 "Eh! be quiet, we are alone, said Andrea, besides we speak Italian.
056.093 --Well, to me, said the Lucan, they give me fifty thousand francs once paid.
056.094 --Mr. Cavalcanti, said Andrea, do you believe in fairy tales?
056.095 -- No, not in the past, but now I have to believe in them.
056.096 --So you have had proof?"
056.097 The major drew a handful of gold from his gusset.
056.098 "Palpable, as you see.
056.099 --So you think I can believe the promises I have been given?
056.100 -- I do.
056.101 --And that this good man of a count will keep them?
056.102 --From point to point; but, you understand, to achieve this goal, we must play our part.
056.103 --How so?
056.104 --Me of tender father....
056.105 --Me as a respectful son.
056.106 --Since they wish you to descend from me....
056.107 --Who, _they_?
056.108 --Lady, I don't know, those who have written to you; have you not received a letter?
056.109 --I have.
056.110 --From whom?
056.111 -From a certain Abbot Busoni.
056.112 --Who you do not know?
056.113 --Who I have never seen.
056.114 --What did this letter tell you?
056.115 --You will not betray me?
056.116 -- I won't, our interests are the same.
056.117 --Then read."
056.118 And the major passed a letter to the young man.
056.119 Andrea read in a low voice:
056.120 "You are poor, an unhappy old age awaits you. Do you want to become, if not rich, at least independent?
056.121 "Leave for Paris at once, and go to claim from M. le Comte de Monte-Cristo, avenue des Champs-Élysées, n°30, the son you had from the Marquise de Corsinari, and who was taken from you at the age of five.
056.122 "This son is called Andrea Cavalcanti.
056.123 "So that you do not revoke in doubt the attention that the undersigned has to be pleasant to you, you will find enclosed:
056.124 "1. A voucher for two thousand four hundred Tuscan pounds, payable to Mr. Gozzi, in Florence;
056.125 "2. a letter of introduction to the Count of Monte Cristo, on which I credit you with the sum of forty-eight thousand francs.
056.126 "Be at the Count's house on May 26, at seven o'clock in the evening.
056.127 "_Signed_: ABBE BUSONI."
056.128 --That's it.
056.129 -What do you mean, that's it? What do you mean?" asked the Major.
056.130 --I say that I received the same about.
056.131 --You?
056.132 -- Yes, me.
056.133 --From Father Busoni?
056.134 --No.
056.135 --From whom?
056.136 --From an Englishman, a certain Lord Wilmore, who takes the name of Simbad the sailor.
056.137 --And you don't know him any more than I know Abbot Busoni?
056.138 -I do; I am more advanced than you.
056.139 --You have seen him?
056.140 -- Yes, once.
056.141 --Where?
056.142 --Ah, this is precisely what I cannot tell you; you would be as knowledgeable as I am, and it is useless.
056.143 -- And this letter told you...
056.144 --Read."
056.145 "You are poor, and you have only a miserable future: do you want to have a name, to be free, to be rich?"
056.146 --Parbleu!" said the young man, rocking back on his heels, "as if such a question were made!
056.147 "Take the post-chair which you will find fully harnessed on leaving Nice by the Genoa gate. Pass through Turin, Chambéry and Pont-de-Beauvoisin. Go to the Count of Monte Cristo's house, Avenue des Champs-Élysées, on May 26, at seven o'clock in the evening, and ask him for your father.
056.148 "You are the son of the Marquis Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and the Marquise Olivia Corsinari, as will be shown by the papers which will be given to you by the Marquis, and which will enable you to present yourself under that name in the Parisian world.
056.149 "As for your rank, an income of fifty thousand pounds a year will put you in a position to support it.
056.150 "Enclosed is a voucher for five thousand livres payable on M. Ferrea, a banker in Nice, and a letter of introduction to the Count of Monte Cristo, who has been charged by me to provide for your needs.
056.151 "SIMBAD THE SAILOR."
056.152 "Hm!" said the Major, "that is very beautiful!
056.153 --Isn't it?
056.154 --You saw the Count?
056.155 --I am leaving him.
056.156 --And he has ratified?
056.157 --Everything.
056.158 --Do you understand anything about it?
056.159 --My goodness, no.
056.160 --There is a dupe in all this.
056.161 -- In any case, it is neither you nor me?
056.162 -- No, certainly not.
056.163 -- Well, then!
056.164 --We don't care, do we?
056.165 -- Well, that's what I meant, let's go all the way and play it close.
056.166 --So be it; you will see that I am worthy of playing your game.
056.167 --I didn't doubt it for a moment, my dear father.
056.168 --You do me honor, my dear son."
056.169 Monte Cristo chose this moment to enter the salon. On hearing the sound of his footsteps, the two men threw themselves into each other's arms; the Count found them embraced.
056.170 "Well, Monsieur le Marquis," said Monte Cristo, "it seems that you have found a son after your own heart?
056.171 --Ah, sir Count, I am suffocating with joy.
056.172 -- And you, young man?
056.173 --Ah, Sir Count, I am suffocating with happiness.
056.174 --Happy father! Happy child!
056.175 --One thing only saddens me, said the major; it is the necessity in which I am to leave Paris so quickly.
056.176 --Oh, dear Monsieur Cavalcanti, said Monte Cristo, you will not leave, I hope, until I have introduced you to some friends.
056.177 --I am at the orders of Monsieur le Comte, said the major.
056.178 -- Now, come on, young man, confess.
056.179 -- To whom?
056.180 --But to your father; tell him a few words about the state of your finances.
056.181 --Ah! devil, made Andrea, you touch the sensitive cord.
056.182 -- Do you understand, Major? said Monte Cristo.
056.183 --Surely I hear him.
056.184 -- Yes, but do you understand?
056.185 -- Perfectly.
056.186 -- He says he needs money, this dear child.
056.187 --What do you want me to do about it?
056.188 -- That you give him some, of course!
056.189 --Me?
056.190 -- Yes, you."
056.191 Monte-Cristo passed between the two men.
056.192 "Here!" he said to Andrea, slipping a packet of banknotes into his hand.
056.193 --What is this?
056.194 --The answer of your father.
056.195 --From my father?
056.196 --Yes. Didn't you just suggest that you needed money?
056.197 --Yes. Well, did you?
056.198 --Well, he asked me to give you this.
056.199 --Accounting from my income?
056.200 --No, for your installation expenses.
056.201 --Oh! dear father!
056.202 --Silence, said Monte-Cristo, you see that he does not want me to say that it comes from him.
056.203 -- I appreciate this delicacy, said Andrea, by pushing his banknotes in the gusset of his pants.
056.204 --That's good, says Monte-Cristo, now, go!
056.205 --And when will we have the honor of seeing the Count again? asked Cavalcanti.
056.206 --Ah yes, asked Andrea, when will we have that honor?
056.207 --Saturday, if you like... yes... here... Saturday. I have to dine at my house in Auteuil, rue de la Fontaine, No. 28, several people, and among them M. Danglars, your banker, I will introduce you to him, he must know you both to count your money.
056.208 --Great outfit?" asked the major half aloud.
056.209 --Great outfit: uniform, cross, short breeches.
056.210 --And me? asked Andrea.
056.211 -- Oh, you, very simply: black pants, patent boots, white vest, black or blue suit, long tie; take Blin or Veronique to dress you. If you don't know their addresses, Baptistin will give them to you. The less pretentious you are in your attire, being as rich as you are, the better the effect. If you buy horses, take them from Devedeux; if you buy a phaeton, go to Baptistin.
056.212 -- At what hour can we present ourselves? asked the young man.
056.213 --But about half past six.
056.214 --That's good, we'll be there," said the major, putting his hand to his hat.
056.215 The two Cavalcanti saluted the Count and went out. The Count approached the window, and saw them crossing the courtyard arm in arm.
056.216 "In truth," he said, "here are two great wretches! What a pity that it is not really the father and the son!"
056.217 Then after a moment of dark reflection:
056.218 "Let us go to the Morrel's," he said; "I think disgust disgusts me even more than hate."
057.000 The alfalfa pen.
057.001 Our readers must allow us to take them back to this enclosure which borders on M. de Villefort's house, and, behind the gate invaded by chestnut trees, we shall find characters of our acquaintance.
057.002 This time Maximilian arrived first. It is him who stuck his eye against the partition, and who watches in the deep garden a shade between the trees and the cracking of a silk brodequin on the sand of the alleys.
057.003 Finally, the cracking so desired was heard, and instead of a shade it was two shades which approached. Valentine's delay had been occasioned by a visit from Mrs. Danglars and Eugenie, a visit which was prolonged beyond the hour when Valentine was expected. So, in order not to miss her appointment, the young girl had proposed to Miss Danglars a walk in the garden, wanting to show Maximilien that there was no fault in the delay from which he was undoubtedly suffering.
057.004 The young man understood everything with that quickness of intuition peculiar to lovers, and his heart was relieved. Moreover, without coming within earshot, Valentine directed her walk so that Maximilian could see her pass and repass, and each time she passed and repassed, a glance unnoticed by his companion, but cast on the other side of the gate and picked up by the young man, told him:
057.005 "Have patience, friend, you see there is no fault of mine."
057.006 And Maximilian, indeed, took patience while admiring this contrast between the two young girls: between this blonde with languid eyes and a waist inclined like a beautiful willow, and this brunette with proud eyes and a straight waist like a poplar; then it goes without saying that in this comparison between two natures so opposed, all the advantage, in the young man's heart at least, was for Valentine.
057.007 After half an hour's walk, the two girls went away. Maximilien realized that the end of Madame Danglars' visit had come.
057.008 Indeed, a moment later, Valentine returned alone. For fear that an indiscreet glance would follow her return, she came slowly; and, instead of advancing directly towards the gate, she went to sit on a bench, after having without affectation interrogated each tuft of foliage and plunged her glance into the depths of all the alleys.
057.009 Having taken these precautions, she ran to the gate.
057.010 "Hello, Valentine," said a voice.
057.011 --Hello, Maximilian; I kept you waiting, but did you see the cause?
057.012 --Yes, I recognized Miss Danglars; I didn't think you were so connected with that young person.
057.013 --Who told you that we were related, Maximilian?
057.014 --No one; but it seemed to me that it was evident from the way you gave each other your arm, from the way you talked: it was like two boarding school companions confiding in each other.
057.015 --We were confiding in each other, indeed," said Valentine, "she confessed to me her repugnance for a marriage with M. de Morcerf, and I confessed to her that I considered it a misfortune to marry M. d'Épinay.
057.016 --Dear Valentine!
057.017 --That is why, my friend," continued the young girl, "you have seen this appearance of abandonment between me and Eugenie; it is because, while speaking of the man I cannot love, I was thinking of the man I love.
057.018 -- How good you are in all things, Valentine, and that you have in you one thing that Mlle. Danglars will never have: it is that indefinite charm which is to a woman what perfume is to a flower, what flavor is to a fruit; for it is not all for a flower to be beautiful, it is not all for a fruit to be beautiful.
057.019 -It is your love that makes you see things this way, Maximilian.
057.020 -- No, Valentine, I swear. Here, I was looking at both of you just now, and, on my honor, while doing justice to the beauty of Miss Danglars, I did not understand that a man should become enamored of her.
057.021 --It was because, as you said, Maximilien, I was there, and my presence made you unjust.
057.022 --No... but tell me... a question of simple curiosity, and which emanates from certain ideas I have formed about Miss Danglars.
057.023 -- Oh, very unfair, though I don't know which ones. When you judge us, we poor women, we must not expect indulgence.
057.024 --With this in mind, you are very fair to each other!
057.025 --Because, almost always, there is passion in our judgments. But come back to your question.
057.026 --Is it because Miss Danglars loves someone that she dreads her marriage to M. de Morcerf?
057.027 --Maximilian, I told you that I was not Eugenie's friend.
057.028 --Eh! my God!" said Morrel, "without being friends, young girls confide in each other; you must agree that you have asked her a few questions about this. Ah! I see you smile.
057.029 -If that is so, Maximilien, it is not worth our while to have this partition of boards between us.
057.030 --Well, what did she say to you?
057.031 -- She told me that she loved no one, said Valentine; that she abhorred marriage; that her greatest joy would have been to lead a free and independent life, and that she almost wished that her father would lose his fortune in order to become an artist like her friend, Miss Louise d'Armilly.
057.032 --Ah! you see!
057.033 --Well, what does that prove?" asked Valentine.
057.034 --Nothing, replied Maximilian, smiling.
057.035 --So, said Valentine, why are you smiling back?
057.036 --Ah!" said Maximilien, "you see that you too are watching, Valentine.
057.037 --Do you want me to go away?
057.038 --Oh, no! no! But let's get back to you.
057.039 --Ah, yes, it is true, for we have scarcely ten minutes to spend together.
057.040 --My God!" cried Maximilian in dismay.
057.041 --Yes, Maximilian, you are right," said Valentine wistfully, "and you have a poor friend there. What an existence I am making you spend, poor Maximilian, you so well made to be happy! I reproach myself bitterly, believe me.
057.042 --Well, what does it matter to you, Valentine: if I find myself happy in this way; if this eternal expectation seems to me to be paid for by five minutes of your sight, by two words from your mouth, and by this profound, eternal conviction that God did not create two hearts as in harmony as ours, and did not almost miraculously bring them together, especially to separate them.
057.043 --Good, thank you, hope for both of us, Maximilian: it makes me half happy.
057.044 --What is the matter with you, Valentine, that you are leaving me so quickly?
057.045 -- I don't know; Mme. de Villefort asked me to come to her house for a communication on which, she said, a portion of my fortune depends. My God, let them take my fortune, I am too rich, and after having taken it from me let me alone and free; you will like me just as much poor, won't you, Morrel?
057.046 --Oh, I shall always love you; what does it matter to me whether I am rich or poor, if my Valentine were near me and I were sure that no one could take her away from me! But this communication, Valentine, do you not fear that it is some news relating to your marriage?
057.047 -- I don't think so.
057.048 -- However, listen to me, Valentine, and do not be afraid, for as long as I live I will not belong to another.
057.049 -- Do you think you can reassure me by saying that, Maximilian?
057.050 --Pardon! you are right, I am a brute. Well, I wanted to tell you that the other day I met M. de Morcerf.
057.051 --Well?
057.052 --Mr. Franz is his friend, as you know.
057.053 --Yes; well?
057.054 --Well, he has received a letter from Franz, announcing his forthcoming return."
057.055 Valentine paled and leaned her hand against the grate.
057.056 "Ah, my God!" she said, "if that were it! But no, the communication would not come from Mme. de Villefort.
057.057 -Why is that?
057.058 --Why? I don't know, but it seems to me that Mme. de Villefort, while not frankly opposed to it, is not sympathetic to this marriage.
057.059 -- Well, but, Valentine, it seems to me that I'm going to adore her, Mme de Villefort.
057.060 --Oh, don't hurry, Maximilien," said Valentine with a sad smile.
057.061 --And if she is averse to this marriage, if only to break it off, perhaps she will open her ears to some other proposal.
057.062 --Don't believe that, Maximilien; it is not the husbands that Mme de Villefort rejects, it is the marriage.
057.063 --How? Marriage! If she hates marriage so much, why did she marry herself?
057.064 -- You don't understand me, Maximilien; thus, when a year ago I spoke of retiring to a convent, she had, in spite of the observations she thought she had to make, adopted my proposal with joy; my father himself had consented to it, at his instigation, I am sure; it was only my poor grandfather who held me back. You cannot imagine, Maximilian, what expression there is in the eyes of this poor old man, who loves only me in the world, and who, God forgive me if this is a blasphemy, is loved only by me. If you only knew, when he learned of my resolution, how he looked at me, what reproach there was in that look and despair in those tears that rolled without complaint, without sigh, down his motionless cheeks! Ah, Maximilian, I felt something like remorse, I threw myself at his feet, crying out to him: "Pardon! pardon! my father! They will do with me as they please, but I will never leave you." Then he raised his eyes to heaven! Maximilian, I can suffer a great deal; that look of my old grandfather's has paid me in advance for what I will suffer.
057.065 --Dear Valentine! You are an angel, and I really don't know how I deserved, by sabering Bedouins to the right and to the left, unless God considered them infidels, I don't know how I deserved that you reveal yourself to me. But at last, Valentine, what interest does Mme de Villefort have in your not marrying?
057.066 -- Did you not hear me say just now that I was rich, Maximilien, too rich? I have, from my mother, nearly fifty thousand pounds of income; my grandfather and grandmother, the Marquis and Marquise de Saint-Méran, must leave me as much; M. Noirtier clearly intends to make me his sole heir. The result is that, compared to me, my brother Edward, who does not expect any fortune from Mme de Villefort, is poor. Now, Mme de Villefort loves this child with adoration, and if I had entered religion, all my fortune, concentrated on my father, who inherited the marquis, the marquise and me, would have gone to her son.
057.067 -- Oh, how strange this greed in a young and beautiful woman!
057.068 --Remark that it is not for her, Maximilian, but for her son, and that what you reproach her with as a defect, from the point of view of maternal love, is almost a virtue.
057.069 --But let us see, Valentine," said Morrel, "if you would give up a portion of this fortune to this son.
057.070 --How can you make such a proposal, said Valentine, and especially to a woman who is always talking about disinterestedness?
057.071 --Valentine, my love has always remained sacred to me, and like all sacred things, I have covered it with the veil of my respect and locked it up in my heart; no one in the world, not even my sister, has any idea of this love which I have not entrusted to anyone in the world. Valentine, will you permit me to speak of this love to a friend?"
057.072 Valentine flinched.
057.073 "To a friend?" she said. Oh, my God! Maximilian, I shudder to hear you talk like that! To a friend? And who is this friend?
057.074 -- Listen, Valentine: have you ever felt for someone one of those irresistible sympathies which, while seeing that person for the first time, make you think you have known him for a long time, and you wonder where and when you saw him, so that, unable to remember either the place or the time, you come to believe that it was in a world prior to ours, and that this sympathy is only a memory which is being awakened?
057.075 --Yes.
057.076 --Well, this is what I felt the first time I saw this extraordinary man.
057.077 --An extraordinary man?
057.078 --Yes.
057.079 --Who you have known for a long time then?
057.080 --For only eight or ten days.
057.081 --And you call your friend a man you have known for eight days? Oh, Maximilian, I thought you were more stingy with this beautiful name of friend.
057.082 -- You are right in logic, Valentine; but say what you will, nothing will make me go back on this instinctive feeling. I believe that this man will be involved in everything good that will happen to me in the future, which sometimes his deep gaze seems to know and his powerful hand to direct.
057.083 --So he is a soothsayer? said Valentine smiling.
057.084 --My faith, said Maximilien, I am tempted to believe often that he guesses... especially the good.
057.085 --Oh!" said Valentine sadly, "let me know this man, Maximilian, so that I may know from him if I will be loved enough to compensate myself for all that I have suffered.
057.086 --Poor friend! But you know him!
057.087 --Me?
057.088 --Yes. He is the one who saved the life of your mother-in-law and her son.
057.089 --The Count of Monte Cristo?
057.090 --Himself.
057.091 --Oh!" cried Valentine, "he can never be my friend, he is too much my mother-in-law's friend.
057.092 --The Count, your mother-in-law's friend, Valentine? my instinct would not fail at this point; I am sure you are mistaken.
057.093 --Oh, if you knew, Maximilian! But it is no longer Edward who reigns at home, it is the Count: sought after by Madame de Villefort, who sees in him the summary of human knowledge; admired, do you hear, admired by my father, who says he has never heard more eloquent ideas formulated; idolized by Edward, who, in spite of his fear of the Count's large black eyes, runs to him as soon as he sees him arrive, and opens his hand, where he always finds some admirable toy: M. de Monte-Cristo is not the only one who has a good sense of humour. de Monte-Cristo is not here at my father's; M. de Monte-Cristo is not here at Mme. de Villefort's: M. de Monte-Cristo is at home.
057.094 --Well, dear Valentine, if things are as you say, you must already feel or you will soon feel the effects of his presence. He meets Albert de Morcerf in Italy, it is to pull him out of the hands of brigands; he sees Mme Danglars, it is to give her a royal gift; your mother-in-law and your brother pass in front of his door, it is to have his Nubian save their lives. This man has obviously been given the power to influence things. I have never seen simpler tastes combined with high magnificence. His smile is so sweet, when he addresses it to me that I forget how bitter others find his smile. Oh, tell me, Valentine, did he smile at you like that? If he did, you will be happy.
057.095 --Me! said the girl, oh, my God! Maximilian, he does not even look at me, or rather, if I happen to pass by, he turns his eyes away from me. Oh, he is not generous, or he does not have that deep look which reads the bottom of hearts, and which you wrongly suppose him to have; for if he had been generous, seeing me alone and sad in the midst of this whole house, he would have protected me from that influence which he exerts; and since he plays, as you pretend, the role of the sun, he would have warmed my heart with one of his rays. You say he loves you, Maximilian; my God, what do you know? Men make a gracious face at an officer of five feet six inches like you, who has a long mustache and a big saber, but they think they can crush a poor girl who is crying without fear.
057.096 --Oh! Valentine! you are mistaken, I swear.
057.097 -If it were otherwise, let's see, Maximilian, if he treated me diplomatically, that is to say, as a man who, in one way or another, wants to make a name for himself in the house, he would have honored me, if only once, with that smile that you praise so highly, but no, he has seen me unhappy, he understands that I can be good for nothing to him, and he doesn't even pay attention to me. Who even knows whether, in order to court my father, Mme. de Villefort, or my brother, he will not also persecute me as long as it is in his power to do so? Let me see, frankly, I am not a woman to be despised in this way without reason; you have told me so. Ah, forgive me," continued the young girl, seeing the impression these words made on Maximilian, "I am bad, and I am telling you things about this man that I did not even know I had in my heart. I do not deny that this influence of which you speak exists, and that he does not even exert it on me; but if he does exert it, it is in a way that is harmful and corruptive, as you see, of good thoughts.
057.098 -- "That's all right, Valentine," said Morrel with a sigh, "let's not talk about it anymore; I won't tell him anything.
057.099 -- Alas, my friend," said Valentine, "I distress you, I see. Oh, how can I not shake your hand and ask your pardon! But after all I ask nothing better than to be convinced; tell me, what has this Count of Monte Cristo done for you?
057.100 -- You embarrass me greatly, I confess, Valentine, by asking me what the Count has done for me: nothing ostensible, I know that. Also, as I have already told you, my affection for him is all instinctive and has nothing reasoned about it. Has the sun done anything to me? No; it warms me, and in its light I see you, that's all. Has this or that perfume done anything for me? No; its smell recreates one of my senses pleasantly. I have nothing else to say when I am asked why I praise this perfume, my friendship for him is strange as his for me. A secret voice warns me that there is more than chance in this unexpected and reciprocal friendship. I find correlation even in his simplest actions, even in his most secret thoughts between my actions and my thoughts. You will laugh at me again, Valentine, but since I have known this man, the absurd idea has come to me that everything good that happens to me comes from him. However, I have lived thirty years without needing this protector, haven't I? Anyway, here is an example: he invited me to dinner on Saturday, which is natural at this point, isn't it? Well, what have I heard since? Your father is invited to this dinner, your mother will come. I will meet with them, and who knows what will come of it in the future? These are apparently very simple circumstances; however, I see something in them that surprises me; I draw a strange confidence from them. I say to myself that the Count, that singular man who guesses everything, wanted to find me with M. and Mme de Villefort, and sometimes I try, I swear to you, to read in his eyes whether he has guessed my love.
057.101 "My good friend," said Valentine, "I would take you for a visionary, and I would truly fear for your good sense, if I listened to nothing but such reasonings from you. What! do you see anything but chance in this meeting? In truth, think about it. My father, who never goes out, has been on the point of refusing this invitation ten times to Mme. de Villefort, who, on the contrary, is burning with the desire to see this extraordinary nabob at his house, and it was with great difficulty that she obtained that he would accompany her. No, no, believe me, I have, apart from you, Maximilian, no other help to ask in this world than from my grandfather, a corpse! no other support to seek than in my poor mother, a shadow!
057.102 --I feel that you are right, Valentine, and that logic is for you, said Maximilian; but your sweet voice, always so powerful over me, today, does not convince me.
057.103 --Nor yours either, said Valentine, and I confess that if you have no other example to give me....
057.104 --I have one, said Maximilian, hesitating; but in truth, Valentine, I am forced to confess it myself, it is even more absurd than the first.
057.105 --That's too bad, said Valentine, smiling.
057.106 --And yet," continued Morrel, "it is no less conclusive for me, a man of inspiration and feeling, and who has sometimes, in the ten years that I have been serving, owed my life to one of those interior flashes of lightning which dictate to you a movement forward or backward, so that the bullet which was to kill you passes by you.
057.107 --Dear Maximilian, why not honor my prayers with this deflection of the bullets? When you are there, it is no longer for me that I pray to God and my mother, it is for you.
057.108 -- Yes, since I have known you," said Morrel, smiling; "but before I knew you, Valentine?
057.109 -- Let's see, since you don't want to owe me anything, villain, come back to this example that you yourself admit is absurd.
057.110 -- Well, look through the boards, and see over there, at that tree, the new horse I came with.
057.111 --Oh, the wonderful beast!" exclaimed Valentine, "why didn't you bring it near the gate? I would have spoken to it and it would have heard me.
057.112 - "It is indeed, as you see, a beast of rather great price," said Maximilian. I have been in the company of a number of people for some time, and I have been in the company of a number of people for a long time, and I have been in the company of a number of people for a long time. Well, I had seen at a horse dealer's this magnificent _Medeah_, I call him that. I asked what his price was: I was told four thousand five hundred francs; I had to refrain, as you well understand, from finding him beautiful any longer, and I left, I confess, with a rather heavy heart, for the horse had looked at me tenderly, had caressed me with his head, and had pranced under me in the most coquettish and charming manner. The same evening I had some friends at home: M. de Château-Renaud, M. Debray and five or six other bad subjects whom you have the good fortune not to know even by name. They proposed a hot water bottle; I never play, because I am not rich enough to lose, nor poor enough to want to win. But I was at home, you understand, I had nothing else to do but to send for cards, and that is what I did.
057.113 "As we sat down to dinner, M. de Monte Cristo arrived. He took his place, we played, and I won; I hardly dare to admit it to you, Valentine, I won five thousand francs. We left each other at midnight. I could not hold on, I took a cabriolet and made me drive to my horse dealer. All palpitating, all feverish, I rang the bell; the one who came to open the door must have taken me for a madman. I rushed to the other side of the barely opened door. I entered the stable, I looked at the rack. Oh! happiness! _Médéah_ was nibbling his hay. I jumped on a saddle; I put it on his back myself, I put the bridle on him, and _Médéah_ lent himself with the best grace in the world to this operation! Then, depositing the four thousand five hundred francs in the hands of the astonished merchant, I return or rather I spend the night walking in the Champs-Élysées. Well, I saw the light at the Count's window, I seemed to see his shadow behind the curtains. Now, Valentine, I would swear that the Count knew I wanted that horse, and that he lost on purpose to make me win it.
057.114 -My dear Maximilian, said Valentine, you are too fantastic, in truth... you will not love me long.... A man who makes poetry like this cannot be allowed to languish in a monotonous passion like ours.... But, great God! here, they call me... do you hear?
057.115 --Oh! Valentine," said Maximilian, "by the little day of the partition... your smallest finger, may I kiss it.
057.116 --Maximilian, we said that we would be two voices, two shadows for each other!
057.117 --As you wish, Valentine.
057.118 --Will you be happy if I do what you want?
057.119 --Oh, yes."
057.120 Valentine climbed onto a bench and put, not her little finger through the opening, but her whole hand over the partition.
057.121 Maximilian uttered a cry, and rushing to the bollard in his turn, seized that adored hand and applied his ardent lips to it; but at once the little hand slipped between his own, and the young man heard Valentine flee, frightened perhaps by the sensation she had just experienced!
058.000 M. Noirtier de Villefort.
058.001 Here is what had happened in the house of the king's prosecutor after the departure of Mrs. Danglars and her daughter, and during the conversation which we have just reported.
058.002 M. de Villefort had entered his father's house, followed by Mme de Villefort; as for Valentine, we know where she was.
058.003 After greeting the old man and dismissing Barrois, an old servant who had been in his service for more than twenty-five years, the two of them took their places at his side.
058.004 M. Noirtier, seated in his large armchair with wheels, where he was placed in the morning and from which he was taken in the evening, seated in front of a mirror that reflected the whole apartment and allowed him to see, without even attempting a movement that had become impossible, who entered his room, who left it, and what was being done all around him; Mr. Noirtier, motionless as a corpse, looked with intelligent and lively eyes at his children, whose ceremonious reverence announced to him some unexpected official step.
058.005 Sight and hearing were the only two senses that still animated, like two sparks, this human matter already three-quarters fashioned for the grave; still, of these two senses, only one could reveal to the outside the interior life that animated the statue; and the look that denounced this interior life was similar to one of those distant lights that, during the night, teach the traveler lost in a desert that there is still an existing being who watches in this silence and this darkness.
058.006 Also, in this black eye of the old Noirtier, surmounted by a black eyebrow, while all the hair, which he wore long and hanging on the shoulders, was white; in this eye, as it happens for any organ of the man exercised at the expense of the other organs, had been concentrated all the activity, all the skill, all the strength, all the intelligence, spread formerly in this body and in this spirit. Certainly, the gesture of the arm, the sound of the voice, the attitude of the body were missing, but this powerful eye made up for everything: it commanded with the eyes; it thanked with the eyes; it was a corpse with living eyes, and nothing was more frightening at times than this marble face on the top of which an anger lit up or a joy glowed. Only three people knew how to understand this language of the poor paralytic: it was Villefort, Valentine and the old servant of whom we have already spoken. But as Villefort seldom saw his father, and, so to speak, when he could not do otherwise; as, when he did see him, he did not seek to please him by understanding him, all the old man's happiness lay in his granddaughter, and Valentine had managed, by dint of devotion, love and patience, to understand with her eyes all Noirtier's thoughts. To this silent or unintelligible language for any other, she answered with all her voice, all her physiognomy, all her soul, so that animated dialogues were established between this young girl and this so-called clay, more or less become dust again, and who however was still a man of an immense knowledge, of an unheard-of penetration and of a will as powerful as can be the soul enclosed in a matter by which it lost the power to make itself obey.
058.007 Valentine had thus solved this strange problem of understanding the thought of the old man in order to make him understand her thought; and, thanks to this study, it was very rare that, for the ordinary things of life, she did not fall with precision on the desire of this living soul, or on the need of this half insensible corpse.
058.008 As for the servant, since, as we have said, he had been serving his master for twenty-five years, he knew all his habits so well that it was rare for Noirtier to need to ask him for anything.
058.009 Villefort consequently needed the help of neither of them to start the strange conversation with his father that he had just provoked. He himself, as we have said, knew the old man's vocabulary perfectly, and if he did not use it more often, it was out of boredom and indifference. So he let Valentine go down to the garden, and so he took Barrois away, and after taking his place at his father's right, while Mme de Villefort sat on his left:
058.010 "Monsieur," he said, "do not be surprised that Valentine has not come up with us, and that I have drawn Barrois away, for the conference we are going to have together is one which cannot take place before a young girl or a servant; Mme. de Villefort and I have a communication to make to you."
058.011 Noirtier's face remained impassive during this preamble, while on the contrary Villefort's eye seemed to want to plunge to the depths of the old man's heart.
058.012 "This communication," continued the king's prosecutor in his icy tone, which seemed never to admit of dispute, "we are sure, Mme de Villefort and I, that it will be acceptable to you."
058.013 The old man's eye continued to remain atonic; he was listening: that is all.
058.014 "Sir," resumed Villefort, "we are marrying Valentine.
058.015 A wax figure would not have remained colder at this news than the old man's face.
058.016 "The marriage will take place before three months," resumed Villefort.
058.017 The old man's eye continued to be lifeless.
058.018 Mme de Villefort took the floor in her turn, and hastened to add:
058.019 "We thought this news would be of interest to you, sir; besides, Valentine has always seemed to attract your affection; so it remains for us to tell you only the name of the young man who is destined for her. It is one of the most honorable parties to which Valentine can aspire; there is fortune, a beautiful name and perfect guarantees of happiness in the conduct and tastes of the one we are destining for her, and whose name should not be unknown to you. It is Mr. Franz de Quesnel, Baron d'Épinay."
058.020 Villefort, during his wife's little speech, fixed on the old man a more attentive look than ever. When Mme. de Villefort pronounced Franz's name, Noirtier's eye, which his son knew so well, shivered, and the eyelids, dilating as lips might have done to let words pass, let a flash of light pass.
058.021 The king's prosecutor, who knew of the ancient relations of public enmity that had existed between his father and Franz's father, understood this fire and agitation; but nevertheless he let them pass as if unnoticed, and taking up the word where his wife had left it:
058.022 "Sir," he said, "it is important, as you well understand, near as she is to reaching her nineteenth year, that Valentine be established at last. Nevertheless, we have not forgotten you in the conferences, and we have assured ourselves in advance that Valentine's husband would agree, if not to live near us, who would perhaps interfere with a young household, at least that you, whom Valentine particularly cherishes, and who, on your side, seem to return this affection, would live near them, so that you will lose none of your habits, and that you will have only two children instead of one to look after you."
058.023 The flash of Noirtier's gaze turned bloody.
058.024 Surely there was something awful going on in the soul of this old man; surely the cry of pain and anger rose to his throat, and, unable to burst, choked him, for his face became flushed and his lips turned blue.
058.025 Villefort quietly opened a window and said:
058.026 "It is very hot here, and this heat is hurting Mr. Noirtier."
058.027 Then he returned, but without sitting down again.
058.028 "This marriage," added Mme de Villefort, "pleases M. d'Épinay and his family; besides, his family consists only of an uncle and an aunt. His mother having died when she gave birth to him, and his father having been murdered in 1815, that is to say when the child was barely two years old, he is therefore dependent on his own will.
058.029 --A mysterious assassination, said Villefort, and whose authors have remained unknown, though suspicion has hovered without falling over the heads of many people."
058.030 Noirtier made such an effort that his lips contracted as if to smile.
058.031 "Now," continued Villefort, "the real culprits, those who know that they have committed the crime, those on whom the justice of men can descend during their lives and the justice of God after their death, would be very happy to be in our place, and to have a daughter to offer to M. Franz d'Épinay to extinguish even the appearance of suspicion."
058.032 Noirtier had calmed down with a power that one should not have expected from this broken organization.
058.033 "Yes, I understand," he answered Villefort with his gaze; and that gaze expressed both deep disdain and intelligent anger.
058.034 Villefort, for his part, answered this look, in which he had read what it contained, with a slight movement of the shoulders.
058.035 Then he signaled to his wife to get up.
058.036 "Now, sir," said Mme de Villefort, "accept my respects. Would you like Edward to come and pay his respects?"
058.037 It was agreed that the old man expressed his approval by closing his eyes, his refusal by blinking them repeatedly, and had some desire to express when he raised them to heaven.
058.038 If he asked for Valentine, he closed his right eye only.
058.039 If he asked for Barrois, he closed his left eye.
058.040 At Mme de Villefort's suggestion, he blinked sharply.
058.041 Mme de Villefort, met with an obvious refusal, pursed her lips.
058.042 "I'll send you Valentine, then?" she said.
058.043 --Yes," said the old man, closing his eyes briskly.
058.044 M. and Mme. de Villefort saluted and went out, ordering Valentine to be called, who had already been warned that she would have something to do during the day near M. Noirtier.
058.045 Behind them, Valentine, still pink with emotion, entered the old man's house. It only took one look for her to understand how much her grandfather was suffering and how many things he had to tell her.
058.046 "Oh, good father," she cried, "what has happened? You've been upset, haven't you, and you're angry?
058.047 --Yes," he said, closing his eyes.
058.048 --Against whom, then? Against my father? no; against Mme de Villefort? no; against me?"
058.049 The old man nodded.
058.050 "Against me?" resumed Valentine in astonishment.
058.051 The old man repeated the sign.
058.052 "And what did I do to you, dear good father?" cried Valentine.
058.053 No answer, she continued:
058.054 "I have not seen you all day; have you then been told something about me?
058.055 --Yes," said the old man's gaze sharply.
058.056 --Let's see that I'm looking. My God, I swear to you, good father.... Ah! Mr. and Mme de Villefort are leaving here, aren't they?
058.057 --Yes.
058.058 --And it was they who said those things that upset you? What are they? Do you want me to go and ask them so I can apologize to you?
058.059 -- "No, no," said the man.
058.060 -- Oh, but you frighten me. What could they have said, my God!"
058.061 And she searched.
058.062 "Oh, I'm there," she said, lowering her voice and coming closer to the old man. Did they talk about my marriage, perhaps?
058.063 --Yes," replied the angry look.
058.064 --I understand; you are angry at me for my silence. Oh, you see, it's because they had warned me not to tell you about it; it's because they hadn't told me anything about it, and that I had surprised this secret by indiscretion; that's why I was so reserved with you. Forgive me, good Papa Noirtier."
058.065 Having become fixed and atonic again, the look seemed to reply, "It is not only your silence that grieves me."
058.066 "What is it then?" asked the girl: "Do you think perhaps that I would abandon you, good father, and that my marriage would make me forgetful?
058.067 -- No, said the old man.
058.068 --They told you then that M. d'Épinay consented to our remaining together?
058.069 -- Yes.
058.070 --Then why are you angry?"
058.071 The old man's eyes took on an expression of infinite gentleness.
058.072 "Yes, I understand," said Valentine; "because you love me?"
058.073 The old man nodded.
058.074 "And you are afraid that I am unhappy?
058.075 --Yes.
058.076 --Do you not like Mr. Franz?"
058.077 The eyes repeated three or four times:
058.078 "No, no, no.
058.079 --So you are grieving, good father?
058.080 --Yes.
058.081 --Well, listen," said Valentine, kneeling before Noirtier and putting her arms around his neck, "I, too, am very sad, for I, too, do not love M. Franz d'Épinay."
058.082 A flash of joy passed into the eyes of the grandfather.
058.083 "When I wanted to retire to the convent, do you remember that you were so angry with me?"
058.084 A tear moistened the dry eyelid of the old man.
058.085 "Well," continued Valentine, "it was to escape from this marriage which makes my despair."
058.086 Noirtier's breathing became breathless.
058.087 "So, this marriage is giving you much grief, good father? O my God, if only you could help me, if only the two of us could break up their plan! But you are without strength against them, you whose spirit is so lively and whose will is so firm, but when it comes to fighting you are as weak and even weaker than I am. Alas! you would have been such a powerful protector for me in the days of your strength and health; but today you can only understand me and rejoice or grieve with me. It is a last happiness that God has forgotten to take from me with the others."
058.088 There was such an impression of mischief and depth in Noirtier's eyes at these words, that the girl thought she read them there:
058.089 "You are mistaken, I can still do much for you.
058.090 --Can you do anything for me, dear good father?" translated Valentine.
058.091 --Yes."
058.092 Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven. It was the sign agreed between him and Valentine when he wanted something.
058.093 "What do you want, dear father? Let's see."
058.094 Valentine searched her mind for a moment, voiced her thoughts aloud as they presented themselves to her, and seeing that to everything she could say the old man constantly answered _no_:
058.095 "Come on," she said, "the great means, since I am so foolish!"
058.096 Then she recited one after the other all the letters of the alphabet, from A to N, while her smile questioned the eye of the paralytic; at N, Noirtier nodded.
058.097 "Ah!" said Valentine, "the thing you want begins with the letter N! Well, let's see, what do we want with the N? Na, ne, ni, no.
058.098 --Yes, yes, yes," said the old man.
058.099 --Ah, it's _no_?
058.100 --Yes."
058.101 Valentine went and fetched a dictionary which she placed on a desk in front of Noirtier: she opened it, and when she saw the old man's eye fixed on the leaves, her finger ran briskly up and down the columns. The exercise, in the six years since Noirtier had fallen into the unfortunate state he was in, had made the tests so easy for her, that she guessed the old man's thoughts as quickly as if he himself could have looked them up in the dictionary.
058.102 At the word _notaire_, Noirtier made a sign to stop.
058.103 "_Notaire_," she said; "you want a notary, good papa?"
058.104 The old man nodded that it was indeed a notary that he wanted.
058.105 "Must we send for a notary?" asked Valentine.
058.106 --Yes," said the paralytic.
058.107 -Does my father have to know?
058.108 --Yes.
058.109 --Are you in a hurry to get your notary?
058.110 --Yes.
058.111 --Then we'll send for him right away, dear father. Is that all you want?
058.112 --Yes."
058.113 Valentine ran to the doorbell and called a servant to ask him to send for Mr. or Mrs. de Villefort at the grandfather's house.
058.114 "Are you happy?" said Valentine; "yes... I think so: eh? it was not easy to find, that?"
058.115 And the girl smiled at the grandfather as she might have done at a child.
058.116 M. de Villefort entered, led by Barrois.
058.117 "What do you want, sir?" he asked the paralytic.
058.118 "Sir," said Valentine, "my grandfather wants a notary.
058.119 At this strange and especially unexpected request, M. de Villefort exchanged a glance with the paralytic.
058.120 "Yes," said the latter with a firmness that indicated that with the help of Valentine and his old servant, who now knew what he wanted, he was ready to sustain the struggle.
058.121 "You ask for the notary?" repeated Villefort.
058.122 --Yes.
058.123 --For what purpose?"
058.124 Noirtier did not answer.
058.125 "But what do you need a notary for?" asked Villefort.
058.126 The paralytic's gaze remained motionless and therefore mute, which meant: I persist in my will.
058.127 "To do us some bad trick?" said Villefort; "is that worth it?
058.128 "But at last," said Barrois, ready to insist with the perseverance usual to old servants, "if monsieur wants a notary, it is apparently because he needs one. So I'm going to look for a notary."
058.129 Barrois recognized no other master than Noirtier and never admitted that his wishes were contested in any way.
058.130 "Yes, I want a notary," the old man said, closing his eyes defiantly and as if to say, "Let's see if they dare refuse me what I want.
058.131 "We'll have a notary, since you absolutely want one, sir; but I'll apologize to him and I'll apologize to you, because the scene will be very ridiculous.
058.132 "Never mind," said Barrois, "I'll always go and get him."
058.133 And the old servant went out triumphant.
059.000 The will.
059.001 At the moment when Barrois left, Noirtier looked at Valentine with that malicious interest which announced so many things. The girl understood this look and Villefort too, because his forehead darkened and his eyebrow furrowed.
059.002 He took a seat, settled himself in the paralytic's room and waited.
059.003 Noirtier watched him with perfect indifference; but, out of the corner of his eye, he ordered Valentine not to worry and to stay too.
059.004 Three quarters of an hour later, the servant returned with the notary.
059.005 "Sir," said Villefort after the first greeting, "you have been summoned by M. Noirtier de Villefort, who is here; a general paralysis has deprived him of the use of his limbs and voice, and we alone, with great difficulty, manage to grasp a few scraps of his thoughts.
059.006 Noirtier made an appeal to Valentine with his eyes, an appeal so serious and so imperative that she answered on the spot:
059.007 "I, sir, understand everything my grandfather means.
059.008 --That's true," added Barrois, "everything, absolutely everything, as I was telling the gentleman when he came.
059.009 --Permit, sir, and you too, mademoiselle, said the notary, addressing Villefort and Valentine, this is one of those cases in which the public officer cannot recklessly proceed without assuming a dangerous responsibility. The first necessity for a valid act is that the notary be convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will of the person who dictates it. Now, I myself cannot be sure of the approval or disapproval of a client who does not speak; and since the object of his desires and repugnances, in view of his muteness, cannot be clearly proved to me, my ministry is more than useless and would be illegally exercised."
059.010 The notary took a step to withdraw. An imperceptible smile of triumph appeared on the lips of the king's prosecutor. For his part, Noirtier looked at Valentine with such an expression of pain, that she stood in the notary's way.
059.011 "Sir," she said, "the language which I speak with my grandfather is a language which can be learned easily, and as I understand it, I can in a few minutes bring you to understand it. What do you need, let's see, sir, to arrive at the perfect edification of your conscience?
059.012 -What is necessary for our acts to be valid, Miss," replied the notary, "that is, the certainty of approval or disapproval. One can test sick in body, but one must test sound in mind.
059.013 -- Well, sir, with two signs you will acquire this certainty that my grandfather never enjoyed the fullness of his intelligence better than at this hour. Mr. Noirtier, deprived of his voice, deprived of movement, closes his eyes when he wants to say yes, and blinks them repeatedly when he wants to say no. You know enough now to chat with Mr. Noirtier, try it."
059.014 The look that the old man gave Valentine was so wet with tenderness and gratitude, that it was understood by the notary himself.
059.015 "Did you hear and understand what your granddaughter just said, sir?" asked the notary.
059.016 Noirtier gently closed his eyes, and opened them again after a moment.
059.017 "And you approve of what she said? That is, that the signs she indicated are indeed those by which you make your thought clear?
059.018 --Yes," said the old man again.
059.019 --It was you who asked me?
059.020 -- Yes.
059.021 --To make your will?
059.022 --Yes.
059.023 --And you don't want me to retire without making this will?"
059.024 The paralytic blinked his eyes sharply and repeatedly.
059.025 "Well, sir, do you understand now," asked the girl, "and will your conscience be at rest?"
059.026 But before the notary could answer, Villefort pulled him aside:
059.027 "Sir," he said, "do you believe that a man can bear with impunity a physical shock as terrible as that which M. Noirtier de Villefort has experienced, without his own morale having been seriously affected?
059.028 -That is not precisely what worries me, sir," replied the notary, "but I wonder how we shall manage to guess the thoughts, in order to provoke the answers.
059.029 --So you see that it is impossible," said Villefort.
059.030 Valentine and the old man heard this conversation. Noirtier stopped his gaze so fixed and so firm on Valentine, that this gaze obviously called for a riposte.
059.031 "Sir," she said, "don't let that worry you: however difficult it may be, or rather however difficult it may seem to you, to discover my grandfather's thoughts, I will reveal them to you in such a way as to remove all doubts in this regard. For six years I have been close to Mr. Noirtier, and let him say it himself, if, for six years, a single desire of his has remained buried in his heart because he could not make me understand it?
059.032 -- No, said the old man.
059.033 --Let us try, then," said the notary; "do you accept the young lady as your interpreter?"
059.034 The paralytic nodded.
059.035 "Well; let's see, sir, what do you want from me, and what is the act you wish to perform?"
059.036 Valentine named all the letters of the alphabet up to the letter T. At this letter, Noirtier's eloquent glance stopped.
059.037 "It is the letter T that monsieur asks for," said the notary; the thing is visible.
059.038 --Hold on," said Valentine; then, turning to her grandfather: "Your... te...."
059.039 The old man stopped at the second of these syllables.
059.040 Then Valentine took the dictionary, and in the eyes of the attentive notary she leafed through the pages.
059.041 "Testament," said her finger, stopped by the glance of Noirtier.
059.042 --The will!" cried the notary, "the thing is visible, the gentleman wants to make a will.
059.043 --Yes," said Noirtier repeatedly.
059.044 --That is marvelous, sir, agree, said the notary to Villefort, stunned.
059.045 -- Indeed," he replied, "and even more marvelous would be this will; for, after all, I don't think that the articles are arranged on paper, word by word, without the intelligent inspiration of my daughter. Now, Valentine will perhaps be a little too interested in this will to be a suitable interpreter of the obscure wishes of M. Noirtier de Villefort.
059.046 -- No, no! said the paralytic.
059.047 --How, said M. de Villefort, is Valentine not interested in your will?
059.048 -- No, said Noirtier.
059.049 --Monsieur, said the notary, who, delighted with this ordeal, promised to tell the world the details of this picturesque episode; monsieur, nothing seems to me easier now than what just now I considered an impossible thing, and this will will be quite simply a mystical will, that is to say, one provided for and authorized by the law, as long as it is read in front of seven witnesses, approved by the testator in front of them, and closed by the notary, still in front of them. As for the time, it will hardly last longer than an ordinary will; first of all, there are the established formulas, which are always the same, and as for the details, most of them will be provided by the state of the testator's affairs and by you who, having managed them, know them. But besides, so that this act remains unassailable, we are going to give it the most complete authenticity; one of my colleagues will serve me as an assistant and, against the habits, will attend the dictation. Are you satisfied, sir? continued the notary, addressing the old man.
059.050 --Yes," replied Noirtier, radiant at being understood.
059.051 "What is he going to do?" asked Villefort, whose high position commanded so much reserve, and who, moreover, could not guess at what goal his father was aiming.
059.052 He therefore turned to send for the second notary designated by the first; but Barrois, who had heard everything and guessed his master's desire, had already left.
059.053 Then the king's prosecutor told his wife to go upstairs.
059.054 After a quarter of an hour, everyone was gathered in the paralytic's room, and the second notary had arrived.
059.055 In a few words the two ministerial officers were in agreement. A vague, banal formula of the will was read to Noirtier; then to begin, so to speak, the investigation of his intelligence, the first notary turned to his side and said:
059.056 "When one makes a will, sir, it is in favor of someone.
059.057 --Yes," said Noirtier.
059.058 --Do you have any idea how much money you have?
059.059 -- Yes.
059.060 --I will name you several figures that will rise successively; you will stop me when I have reached the one you believe to be yours.
059.061 --Yes."
059.062 There was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation; moreover never had the struggle of intelligence against matter been perhaps more visible; and if it was not a sublime, as we were about to say, it was at least a curious spectacle.
059.063 There was a circle around Villefort; the second notary was seated at a table, ready to write; the first notary stood before him and questioned.
059.064 "Your fortune exceeds three hundred thousand francs, does it not?
059.065 Noirtier nodded.
059.066 "Do you have four hundred thousand francs?" the notary asked.
059.067 Noirtier remained motionless.
059.068 "Five hundred thousand?
059.069 Same immobility.
059.070 "Six hundred thousand? seven hundred thousand? eight hundred thousand? nine hundred thousand?
059.071 Noirtier nodded.
059.072 "You have nine hundred thousand francs?
059.073 --Yes.
059.074 --In real estate?" asked the notary.
059.075 Noirtier nodded.
059.076 "In annuities?
059.077 Noirtier nodded.
059.078 "Are these inscriptions in your hands?
059.079 A glance addressed to Barrois sent the old servant out, who returned a moment later with a small cassette.
059.080 "Will you allow this box to be opened?" asked the notary.
059.081 Noirtier nodded.
059.082 They opened the box and found nine hundred thousand francs worth of entries in the ledger.
059.083 The first notary passed each entry, one after the other, to his colleague; the account was there, as Noirtier had accused.
059.084 "That's right," he said; "it's obvious that the intelligence is in all its strength and in all its extent."
059.085 Then, turning back to the paralytic:
059.086 "So," he said to him, "you possess nine hundred thousand francs of capital, which, in the way they are invested, must produce for you forty thousand pounds of annuity about?
059.087 -- Yes," said Noirtier.
059.088 --To whom do you wish to leave this fortune?
059.089 --Oh!" said Mme. de Villefort, "that is not in doubt; M. Noirtier loves only his granddaughter, Mlle. Valentine de Villefort: she has been taking care of him for the last six years; by her assiduous care she has captured her grandfather's affection, and I would almost say his gratitude; it is therefore only fair that she should receive the price of her devotion.
059.090 Noirtier's eye flashed as if he were not fooled by this false assent given by Mme. de Villefort to the intentions she supposed him to have.
059.091 "Is it therefore to Miss Valentine de Villefort that you are leaving these nine hundred thousand francs?" asked the notary, who thought he had only to record this clause, but who was anxious to make sure of Noirtier's assent, and wanted to have this assent noted by all the witnesses to this strange scene.
059.092 Valentine had taken a step backwards and was crying, his eyes lowered; the old man looked at her for a moment with an expression of deep tenderness; then turning back to the notary, he blinked his eyes in the most significant way.
059.093 "No?" said the notary; "how can it not be Miss Valentine de Villefort whom you institute as your universal legatee?"
059.094 Noirtier nodded.
059.095 "You are not mistaken?" exclaimed the astonished notary; "you do say no?
059.096 --No!" repeated Noirtier, "no!
059.097 Valentine raised her head; she was stunned, not by her expletive, but by having provoked the feeling that usually dictates such acts.
059.098 But Noirtier looked at her with such a profound expression of tenderness that she exclaimed:
059.099 "Oh, my good father, I can see that it is only your fortune that you are taking away from me, but you are still leaving me your heart?
059.100 --Oh, yes, certainly, said the eyes of the paralytic, closing with an expression that Valentine could not mistake.
059.101 --Thank you! thank you!" murmured the girl.
059.102 However, this refusal had given rise to an unexpected hope in Mme de Villefort's heart; she approached the old man.
059.103 "So it is to your grandson Édouard de Villefort that you are leaving your fortune, dear Monsieur Noirtier?" asked the mother.
059.104 The blink of the eyes was terrible: it almost expressed hatred.
059.105 "No," said the notary; "then it's your son here?
059.106 --No," replied the old man.
059.107 The two notaries looked at each other stunned; Villefort and his wife felt themselves blushing, one with shame, the other with anger.
059.108 "But, what have we done to you, father," said Valentine; "do you not love us anymore?"
059.109 The old man's gaze passed quickly over his son, over his daughter-in-law, and came to rest on Valentine with an expression of deep tenderness.
059.110 "Well," she said, "if you love me, let's see, good father, try to combine this love with what you are doing at this moment. You know me, you know that I have never thought of your fortune: besides, they say that I am rich on my mother's side, too rich; explain yourself then."
059.111 Noirtier fixed his ardent gaze on Valentine's hand.
059.112 "My hand?" she said.
059.113 --Yes," said Noirtier.
059.114 --Her hand!" repeated all those present.
059.115 --Ah! gentlemen, you see that everything is useless, and that my poor father is mad, said Villefort.
059.116 --Oh! cried Valentine suddenly, I understand! My marriage, isn't it, good father?
059.117 -- "Yes, yes, yes," repeated the paralytic three times, throwing a flash of lightning each time his eyelid was raised.
059.118 --You're mad at us about the wedding, aren't you?
059.119 --Yes.
059.120 --But that's absurd, said Villefort.
059.121 --Pardon, sir, said the notary, all that, on the contrary, is very logical and seems to me to fit together perfectly.
059.122 --Do you not want me to marry Mr. Franz d'Épinay?
059.123 -- No, I don't want to, expressed the eye of the old man.
059.124 --And you disinherit your granddaughter, cried the notary, because she is marrying against your will?
059.125 -- Yes, replied Noirtier.
059.126 -So that without this marriage she would be your heiress?
059.127 --Yes."
059.128 There was then a profound silence around the old man.
059.129 The two notaries consulted each other; Valentine, with clasped hands, looked at her grandfather with a grateful smile; Villefort bit his thin lips; Mme. de Villefort could not repress a joyous feeling which, in spite of herself, blossomed on her face.
059.130 "But," said Villefort at last, breaking the silence first, "it seems to me that I alone am the judge of the propriety of this union. As sole master of my daughter's hand, I want her to marry M. Franz d'Épinay, and she will marry him."
059.131 Valentine fell weeping into an armchair.
059.132 "Sir," said the notary, addressing the old man, "what do you intend to do with your fortune in case Miss Valentine marries Mr. Franz?
059.133 The old man remained motionless.
059.134 "You intend to dispose of it, though?
059.135 -- Yes," said Noirtier.
059.136 --In favor of someone in your family?
059.137 -- No.
059.138 -- In favor of the poor, then?
059.139 -- Yes.
059.140 --But, said the notary, you know that the law is against you stripping your son entirely?
059.141 --Yes.
059.142 --You will therefore dispose of only that part which the law authorizes you to divest."
059.143 Noirtier remained motionless.
059.144 "You still want to dispose of everything?
059.145 --Yes.
059.146 --But after your death the will will be attacked!
059.147 --No.
059.148 --My father knows me, sir," said M. de Villefort, "he knows that his will will be sacred to me; besides, he understands that in my position I cannot plead against the poor.
059.149 Noirtier's eye expressed triumph.
059.150 "What have you decided, sir?" the notary asked Villefort.
059.151 -Nothing, sir, it is a resolution taken in the mind of my father, and I know that my father does not change his resolution. I therefore resign myself. These nine hundred thousand francs will leave the family to go and enrich the hospitals; but I will not yield to an old man's whim, and I will do according to my conscience."
059.152 And Villefort retired with his wife, leaving his father free to test as he saw fit.
059.153 The same day the will was made; the witnesses were fetched, it was approved by the old man, closed in their presence and deposited with M. Deschamps, the family notary.
060.000 The telegraph.
060.001 M. and Mme de Villefort learned, on returning home, that M. le Comte de Monte-Cristo, who had come to visit them, had been introduced into the salon, where he was waiting for them; Mme de Villefort, too excited to enter suddenly, passed through her bedroom, while the King's Prosecutor, more sure of himself, went directly to the salon.
060.002 But however much he mastered his sensations, however well he knew how to compose his face, M. de Villefort could not so well remove the cloud from his forehead that the Count, whose smile was shining radiantly, did not notice that dark and dreamy air.
060.003 "Oh, my God!" said Monte Cristo after the first compliments, "what is the matter with you, Monsieur de Villefort?
060.004 Villefort tried to smile.
060.005 "No, Monsieur le Comte," he said, "there is no other victim here but myself. I am the one who is losing my trial, and it is chance, stubbornness, madness that has launched the indictment.
060.006 --What do you mean?" asked Monte Cristo with perfectly played interest. Has some serious misfortune actually befallen you?
060.007 -- "Oh, Monsieur le Comte," said Villefort, with a calmness full of bitterness, "it is not worth talking about; almost nothing, a simple loss of money.
060.008 --In effect," replied Monte Cristo, "a loss of money is little with a fortune such as you possess and with a philosophical and elevated mind such as yours.
060.009 - "So," replied Villefort, "it is not the question of money that worries me, although, after all, nine hundred thousand francs is worth a regret, or at least a movement of spite. But I am especially hurt by this disposition of fate, of chance, of fatality, I don't know how to name the power which directs the blow which strikes me and which reverses my hopes of fortune and perhaps destroys the future of my daughter by the caprice of an old man fallen into childhood.
060.010 --Eh! my God! what is this?" cried the count. Nine hundred thousand francs, did you say? But, in truth, as you say, the sum is worth regretting, even by a philosopher. And who gives you this grief.
060.011 --My father, whom I told you about.
060.012 --Mr. Noirtier; really! But you told me, I think, that he was completely paralyzed, and that all his faculties were destroyed?
060.013 -- Yes, his physical faculties, for he cannot move, he cannot speak, and with all that, however, he thinks, he wants, he acts as you see. I left him five minutes ago, and at the moment he is busy dictating a will to two notaries.
060.014 --But then he spoke?
060.015 --He did better, he made himself understood.
060.016 --How did he do that?
060.017 --With the help of his eyes; his eyes continued to live, and you see, they kill.
060.018 -Mon ami, said Mme de Villefort, who had just entered in her turn, perhaps you are exaggerating the situation?
060.019 --Madame..." said the Count, bowing.
060.020 Mme de Villefort saluted with her most gracious smile.
060.021 "But what is M. de Villefort saying to me?" asked Monte Cristo; "and what incomprehensible disgrace?
060.022 --Incomprehensible, that is the word!" said the king's prosecutor, shrugging his shoulders, "an old man's caprice!
060.023 --And there is no way to make him reconsider this decision?
060.024 -So done, said Mme. de Villefort; and it even depends on my husband that this will, instead of being made to the detriment of Valentine, be made on the contrary in her favor."
060.025 The count, seeing that the two spouses were beginning to speak in parables, assumed a distracted air, and looked with the deepest attention and the most marked approval at Edouard, who was pouring ink into the birds' trough.
060.026 "My dear," said Villefort, answering his wife, "you know that I do not like to pose as a patriarch in my own home, and that I have never believed that the fate of the universe depended on a nod from my head. However, it is important that my decisions be respected in my family, and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child do not reverse a project that has been in my mind for many years. The Baron d'Epinay was my friend, as you know, and an alliance with his son was most appropriate.
060.027 -- You think," said Mme. de Villefort, "that Valentine agrees with him? Indeed, she has always been opposed to this marriage, and I would not be surprised if everything we have just seen and heard were the execution of a plan concerted between them.
060.028 --Madame, said Villefort, one does not give up a fortune of nine hundred thousand francs like that, believe me.
060.029 -- She would renounce the world, sir, since a year ago she wanted to enter a convent.
060.030 --Never mind," said de Villefort, "I say that this marriage must take place, madame!
060.031 --Despite your father's wishes? said Mme. de Villefort, striking another cord: "It is very serious!
060.032 Monte Cristo pretended not to listen, and did not lose a word of what was said.
060.033 "Madame," resumed Villefort, "I can say that I have always respected my father, because to the natural feeling of descent was added in me the consciousness of his moral superiority; because a father is sacred in two respects, sacred as our creator, sacred as our master; but today I must renounce recognizing an intelligence in the old man who, on a simple recollection of hatred for the father, pursues the son in this way; it would be ridiculous for me to conform my conduct to his whims. I will continue to have the greatest respect for Mr. Noirtier; I will suffer without complaint the pecuniary punishment he inflicts on me, but I will remain immutable in my will, and the world will appreciate on which side sound reason was. Consequently, I will marry my daughter to Baron Franz d'Épinay, because this marriage is, in my opinion, good and honorable, and I want to marry my daughter to whom I please.
060.034 -- "What!" said the count, whose approval the king's attorney had constantly sought with his eyes; "what! M. Noirtier disinherits, you say, Miss Valentine, because she is going to marry M. Baron Franz d'Épinay?
060.035 --Eh! mon Dieu! oui! oui, monsieur; voilà la raison," said Villefort, shrugging his shoulders.
060.036 - "The visible reason at least," added Mme. de Villefort.
060.037 -The real reason, madame. Believe me, I know my father.
060.038 --Do we understand that?" replied the young woman. "In what way, I ask you, does M. d'Épinay displease M. Noirtier more than any other?
060.039 -- Indeed, said the Count, I knew M. Franz d'Épinay, the son of General de Quesnel, was he not, who was made Baron d'Épinay by King Charles X?
060.040 -- Just so, said Villefort.
060.041 -- Well, but he is a charming young man, it seems to me!
060.042 --And this is only a pretext, I am sure, said Mme. de Villefort; old men are tyrants of their affections; M. Noirtier does not want his granddaughter to marry.
060.043 --But, said Monte Cristo, do you not know a cause for this hatred?
060.044 --Eh! my God! who can know?
060.045 --Some political antipathy perhaps?
060.046 -- Indeed, my father and M. d'Épinay's father lived in stormy times of which I have only seen the last days, said Villefort.
060.047 --Wasn't your father a Bonapartist?" asked Monte Cristo. I think I remember you telling me something like that.
060.048 -My father was a Jacobin before all things, Villefort continued, carried away by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence, and the senator's robe that Napoleon had thrown over his shoulders only disguised the old man, but without having changed him. When my father conspired, it was not for the Emperor, it was against the Bourbons; for my father had that terrible thing in him, that he never fought for unattainable utopias, but for possible things, and that he applied to the success of these possible things those terrible theories of the Montagne, which did not shrink from any means.
060.049 --Well, said Monte Cristo, you see, that's it, M. Noirtier and M. d'Épinay will have met on the soil of politics. M. general d'Épinay, though he had served under Napoleon, had he not in the depths of his heart retained royalist sentiments, and was he not the same one who was murdered one evening leaving a Napoleonic club, where he had been lured in the hope of finding in him a brother?"
060.050 Villefort looked at the count almost with terror.
060.051 "Am I mistaken?" said Monte Cristo.
060.052 -- "No, sir," said Mme. de Villefort, "and it is precisely because of what you have just said that, in order to see old hatreds extinguished, M. de Villefort had the idea of making two children whose fathers had hated each other love each other.
060.053 -- A sublime idea!" said Monte Cristo, "an idea full of charity and one which the world should applaud. Indeed, it was beautiful to see Mlle. Noirtier de Villefort called Mme Franz d'Épinay."
060.054 Villefort flinched and looked at Monte Cristo as if he wanted to read in the depths of his heart the intention that had dictated the words he had just uttered.
060.055 But the Count kept the stereotyped benevolent smile on his lips; and this time again, in spite of the depth of his gaze, the King's Prosecutor did not see beyond the epidermis.
060.056 "Also," resumed Villefort, "although it is a great misfortune for Valentine to lose his grandfather's fortune, I do not believe, however, that for that reason the marriage is lacking; I do not believe that M. d'Épinay will recoil from this pecuniary failure; he will see that I am perhaps worth more than the sum, I who sacrifice it to the desire to keep my word to him; he will calculate that Valentine, moreover, is rich in her mother's property, administered by M. and Mme de Saint-Méran, her maternal ancestors, who both cherish her tenderly.
060.057 --And who are well worth loving and caring for as Valentine has done for M. Noirtier," said Mme. de Villefort; "besides, they will come to Paris in a month at most, and Valentine, after such an affront, will be excused from burying herself as she has done hitherto with M. Noirtier."
060.058 The count listened with complacency to the discordant voice of these wounded loves-owns and bruised interests.
060.059 "But it seems to me," said Monte Cristo after a moment's silence, "and I beg your pardon in advance for what I am going to say, it seems to me that if M. Noirtier disinherits Mlle. de Villefort, who is guilty of wishing to marry a young man whose father he hated, he has not the same wrong to reproach to dear Edward.
060.060 --Isn't it so, sir?" cried Mme. de Villefort with an intonation impossible to describe; "isn't it unjust, heinously unjust? Poor Edouard, he is as much the grandson of M. Noirtier as Valentine, and yet if Valentine had not had to marry M. Franz, M. Noirtier would have left him all his property; and moreover, finally, Edouard bears the name of the family, which does not prevent the fact that, even supposing Valentine to be effectively disinherited by her grandfather, she will still be three times richer than he."
060.061 This blow struck, the Count listened and spoke no more.
060.062 "Here," resumed Villefort, "here, Monsieur le Comte, let us cease, I pray you, to talk of these family miseries; yes, it is true, my fortune will swell the income of the poor, who are today the real rich. Yes, my father will have frustrated me of a legitimate hope, and that without reason; but, me, I will have acted like a man of sense, like a man of heart. M. d'Épinay, to whom I had promised the income of this sum, will receive it, even if I impose the most cruel privations on myself.
060.063 -- However," continued Mme. de Villefort, returning to the only idea that was constantly whispering in her heart, "perhaps it would be better if we entrusted this misadventure to M. d'Epinay, and if he himself gave his word.
060.064 --Oh! that would be a great misfortune!
060.065 --A great misfortune? repeated Monte Cristo.
060.066 - "No doubt," resumed Villefort, softening; "a failed marriage, even for reasons of money, casts a shadow over a young girl; then old rumors, which I wanted to extinguish, would take hold again. But no, it will not be. M. d'Épinay, if he is an honest man, will see himself even more committed by Valentine's expletive than before; otherwise he would act with a simple aim of avarice: no, it is impossible.
060.067 --I think like M. de Villefort," said Monte Cristo, fixing his gaze on Mme. de Villefort; "and if I were enough of a friend of his to allow myself to give him advice, I would invite him, since M. d'Épinay is going to return, at least according to what I have been told, to tie this affair up so tightly that it could not be untied; I would at last engage in a game the outcome of which must be so honorable for M. de Villefort."
060.068 The latter rose, transported with visible joy, while his wife paled slightly.
060.069 "Well," he said, "that is all I asked for, and I shall avail myself of the opinion of such a counsellor as you," he said, extending his hand to Monte Cristo. So let everyone here consider what is happening today as not happening; there is nothing changed in our plans.
060.070 --Monsieur, said the Count, the world, unjust as it is, will, I assure you, be grateful for your resolution; your friends will be proud of it, and M. d'Épinay, even if he were to take Mlle. de Villefort without a dowry, which cannot be, will be charmed to enter a family where one knows how to rise to the height of such sacrifices in order to keep one's word and fulfill one's duty."
060.071 As he said these words, the Count had risen and was about to leave.
060.072 "You are leaving us, Monsieur le Comte?" said Mme de Villefort.
060.073 --I am forced to do so, madame; I only came to remind you of your promise for Saturday.
060.074 --Did you fear that we would forget it?
060.075 --You are too kind, madame; but M. de Villefort has such serious and sometimes urgent occupations ....
060.076 -Mon mari a donné sa parole, monsieur, dit Mme de Villefort, vous vient de voir qu'il la tient quand il a tout à perdre, à plus forte raison quand il a tout à gagner.
060.077 -- And, asked Villefort, is the meeting taking place at your house on the Champs-Élysées?
060.078 -- No," said Monte Cristo, "and that is what makes your devotion even more deserving: it is in the country.
060.079 -- In the country?
060.080 -- Yes.
060.081 --And where is that? Near Paris, isn't it?
060.082 --At the gates, half an hour from the barrier, at Auteuil.
060.083 --At Auteuil!" cried Villefort. Ah! it is true, madame told me that you lived at Auteuil, since it was to your house that she was taken. And where in Auteuil?
060.084 --Rue de la Fontaine!
060.085 --Rue de la Fontaine!" said Villefort in a strangled voice; "and at what number?
060.086 --At number 28.
060.087 -But," cried Villefort, "is it to you, then, that M. de Saint-Méran's house has been sold?
060.088 --Mr. de Saint-Méran? asked Monte Cristo. Did this house belong to M. de Saint-Méran?
060.089 --Yes," continued Mme. de Villefort, "and do you believe one thing, Monsieur le Comte?
060.090 --What is it?
060.091 -- You find this house pretty, don't you?
060.092 --Charming.
060.093 --Well, my husband never wanted to live in it.
060.094 --Oh!" said Monte Cristo, "in truth, sir, it is a prejudice of which I am not aware.
060.095 --I do not like Auteuil, sir," replied the king's prosecutor, making an effort on himself.
060.096 --But I shall not be unhappy enough, I hope," said Monte Cristo anxiously, "for this antipathy to deprive me of the happiness of receiving you?
060.097 --No, Monsieur le Comte... I hope so... believe that I will do all I can," stammered Villefort.
060.098 --Oh!" replied Monte Cristo, "I admit of no excuse. I am expecting you on Saturday at six o'clock, and if you do not come, I shall believe, what do I know? that there is some gloomy tradition, some bloody legend about this house which has been uninhabited for more than twenty years.
060.099 --I will go, Monsieur le Comte, I will go," said Villefort briskly.
060.100 --Thank you, said Monte Cristo. Now you must allow me to take leave of you.
060.101 -- Indeed, you said that you were forced to leave us, Monsieur le Comte, said Mme de Villefort, and you were even going, I believe, to tell us what to do, when you interrupted yourself to pass on to another idea.
060.102 -- In truth, madame," said Monte Cristo, "I do not know whether I will dare to tell you where I am going.
060.103 --Say it all the time.
060.104 -- I am going, as a true onlooker, to visit something that has often made me dream for hours on end.
060.105 --What is it?
060.106 -- A telegraph. Well, too bad, that's the word.
060.107 -- A telegraph!" repeated Mme de Villefort.
060.108 -- Oh my God, yes, a telegraph. I have seen sometimes at the end of a path, on a knoll, by a beautiful sun, those black and folding arms rising up like the legs of an immense beetle, and never was it without emotion, I swear to you, for I thought that those strange signs cleaving the air with precision and carrying to three hundred leagues the unknown will of a man sitting in front of a table, to another man sitting at the end of the line in front of another table, were drawn on the grey of the cloud or on the azure of the sky, by the only force of the will of this almighty chief: I believed then in genies, sylphs, gnomes, occult powers, and I laughed. But I had never wanted to see these big insects with their white bellies and skinny black legs, because I was afraid to find under their stone wings the little human genius, very gullible, very pedantic, very full of science, cabal or sorcery. But one morning I learned that the engine of each telegraph was a poor devil of an employee at twelve hundred francs a year, busy all day looking, not at the sky like the astronomer, not at the water like the fisherman, not at the landscape like an empty brain, but at the insect with the white belly, with the black legs, his correspondent, placed at some four or five leagues from him. Then I felt taken by a curious desire to see this living chrysalis closely and to attend the comedy that from the bottom of its shell it gives to this other chrysalis, pulling one after the other some pieces of string.
060.109 --And you go there?
060.110 -- I am going there.
060.111 --To which telegraph? To the Ministry of the Interior or the Observatory?
060.112 -- No, I would find there people who would want to force me to understand things I don't want to know, and who would explain to me in spite of myself a mystery they don't know. I want to keep the illusions I still have about insects; it is enough to have already lost those I had about men. I will thus go neither to the telegraph of the ministry of the Interior, nor to the telegraph of the Observatory. What I need is the telegraph in the field, to find the pure good man petrified in his tower.
060.113 -- You are a singularly great lord, said Villefort.
060.114 -- Which line do you advise me to study?
060.115 --But the busiest at this time.
060.116 --Well, the Spanish one, then?
060.117 -- Just so. Would you like a letter from the Minister to explain to you....
060.118 --But no, said Monte Cristo, since I tell you, on the contrary, that I don't want to understand anything. From the moment I understand something, there will be no more telegraph, there will be only a sign from M. Duchâtel or M. de Montalivet, transmitted to the prefect of Bayonne and disguised as two Greek words:
060.119 [Greek] It is the beast with black legs and the frightening word that I want to preserve in all their purity and in all my veneration.
060.120 -Go, then, for in two hours it will be dark, and you will see nothing more.
060.121 --Diable, you frighten me. Which is the nearest? On the road to Bayonne?
060.122 --Yes, go for the Bayonne road. It's the one in Châtillon.
060.123 --And after the one in Châtillon?
060.124 --The one by the tower of Montlhéry, I think.
060.125 --Thank you, goodbye! Saturday I will tell you my impressions."
060.126 At the door, the count found himself with the two notaries who had just disinherited Valentine, and who were retiring delighted to have made an act which could not fail to do them great honor.
061.000 The means of delivering a gardener from the dormice which eat his peaches.
061.001 Not the same evening, as he had said, but the next morning, the Count of Monte Cristo went out by the barrier of Hell, took the road to Orleans, passed the village of Linas without stopping at the telegraph which, at the very moment when the Count was passing, was moving its long emaciated arms, and gained the tower of Montlhéry, situated, as everyone knows, on the highest point of the plain of this name.
061.002 At the foot of the hill, the count put his foot down, and by a small circular path, eighteen inches wide, began to climb the mountain; arrived at the top, he found himself stopped by a hedge on which green fruits had succeeded the pink and white flowers.
061.003 Monte Cristo sought the door of the small enclosure, and did not delay to find it. It was a small wooden portcullis, rolling on wicker hinges and closing with a nail and a string. In a moment the Count knew the mechanism and the door opened.
061.004 The Count now found himself in a small garden twenty feet long and twelve feet wide, bounded on one side by the part of the hedge in which the ingenious machine we have described as the door was framed, and on the other by the old ivy-girdled tower, all strewn with ravenella and wallflowers.
061.005 One would not have said, to see it thus wrinkled and flowered like a grandmother to whom her grandchildren have just wished the festival, that it could tell many terrible dramas, if it joined a voice to the threatening ears that an old proverb gives to the walls.
061.006 One traversed this garden while following a sanded alley of red sand, on which bit, with tones which would have delighted the eye of Delacroix, our modern Rubens, a border of large boxwood, several years old. This alley had the shape of an 8, and turned while dashing, so as to make in a garden of twenty feet a walk of sixty. Never had Flora, the laughing and fresh goddess of the good Latin gardeners, been honored with such a meticulous and pure cult as was that which was rendered to her in this small enclosure.
061.007 Indeed, of twenty rosebushes which composed the parterre, not a leaf carried the trace of the fly, not a net the small cluster of green aphids which desolate and eat the plants growing on a wet ground. But this garden was not lacking in moisture: the earth black as soot, the opaque foliage of the trees, said it enough; moreover the artificial moisture would have quickly made up for the natural moisture, thanks to the barrel full of stagnant water which dug one of the corners of the garden, and in which stationed, on a green tablecloth, a frog and a toad which, by incompatibility of mood, undoubtedly, were always held, while turning their backs, with the two opposite points of the circle.
061.008 Besides, not a grass in the alleys, not a parasitic offshoot in the flowerbeds; a little mistress polished and pruned with less care the geraniums, the cactus and the rhododendrons of her porcelain jardinière than did the hitherto invisible master of the small enclosure.
061.009 Monte Cristo stopped after closing the door, stapling the string to its nail, and took in the whole property with one look.
061.010 "It seems," he said, "that the telegraph man has gardeners all year round, or engages passionately in agriculture."
061.011 Suddenly he bumped into something, lurking behind a wheelbarrow laden with foliage: this something straightened up, letting out an exclamation that painted his astonishment, and Monte Cristo found himself in front of a good man of about fifty years of age who was picking strawberries that he placed on vine leaves.
061.012 There were twelve vine leaves and almost as many strawberries.
061.013 The man almost dropped the strawberries, the leaves and the plate when he got up.
061.014 "Are you harvesting, sir?" said Monte Cristo, smiling.
061.015 --Pardon me, sir," replied the man, putting his hand to his cap, "I am not up there, it is true, but I have just come down at this very moment.
061.016 -- Let me not hinder you in any way, my friend," said the Count; "pick your strawberries, if you have any left.
061.017 --I have ten more, said the man, for here are eleven, and I had twenty-one, five more than last year. But that's no wonder, the spring has been warm this year, and what strawberries need, you see, sir, is warmth. That's why, instead of the sixteen I had last year, I have eleven this year, you see, already picked, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen. Oh, my God! I'm missing two, they were there yesterday, sir, they were there, I'm sure, I counted them. It must have been Mother Simon's son who told me about them, I saw him prowling around here this morning. Ah! the little rascal, stealing in a pen! he doesn't know where it can lead him.
061.018 -- Indeed, said Monte Cristo, it is serious, but you will make the part of the youth of the delinquent and his greed.
061.019 --Certainly, said the gardener; it is no less unpleasant. But, once again, pardon me, sir: perhaps it is a chief that I am keeping waiting like this?"
061.020 And he questioned with a fearful glance the count and his blue suit.
061.021 "Rest assured, my friend," said the Count with that smile which he made, at his will, so terrible and so benevolent, and which this time expressed only benevolence, "I am not a chief who has come to inspect you, but a simple traveler driven by curiosity and who is even beginning to reproach himself for his visit when he sees that he is making you waste your time.
061.022 --Oh! my time is not expensive, replied the good man with a melancholy smile. However it is the time of the government, and I should not lose it, but I had received the signal which announced to me that I could rest one hour (he threw the eyes on the sundial, because there was everything in the enclosure of the tower of Montlhéry, even a sundial), and, you see. I still had ten minutes ahead of me, then my strawberries were ripe, and one more day.... By the way, would you believe, sir, that the dormice eat them?
061.023 -My goodness, no, I would not have believed it, replied Monte Cristo gravely; it is a bad neighborhood, sir, that of the dormice, for us who do not eat them preserved in honey as the Romans did.
061.024 --Ah! did the Romans eat them? said the gardener; did they eat the dormice?
061.025 --I read that in Petronius, said the Count.
061.026 --Really? It must not be good, whatever they say: Fat as a dormouse. And no wonder, sir, that dormice are fat, since they sleep all day long, and only wake up to gnaw all night. Last year, I had four apricots; they took one. I had a nectarine, only one, it's true that it's a rare fruit; well, sir, they half devoured it on the side of the wall; a superb nectarine and it was excellent. I have never eaten a better one.
061.027 -- Did you eat it?" asked Monte Cristo.
061.028 --That is, the half that was left, you understand. It was exquisite, sir. Ah, lady, these gentlemen do not choose the worst pieces. It's like Mother Simon's son, he didn't choose the worst strawberries, come on! But, this year," continued the horticulturist, "you may rest assured that this will not happen to me, even if I have to stay up all night to guard the fruit when it is close to ripening.
061.029 Monte-Cristo had seen enough. Every man has his passion which bites him to the core, like every fruit its worm; that of the man with the telegraph was horticulture. He began to pick the vine leaves that hid the bunches from the sun, and thereby won the heart of the gardener.
061.030 "Monsieur had come to see the telegraph?
061.031 --Yes, sir, if that is not forbidden by the regulations.
061.032 --Oh, not forbidden in the least, said the gardener, since there is nothing dangerous, since no one knows or can know what we are saying.
061.033 -- I was told, indeed," said the Count, "that you were repeating signals that you did not understand yourself.
061.034 --Certainly, sir, and I like that much better, said the telegraph man, laughing.
061.035 --Why do you like that better?
061.036 --Because this way I have no responsibility. I am a machine, me, and not something else, and as long as I work, they don't ask more of me."
061.037 "Devil!" said Monte Cristo to himself, "would I by any chance have come across a man who had no ambition! Morbleu! That would be playing with misfortune."
061.038 "Sir," said the gardener, glancing at his sundial, "the ten minutes are about to expire; I am returning to my post. Would you like to come up with me?
061.039 -- I follow you."
061.040 Monte Cristo entered, in effect, the courtyard divided into three floors; the lower one contained a few farming implements, such as spades, rakes, and watering cans, set up against the wall: that was all the furnishings.
061.041 The second was the ordinary or rather nocturnal dwelling of the employee; it contained a few poor household utensils, a bed, a table, two chairs, a sandstone fountain, plus some dry herbs hanging from the ceiling, which the Count recognized as sweet peas and runner beans, the seed of which the good man kept in his shell; he had labeled all of this with the care of a master botanist from the Jardin des Plantes.
061.042 "Is it necessary to spend much time studying telegraphy, sir?" asked Monte Cristo.
061.043 --It is not the study that is long, it is the supernumeracy.
061.044 --And how much salary do you receive?
061.045 --A thousand francs, sir.
061.046 --That's not much.
061.047 --No; but we are housed, as you see."
061.048 Monte Cristo looked at the room.
061.049 "Provided that it does not go to hold with its housing", he murmured.
061.050 One passed to the third floor: it was the room of the telegraph. Monte Cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles with which the employee operated the machine.
061.051 "It is very interesting," he said, "but in the long run it is a life that must seem a little insipid?
061.052 --Yes, in the beginning it gives you a stiff neck from watching so much; but after a year or two you get used to it; then we have our hours of recreation and our days off.
061.053 -- Your days off?
061.054 --Yes.
061.055 --Which ones?
061.056 --The ones when it's foggy.
061.057 --Ah, that's right.
061.058 --These are my feast days; I go down to the garden on those days, and I plant, I prune, I trim: in short, time passes.
061.059 --How long have you been here?
061.060 --For ten years and five years of supernumerary work, fifteen.
061.061 --You have?
061.062 --Fifty-five years.
061.063 --How much service do you need to have the pension?
061.064 -- Oh, sir, twenty-five years.
061.065 -- And how much is this pension?
061.066 --A hundred écus.
061.067 --Poor humanity! murmured Monte Cristo.
061.068 --You say, sir?" asked the employee.
061.069 -- I say that it is very interesting.
061.070 --What?
061.071 --All that you show me.... And you understand absolutely nothing of your signs?
061.072 --Absolutely nothing.
061.073 --Have you never tried to understand?
061.074 --Never; what for?
061.075 --However, there are signals that address you directly.
061.076 --Surely.
061.077 --And those you understand?
061.078 --They are always the same.
061.079 --And they say?
061.080 --_Nothing new... you have an hour... or until tomorrow..._
061.081 --That is perfectly innocent, said the Count; but look, isn't your correspondent moving.
061.082 --Ah, that's true; thank you, sir.
061.083 --And what is he saying to you? Is it something you understand?
061.084 -- Yes; he is asking me if I am ready.
061.085 --And you answer him?
061.086 --With a sign that tells my correspondent on the right that I am ready, while he invites my correspondent on the left to get ready in turn.
061.087 --This is very ingenious, says the count.
061.088 --You will see," said the man proudly, "in five minutes he will speak.
061.089 --I have five minutes then, said Monte Cristo, that is more time than I need. My dear sir," he said, "allow me to ask you a question.
061.090 --Do it.
061.091 --Do you like gardening?
061.092 --With a passion.
061.093 --And you would be happy, instead of having a twenty-foot terrace, to have a two-acre enclosure?
061.094 --Sir, I would make it an earthly paradise.
061.095 --With your thousand francs, you live badly?
061.096 --Somewhat badly; but I live, after all.
061.097 --Yes; but you have only a miserable garden.
061.098 --Ah, it's true, the garden is not large.
061.099 --And still, as it is, it is populated with dormice that devour everything.
061.100 -- That is my bane.
061.101 --Tell me, if you had the misfortune to turn your head when the right-hand correspondent is going to walk?
061.102 --I would not see him.
061.103 --Then what would happen?
061.104 --That I could not repeat his signals.
061.105 --And then?
061.106 --It would happen that, not having repeated them by negligence, I would be fined.
061.107 --How much?
061.108 --A hundred francs.
061.109 --A tenth of your income, that's nice!
061.110 --Ah!" said the employee.
061.111 --Has this happened to you? said Monte Cristo.
061.112 --Once, sir, once I was grafting a hazelnut rose.
061.113 --Good. Now, if you were to change something in the signal, or to transmit another one?
061.114 --Then it's different, I'd be fired and lose my pension.
061.115 --Three hundred francs?
061.116 --Hundred écus, yes, sir; so you understand that I would never do anything like that.
061.117 --Not even for fifteen years of your salary? Let's see, this is worth thinking about, isn't it?
061.118 --For fifteen thousand francs?
061.119 -- Yes.
061.120 --Sir, you frighten me.
061.121 --Bah!
061.122 --Sir, you want to tempt me?
061.123 -- Right! Fifteen thousand francs, understand?
061.124 --Monsieur, let me look at my correspondent on the right!
061.125 -- On the contrary, don't look at him and look at this.
061.126 -- What is it?
061.127 --How come? Don't you know these little papers?
061.128 --Bank bills!
061.129 --Square; there are fifteen of them.
061.130 --And whose are they?
061.131 -- To you, if you like.
061.132 -- To me!" cried the suffocated employee.
061.133 -- Oh, my God, yes!
061.134 --Sir, here is my right-hand correspondent walking.
061.135 --Let him walk.
061.136 --Sir, you have distracted me, and I will be fined.
061.137 --That will cost you one hundred francs; you see that it is in your best interest to take my fifteen bank bills.
061.138 --Sir, the correspondent on the right is getting impatient, he is redoubling his signals.
061.139 --Let him do it and take."
061.140 The Count put the packet in the hand of the clerk.
061.141 "Now," he said, "that's not all: with your fifteen thousand francs you will not live.
061.142 --I will always have my place.
061.143 -- No, you will lose it; for you will make another sign than that of your correspondent.
061.144 --Oh, sir, what are you proposing to me?
061.145 -- Childishness.
061.146 --Sir, unless I am forced to....
061.147 -- I intend to force you to do so indeed."
061.148 And Monte Cristo drew from his pocket another packet.
061.149 "Here are another ten thousand francs," he said; "with the fifteen that are in your pocket, that will make twenty-five thousand. With five thousand francs you will buy a nice little house and two acres of land; with the other twenty thousand, you will make a thousand francs in income.
061.150 --A garden of two acres?
061.151 --And a thousand francs in income.
061.152 --My God!
061.153 --But take it!"
061.154 And Monte-Cristo put by force the ten thousand francs in the hand of the employee.
061.155 "What must I do?
061.156 --Nothing very difficult.
061.157 --But finally?
061.158 --Repeat the signs that are here."
061.159 Monte Cristo drew from his pocket a paper on which there were three signs all traced out, numbers indicating the order in which they were to be made.
061.160 "It won't be long, as you see.
061.161 --Yes, but....
061.162 --That's for the blow you'll get nectarines, and then some."
061.163 The blow carried; red with fever and sweating profusely, the good man executed one after the other the three signs given by the Count, in spite of the frightening dislocations of the correspondent on the right, who, not understanding anything of this change, began to believe that the man with the nectarines had become insane.
061.164 As for the correspondent on the left, he dutifully repeated the same signals, which were definitely picked up at the Ministry of the Interior.
061.165 "Now you are rich," said Monte Cristo.
061.166 --Yes, replied the clerk, but at what price!
061.167 --Listen, my friend," said Monte Cristo, "I don't want you to have any remorse; believe me, then, for, I swear to you, you have done no harm to anyone, and you have served God's plans."
061.168 The clerk looked at the banknotes, palmed them, counted them; he was pale, he was red; at last he rushed to his room to drink a glass of water; but he did not have time to reach the fountain, and he fainted in the midst of his dry beans.
061.169 Five minutes after the telegraphic news had reached the ministry, Debray had the horses put in his coupe, and ran to Danglars' house.
061.170 "Your husband has coupons from the Spanish loan?" he said to the baroness.
061.171 --I think so! He has six million worth.
061.172 --Let him sell them at any price.
061.173 --Why?
061.174 --Because Don Carlos has fled from Bourges and returned to Spain.
061.175 --How do you know that?
061.176 --Parbleu," said Debray, shrugging his shoulders, "how I know the news."
061.177 The baroness did not make herself repeat it twice: she ran to her husband, who in turn ran to his stockbroker and ordered him to sell at any price.
061.178 When it was seen that Mr. Danglars was selling, the Spanish funds dropped at once. Danglars lost five hundred thousand francs, but he got rid of all his coupons.
061.179 In the evening one reads in the _Messager_:
061.180 _Telegraphic Dispatch_.
061.181 "King Don Carlos has escaped the surveillance exercised over him in Bourges, and has returned to Spain by the border of Catalonia. Barcelona has risen up in his favor."
061.182 During the whole evening there was nothing but talk of the foresight of Danglars, who had sold his coupons, and of the happiness of the agioteur, who lost only five hundred thousand francs on such a coup.
061.183 Those who had kept their coupons or bought those of Danglars considered themselves ruined and spent a very bad night.
061.184 The next day one read in the _Moniteur_:
061.185 "It is without any foundation that the _Messenger_ announced yesterday the flight of Don Carlos and the revolt of Barcelona.
061.186 "King Don Carlos has not left Bourges, and the Peninsula enjoys the deepest tranquility.
061.187 "A telegraphic sign, misinterpreted because of the fog, gave rise to this error."
061.188 The funds went up by a figure double that in which they had gone down.
061.189 This made, in loss and loss of earnings, a million difference for Danglars.
061.190 "Good!" said Monte Cristo to Morrel, who was at his house at the moment when the strange reversal of the stock market was announced, "I have just made a discovery for twenty-five thousand francs that I would have paid a hundred thousand.
061.191 --What have you just discovered?" asked Maximilien.
061.192 -- I have just discovered the means of delivering a gardener from the dormice that were eating his peaches."
062.000 The ghosts.
062.001 At first sight, and examined from the outside, the house of Auteuil had nothing splendid, nothing of what one could expect from a dwelling destined for the magnificent Count of Monte Cristo: but this simplicity was due to the will of the master, who had positively ordered that nothing should be changed on the outside; it was only necessary to consider the interior to be convinced of this. Indeed, no sooner had the door been opened than the scene changed.
062.002 Mr. Bertuccio had surpassed himself in the taste of the furnishings and the rapidity of the execution: as once the Duke of Antin had had an alley of trees cut down in one night which obstructed the view of Louis XIV, so in three days Mr. Bertuccio had had an alley of trees planted. Bertuccio had had a courtyard planted entirely bare, and beautiful poplars, sycamores come with their enormous blocks of roots, shaded the main facade of the house, in front of which, instead of paving stones half hidden by the grass, stretched a lawn of grass, whose patches had been laid that very morning and which formed a vast carpet where the water with which it had been sprinkled still beaded.
062.003 Moreover, the orders came from the count; he himself had given to Bertuccio a plan where were indicated the number and the place of the trees which were to be planted, the shape and the space of the lawn which was to succeed the paving stones.
062.004 Seen in this way, the house had become unrecognizable, and Bertuccio himself protested that he no longer recognized it, embedded as it was in its green setting.
062.005 The steward would not have been displeased, while he was there, to make some alterations to the garden; but the count had positively forbidden that anything should be touched. Bertuccio compensated himself by filling the anterooms, stairways and chimneys with flowers.
062. 006 What announced the extreme skill of the steward and the deep knowledge of the master, the one to serve, the other to be served, it is that this house, deserted for twenty years, so dark and so sad still the day before, all impregnated that it was of this insipid odor which one could call the odor of time, had taken in one day, with the aspect of the life, the perfumes which preferred the master, and up to the degree of its favorite day; it is that the count, on arriving, had there, under his hand, his books and his weapons Under his eyes his favorite paintings; in the anterooms the dogs whose caresses he loved, the birds whose song he loved; it is that all this house, awakened from its long sleep, like the palace of Sleeping Beauty, lived, sang, blossomed, like those houses which we have long cherished, and in which, when by misfortune we leave them, we involuntarily leave a part of our soul.
062.007 Servants came and went joyfully in this beautiful courtyard: some owned the kitchens, and glided as if they had always lived in this house on stairs restored from the previous day; others populated the sheds, where the crews, numbered and pigeonholed, seemed to have been installed for fifty years; and the stables, where the horses at the rack responded by neighing to the grooms, who spoke to them with infinitely more respect than many servants speak to their masters.
062.008 The library was arranged in two sections, on either side of the wall, and contained about two thousand volumes; a whole compartment was given over to modern novels, and the one that had appeared the day before was already in its place, strutting in its red and gold binding.
062.009 On the other side of the house, mirroring the library, was the greenhouse, lined with rare plants and blooming in large Japanese pots, and in the middle of the greenhouse, a marvel for both the eyes and the sense of smell, a billiard table that looked as if it had been abandoned for an hour at most by the players, who had left the balls to die on the carpet.
062.010 Only one room had been respected by the magnificent Bertuccio. In front of this room, situated at the left corner of the second floor, to which one could go up by the large staircase, and from which one could leave by the concealed staircase, the servants passed with curiosity and Bertuccio with terror.
062.011 At five o'clock precisely, the Count arrived, followed by Ali, in front of the Auteuil house. Bertuccio awaited this arrival with an impatience mingled with anxiety; he hoped for some compliments, while dreading a frown.
062.012 Monte Cristo went down into the courtyard, walked through the whole house and went around the garden, silent and without giving the slightest sign of approval or discontent.
062.013 Only, as he entered his bedroom, located on the opposite side of the closed room, he extended his hand toward the drawer of a small piece of rosewood furniture, which he had already distinguished on his first trip.
062.014 "This can only be used to put on gloves," he said.
062.015 --In effect, Excellency," replied Bertuccio delightedly, "open it, and you will find gloves in it."
062.016 In the other pieces of furniture the Count found again what he expected to find there, flasks, cigars, jewelry.
062.017 "Good!" he said again.
062.018 And Mr. Bertuccio withdrew with a delighted soul, so great, so powerful and so real was the influence of this man on all that surrounded him.
062.019 At exactly six o'clock, a horse was heard trampling at the front door. It was our captain of the spahis arriving on _Médéah_.
062.020 Monte Cristo was waiting for him on the stoop, with a smile on his lips.
062.021 "Here I am first, I am sure!" shouted Morrel: "I did it on purpose to have you alone for a moment before everyone else. Julie and Emmanuel tell you a million things. Ah, but do you know that it is magnificent here! Tell me, Count, will your people take good care of my horse?
062.022 - Don't worry, my dear Maximilian, they know how.
062.023 -It is that he needs to be butchered. If you only knew what a train it was! A real waterspout!
062.024 --Pest, I believe it well, a horse of five thousand francs! said Monte-Cristo of the tone that a father would put to speak to his son.
062.025 --You regret them? said Morrel with his frank smile.
062.026 --Me! God forbid!" replied the Count. No. I would only regret that the horse was not good.
062.027 --It is so good, my dear count, that M. de Château-Renaud, the most knowledgeable man in France, and M. Debray, who rides the ministry's Arabs, are running after me at the moment, and are a little behind, as you see, and still they are heeled by the horses of the Baroness Danglars, who are trotting at a pace that is simply six leagues an hour.
062.028 --Then they follow you? asked Monte Cristo.
062.029 --Here they are."
062.030 Indeed, at the very moment, a coupe with a steaming carriage and two saddle horses out of breath arrived in front of the gate of the house, which opened before them. Immediately the coupe circled around, and came to a halt at the stoop, followed by two riders.
062.031 In an instant Debray had put his foot down, and found himself at the door. He offered his hand to the baroness, who made an imperceptible gesture to him as he got out, for anyone but Monte Cristo. But the count lost nothing, and in this gesture he saw a small white bill glow, as imperceptible as the gesture, and which passed, with an ease which indicated the habit of this maneuver, from the hand of Mme.
062.032 Behind his wife descended the banker, pale as if he had come out of the sepulchre instead of getting out of his coupé.
062.033 Mrs. Danglars threw around her a quick and investigative glance which Monte Cristo alone could understand and in which she embraced the courtyard, the peristyle, the façade of the house; then, repressing a slight emotion, which would certainly have shown on her face, if her face had been allowed to turn pale, she went up the staircase while saying to Morrel:
062.034 "Sir, if you were a friend of mine, I would ask you if your horse is for sale."
062.035 Morrel made a smile that looked very much like a grimace, and turned towards Monte Cristo, as if to beg him to get him out of the embarrassment in which he found himself.
062.036 The Count understood him.
062.037 "Ah, madame," he replied, "why is this request not addressed to me?
062.038 - "With you, sir," said the baroness, "one has no right to desire anything, for one is too sure of obtaining it. Also it was to Mr. Morrel.
062.039 --Unfortunately, resumed the count, I am witness that M. Morrel cannot give up his horse, his honor being committed to his keeping it.
062.040 --How so?
062.041 -- He has bet on taming _Médéah_ in the space of six months. You understand now, Baroness, that if he were to give it up before the term fixed by the wager, he would not only lose it, but it would be said that he had been frightened; and a captain of spahis, even in order to pass a whim to a pretty woman, which is, in my opinion, one of the most sacred things in this world, cannot allow such a rumor to spread.
062.042 --You see, madam... said Morrel while addressing to Monte Cristo a grateful smile.
062.043 --It seems to me, moreover," said Danglars with a gruff tone poorly disguised by his thick smile, "that you have enough of horses as it is."
062.044 It was not Mrs. Danglars' habit to let such attacks pass without retorting, and yet, to the great astonishment of the young men, she pretended not to hear and answered nothing.
062.045 Monte Cristo smiled at this silence, which denoted an unaccustomed humility, while showing the baroness two immense pots of china, on which snaked marine vegetation of such size and workmanship, that only nature can have this richness, this sap and this spirit.
062.046 The baroness was amazed.
062.047 "Eh! but, one would plant in there a chestnut tree of the Tuileries! she said; how then could one ever cook such enormities?
062.048 --Ah! madame, said Monte-Cristo, you must not ask that of us, the makers of statuettes and muslin glass; it is a work of another age, a kind of work of the geniuses of the earth and the sea.
062.049 --How this and of which epoch this can be?
062.050 -- I don't know; only that I heard that an emperor of China had a special oven built; that in this oven, one after another, twelve pots like these were baked. Two broke under the heat of the fire; the other ten were lowered to the bottom of the sea, three hundred fathoms. The sea, which knew what was required of it, threw its vines on them, twisted its corals, encrusted its shells; the whole was cemented by two hundred years under its unheard of depths, because a revolution took away the emperor who had wanted to make this test and left only the report which noted the cooking of the vases and their descent to the bottom of the sea. After two hundred years, the report was found, and they thought of removing the vases. Divers went, under machines made on purpose, to the discovery in the bay where they had been thrown; but on the ten one found only three, the others had been scattered and broken by the waves. I love these vases, at the bottom of which, I sometimes imagine, shapeless, frightening, mysterious monsters, and similar to those seen only by divers, fixed their dull, cold gaze with astonishment, and in which slept myriads of fish who took refuge there to escape the pursuit of their enemies."
062.051 Meanwhile, Danglars, not very fond of curiosities, was mechanically plucking, and one after the other, the flowers of a magnificent orange tree; when he had finished with the orange tree, he turned to a cactus, but then the cactus, of a less easy character than the orange tree, pricked him outrageously.
062.052 Then he flinched and rubbed his eyes as if he had come out of a dream.
062.053 "Sir," Monte Cristo said to him, smiling, "you who are a lover of paintings and who have such magnificent things, I do not recommend you mine. However here are two Hobbema, a Paul Potter, a Mieris, two Gerard Dow, a Raphael, a Van Dyck, a Zurbaran and two or three Murillos, which are worthy of being presented to you.
062.054 --Here! said Debray, here is a Hobbema that I recognize.
062.055 --Ah! really!
062.056 --Yes, it has been proposed to the Museum.
062.057 --Who does not have one, I believe?" hazarded Monte Cristo.
062.058 -- No, and yet he refused to buy it.
062.059 --Why is that?" asked Château-Renaud.
062.060 --You are charming, you; because the government is not rich enough.
062.061 --Ah! pardon! said Château-Renaud. I have been hearing these things every day for eight years, and I still can't get used to them.
062.062 --That will come, said Debray.
062.063 --I don't think so, replied Château-Renaud.
062.064 --Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti! Mr. Viscount Andrea Cavalcanti!" announced Baptistin.
062.065 A collar of black satin coming out of the hands of the manufacturer, a fresh beard, gray whiskers, the eye assured, a major's habit decorated with three plates and five crosses, in sum, an irreproachable dress of old soldier, such appeared Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, this tender father that we know.
062.066 Near him, covered with brand new clothes, the viscount Andrea Cavalcanti, this respectful son that we still know, advanced, the smile on the lips.
062.067 The three young people chatted together; their glances went from the father to the son, and naturally stopped longer on the latter, whom they detailed.
062.068 "Cavalcanti!" said Debray.
062.069 -- "A beautiful name," said Morrel, "peste!
062.070 --Yes, said Château-Renaud, it is true, these Italians call themselves well, but they dress badly.
062.071 --You are difficult, Château-Renaud, said Debray; these clothes are of an excellent maker, and quite new.
062.072 --That is precisely what I reproach them with. This gentleman seems to be dressing today for the first time.
062.073 --What are these gentlemen?" asked Danglars of the Count of Monte Cristo.
062.074 --You have heard, Cavalcanti.
062.075 --This tells me their name, that's all.
062.076 --Ah! it is true, you are not aware of our nobility of Italy, who says Cavalcanti, says race of princes.
062.077 --Beautiful fortune? asked the banker.
062.078 --Fabulous.
062.079 --What do they do?
062.080 --They are trying to eat it without being able to get rid of it. They have credits on you, by the way, as they told me when they came to see me the day before yesterday. I even invited them for you. I will introduce them to you.
062.081 --But it seems to me that they speak very pure French, said Danglars.
062.082 --The son was brought up in a college of the South, in Marseilles or in the vicinity, I believe. You will find him enthusiastic.
062.083 --From what? asked the baroness.
062.084 --French women, madam. He absolutely wants to take a wife in Paris.
062.085 --A fine idea he has there!" said Danglars, shrugging his shoulders.
062.086 Mrs. Danglars looked at her husband with an expression which, in any other moment, would have foreshadowed a storm, but for the second time she was silent.
062.087 "The baron seems very gloomy today," said Monte Cristo to Mme. Danglars; "would they like to make him minister, by any chance?
062.088 --No, not yet, that I know of. I believe rather that he will have played the Bourse, that he will have lost, and that he does not know who to blame.
062.089 --Mr. and Mme. de Villefort!" cried Baptistin.
062.090 The two persons announced entered. M. de Villefort, despite his power over himself, was visibly moved. As he touched his hand, Monte Cristo felt it tremble.
062.091 "Decidedly, only women know how to disguise," Monte Cristo said to himself and looked at Madame Danglars, who was smiling at the King's prosecutor and kissing his wife.
062.092 After the first compliments, the count saw Bertuccio who, occupied until then on the side of the office, slipped into a small salon adjoining that in which one was. He went to him.
062.093 "What do you want, Mr. Bertuccio?
062.094 --His Excellency did not tell me the number of his guests.
062.095 --Ah, that's true.
062.096 --How many guests?
062.097 --Count it yourself.
062.098 --Has everyone arrived, Excellency?
062.099 --Yes."
062.100 Bertuccio glanced through the half-open door. Monte Cristo was watching him with his eyes.
062.101 "Ah, my God!" he cried.
062.102 --What is it?" asked the Count.
062.103 --That woman!... that woman!...
062.104 --Which one?
062.105 --The one with the white dress and so many diamonds!... the blonde!...
062.106 --Mrs. Danglars?
062.107 --I don't know what they call her. But it is she, sir, it is she!
062.108 --Who, her?
062.109 --The woman in the garden! the one who was pregnant! the one who was walking around waiting!... waiting!..."
062.110 Bertuccio remained with his mouth open, pale and his hair bristling.
062.111 "Waiting for whom?"
062.112 Bertuccio, without answering, pointed at Villefort, with almost the same gesture with which Macbeth pointed at Banco.
062.113 "Oh!... oh!..." he murmured at last, "you see?
062.114 --What? Who?
062.115 --Him! M. the King's Attorney of Villefort? Without doubt, I see.
062.116 --But I did not kill him?
062.117 --Ah, but I think you're going crazy, my good Bertuccio, said the Count.
062.118 --But he is not dead?
062.119 -- No! Instead of hitting him between the sixth and seventh left ribs, as is the custom of your countrymen, you will have hit him higher or lower; and these people of justice, they have their souls in their bodies; or rather nothing of what you told me is true, it is a dream of your imagination, a hallucination of your mind; you will have fallen asleep having badly digested your revenge; it will have weighed on your stomach; you will have had a nightmare, that is all. Let's see, recall your calm, and count: M. and Mme. de Villefort, two; M. and Mme. Danglars, four; M. de Château-Renaud, M. Debray, M. Morrel, seven; M. Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, eight.
062.120 --Eight! repeated Bertuccio.
062.121 -Wait a minute! wait a minute! you are in a hurry to leave, what the hell! you are forgetting one of my guests. Press a little on the left... here... Mr. Andrea Cavalcanti, that young man in the black habit who looks at Murillo's Virgin, who turns around."
062.122 This time Bertuccio began a cry which Monte Cristo's glance extinguished on his lips.
062.123 "Benedetto!" he murmured softly, "fatality!
062.124 -- "There goes half-past six, Monsieur Bertuccio," said the Count sternly; "that is the hour when I gave the order to sit down to table; you know that I do not like to wait.
062.125 And Monte Cristo entered the drawing-room where his guests were waiting for him, while Bertuccio returned to the dining-room leaning against the walls.
062.126 Five minutes later, the two doors of the salon opened. Bertuccio appeared, making, like Vatel at Chantilly, a last, heroic effort:
062.127 "Monsieur le Comte is served," he said.
062.128 Monte-Cristo offered his arm to Mme de Villefort.
062.129 "Monsieur de Villefort," he said, "please make yourself Madame Danglars' escort.
062.130 Villefort obeyed, and they went into the dining room.
063.000 The dinner.
063.001 It was evident that as they passed into the dining room, the same feeling animated all the guests. They wondered what strange influence had brought them all to this house, and yet, astonished and even worried as some of them were to be there, they would not have wanted not to be there.
063.002 And yet recent relations, the eccentric and isolated position, the unknown and almost fabulous fortune of the Count, made it a duty for men to be circumspect, and a law for women not to enter this house where there were no women to receive them; and yet men and women had passed over some of the circumspection, others over propriety, and curiosity, pressing them with its irresistible spur, had prevailed over all.
063.003 There was not even the Cavalcanti father and son who, the one in spite of his stiffness, the other in spite of his casualness, did not seem concerned to find themselves united, in this man whose purpose they could not understand, with other men they were seeing for the first time.
063.004 Mme. Danglars had made a movement when she saw, at Monte Cristo's invitation, M. de Villefort approach her to offer her his arm, and M. de Villefort had felt his gaze blurred under his golden spectacles as he felt the baroness's arm rest on his.
063.005 Neither of these two movements had escaped the count, and already, in this simple bringing together of individuals, there was for the observer of this scene a very great interest.
063.006 M. de Villefort had Mme. Danglars on his right and Morrel on his left. The Count was seated between Mme de Villefort and Danglars.
063.007 The other intervals were filled by Debray, seated between Cavalcanti père and Cavalcanti fils, and by Château-Renaud, seated between Mme de Villefort and Morrel.
063.008 The meal was magnificent; Monte Cristo had taken it upon himself to completely reverse the Parisian symmetry and to give even more to the curiosity than to the appetite of his guests the nourishment they desired. It was an oriental feast that was offered to them, but oriental in the way that the feasts of the Arabian fairies could be.
063.009 All the fruits that the four parts of the world can pour intact and tasty into the cornucopia of Europe were piled up in pyramids in the vases of China and in the cups of Japan. Rare birds with the shining part of their plumage, monstrous fish lying on silver tears, all the wines of the Archipelago, of Asia Minor and of the Cape, enclosed in oddly shaped flasks, the sight of which seemed to add to the flavor of these wines, paraded like one of these reviews that Apicius passed, with his guests, in front of these Parisians who understood well that one could spend a thousand louis at a dinner of ten people, but on the condition that, like Cleopatra, one would eat pearls, or that, like Laurent de Médicis, one would drink molten gold.
063.010 Monte Cristo saw the general astonishment, and began to laugh and mock out loud.
063.011 "Gentlemen," he said, "you do admit this, don't you, that when you reach a certain degree of wealth, the only thing necessary is the superfluous, just as these ladies admit that when you reach a certain degree of exaltation, the only thing positive is the ideal? Now, continuing the reasoning, what is the marvelous? What we do not understand. What is a truly desirable good? A good that we cannot have. Now, to see things that I cannot understand, to obtain things that are impossible to have, such is the study of my whole life. I achieve this with two means: money and willpower. I put into pursuing a fantasy, for example, the same perseverance that you, Monsieur Danglars, put into creating a railway line; you, Monsieur de Villefort, into having a man condemned to death; you, Monsieur Debray, into pacifying a kingdom; you, Monsieur de Château-Renaud, into pleasing a woman; and you, Morrel, into taming a horse that no one can ride. So, for example, see these two fish, born, one fifty leagues from St. Petersburg, the other five leagues from Naples: isn't it amusing to put them together on the same table?
063.012 --What are these two fish?" asked Danglars.
063.013 -- Here is M. de Château-Renaud, who has lived in Russia, who will tell you the name of the one, replied Monte Cristo, and here is M. Major Cavalcanti, who is Italian, who will tell you the name of the other.
063.014 --This one, said Château-Renaud, is, I believe, a sterlet.
063.015 -- Wonderful.
063.016 -- And this one, said Cavalcanti, is, if I am not mistaken, a lamprey.
063.017 --That's right. Now, Mr. Danglars, ask these two gentlemen where they catch these two fish.
063.018 --But, said Château-Renaud, the sterlets are caught only in the Volga.
063.019 --But, said Cavalcanti, I only know the lake of Fusaro which provides lampreys of this size.
063.020 -- Well, precisely, one comes from the Volga and the other from Lake Fusaro.
063.021 --Impossible!" cried all the guests together.
063.022 -- Well, that is precisely what amuses me, said Monte Cristo. I am like Nero: _cupitor impossibilium_; and here, too, is what amuses you at this moment, here is what makes this flesh, which perhaps in reality is not worth that of the perch and the salmon, seem exquisite to you just now, it is that, in your mind, it was impossible to procure it and yet here it is.
063.023 --But how were these two fish brought to Paris?
063.024 --Oh, my God! nothing could be simpler: these two fish were each brought in a large barrel padded, one with reeds and river grass, the other with rushes and lake plants; they were put in a van made especially for this purpose; they lived like this, the sterlet for twelve days, and the lamprey for eight; and both were living perfectly well when my cook took hold of them to make one die in milk, the other in wine. You don't believe it, Mr. Danglars?
063.025 --I doubt it at least," replied Danglars, smiling his thick smile.
063.026 --Baptistin!" said Monte Cristo, "have the other sterlet and the other lamprey brought in; you know, the ones that came in other barrels and are still living."
063.027 Danglars opened frightened eyes; the assembly clapped its hands.
063.028 Four servants brought in two barrels lined with sea plants, in each of which was palpitating a fish like those served on the table.
063.029 "But why two of each kind?" asked Danglars.
063.030 --Because one could die, replied Monte Cristo simply.
063.031 --You are truly a prodigious man, said Danglars, and philosophers have much to say, it is superb to be rich.
063.032 --And especially to have ideas, said Mme Danglars.
063.033 --Oh, don't do me the honor of this one, madam; it was highly honored among the Romans, and Pliny relates that fish of the species he calls the _mulus_, which, according to the portrait he paints of it, is probably the sea bream, were sent from Ostia to Rome with relays of slaves who carried them on their heads. It was also a luxury to have him alive, and a very amusing spectacle to see him die, for in dying he changed color three or four times, and like a rainbow that evaporates, passed through all the shades of the prism, after which he was sent to the kitchens. His agony was part of his merit. If one did not see him alive, one despised him dead.
063.034 -- Yes, said Debray; but there are only seven or eight leagues from Ostia to Rome.
063.035 --Ah, that is true, said Monte Cristo; but where would be the merit of coming eighteen hundred years after Lucullus, if one did not do better than he did?"
063.036 The two Cavalcanti opened huge eyes, but they had the good sense not to say a word.
063.037 "All this is very kind," said Château-Renaud; "however, what I admire most, I confess, is the admirable promptness with which you are served. Is it not true, Monsieur le Comte, that you bought this house only five or six days ago?
063.038 - "My faith, at the most," said Monte Cristo.
063.039 --Well, I am sure that in eight days it has undergone a complete transformation; for, if I am not mistaken, it had another entrance than this one, and the courtyard was paved and empty, whereas today the courtyard is a magnificent lawn bordered by trees that seem to be a hundred years old.
063.040 -- What do you want? I like greenery and shade, said Monte Cristo.
063.041 -- Indeed, said Mme de Villefort, in the past one entered by a door opening on to the road, and the day of my miraculous deliverance, it was by the road, I remember, that you brought me into the house.
063.042 -- Yes, madame, said Monte Cristo; but since then I have preferred an entrance that would allow me to see the Bois de Boulogne through my gate.
063.043 -- In four days, said Morrel, it is a prodigy!
063.044 -- Indeed, said Château-Renaud, to make a new house out of an old one is a miraculous thing; for the house was very old, and even very sad. I remember having been charged by my mother to visit it, when M. de Saint-Méran put it up for sale, two or three years ago.
063.045 --Mr. de Saint-Méran? said Mme de Villefort, but this house belonged to M. de Saint-Méran before you bought it?
063.046 -- It seems so, replied Monte Cristo.
063.047 -- What do you mean, it appears that you do not know from whom you bought this house?
063.048 --My goodness, no, it is my steward who takes care of all these details.
063.049 --It is true that it has not been lived in for at least ten years, said Château-Renaud, and it was a great sadness to see it with its shutters closed, its doors shut and its weeds in the yard. In truth, if it had not belonged to the father-in-law of a king's prosecutor, it might have been taken for one of those cursed houses where some great crime has been committed."
063.050 Villefort, who until then had not touched the three or four glasses of extraordinary wine placed before him, took one at random and emptied it in one gulp.
063.051 Monte Cristo let a moment pass; then, in the midst of the silence which had followed the words of Château-Renaud
063.052 "It is strange," he said, "Monsieur le Baron, but the same thought came to me the first time I entered it; and this house seemed to me so gloomy, that I would never have bought it had not my steward done the thing for me. Probably the funny man had received some tip from the tobacconist.
063.053 - "It is probable," stammered Villefort, trying to smile; "but believe me, I have nothing to do with this corruption. I am not the only one who has been able to get the money, but I am the only one who has been able to get the money, and I am not the only one who has been able to get the money.
063.054 It was Morrel who paled in his turn.
063.055 "Above all," continued Monte Cristo, "there was a room, ah! my God! quite simple in appearance, a room like all rooms, hung with red damask, which seemed to me, I don't know why, dramatic as possible.
063.056 --Why is that?" asked Debray, "why dramatic?
063.057 -- Does one become aware of instinctive things? said Monte Cristo; are there not places where it seems that one naturally breathes sadness? We don't know; by a chain of memories, by a caprice of thought which takes us back to other times, to other places, which perhaps have no connection with the times and places in which we find ourselves; so much so that this room reminded me admirably of the room of the Marquise of Ganges or that of Desdemona. My goodness, here, since we have finished dinner, I must show it to you, and then we will go back down to the garden for coffee; after dinner, the show."
063.058 Monte-Cristo made a sign to question his guests, Mme de Villefort rose, Monte-Cristo did the same, everyone imitated their example.
063.059 Villefort and Mme. Danglars remained for a moment as if nailed to their seats; they questioned each other with cold, silent, icy eyes.
063.060 "Did you hear?" said Mme. Danglars.
063.061 -- "We must go," replied Villefort, rising and offering her his arm.
063.062 Everyone was already scattered about the house, driven by curiosity, for it was thought that the visit would not be confined to this room, and that at the same time the rest of this hovel, of which Monte Cristo had made a palace, would be visited. Each one thus rushed by the open doors. Monte Cristo waited for the two latecomers; then, when they had passed in their turn, he closed the door with a smile which, if they could have understood it, would have frightened the guests much more than this room into which they were about to enter.
063.063 They began, in fact, by going through the apartments, the rooms furnished in the oriental style with couches and cushions for beds, pipes and weapons for furniture; the salons papered with the most beautiful paintings of the old masters; the boudoirs made of Chinese fabrics, with capricious colors, fantastic designs, and marvelous cloths; and finally they arrived in the famous room.
063.064 It had nothing particular, except that, although the day fell, it was not illuminated and that it was in a state of dilapidation, when all the other rooms had put on new finery.
063.065 These two causes were enough, in fact, to give it a gloomy hue.
063.066 "Hou!" cried Mme. de Villefort, "it is frightful, indeed."
063.067 Mme. Danglars tried to stammer out a few words which were not heard.
063.068 Several observations crossed each other, the result of which was that indeed the red damask room had a sinister appearance.
063.069 "Isn't it?" said Monte Cristo. See how strangely this bed is placed, what a dark and bloody hanging! And don't these two pastel portraits, which the dampness has made pale, seem to say, with their pale lips and frightened eyes: I have seen!"
063.070 Villefort became livid, Mme. Danglars fell on a chaise longue placed near the fireplace.
063.071 "Oh!" said Mme. de Villefort, smiling, "do you have the courage to sit on that chair where perhaps the crime was committed!"
063.072 Mme. Danglars rose briskly to her feet.
063.073 "And then," said Monte Cristo, "that is not all.
063.074 --What else is there?" asked Debray, to whom Mme. Danglars' emotion was not lost.
063.075 --Ah, yes, what is it now? asked Danglars, for up to now I confess I can't see much, and you, Mr. Cavalcanti?
063.076 --Ah! said the latter, we have in Pisa the tower of Ugolin, in Ferrara the prison of Tasso, and in Rimini the room of Franscesca and Paolo.
063.077 -- Yes; but you do not have this little staircase, said Monte Cristo, opening a door lost in the hangings; look at it, and say what you think of it.
063.078 --What a sinister staircase! said Château-Renaud, laughing.
063.079 --The fact is, says Debray, that I do not know whether it is the wine of Chio that brings on melancholy, but certainly I see this house all in black."
063.080 As for Morrel, since the question of Valentine's dowry had been raised, he had remained sad and had not uttered a word.
063.081 "Do you imagine," said Monte Cristo, "an Othello or an Abbé de Ganges of some sort, descending step by step, on a dark and stormy night, this staircase with some dismal burden which he is in a hurry to hide from the sight of men, if not from the sight of God!"
063.082 Mme. Danglars half fainted on the arm of Villefort, who was himself obliged to lean against the wall.
063.083 "Ah, my God! madame," cried Debray, "what is the matter with you?
063.084 -What's the matter with her?" said Mme. de Villefort, "it's quite simple; she has that M. de Monte Cristo is telling us terrible stories, no doubt with the intention of making us die of fright.
063.085 --But yes, said Villefort. Indeed, Count, you frighten these ladies.
063.086 --What is the matter with you?" repeated Debray quietly to Mme. Danglars.
063.087 --Nothing, nothing, said the latter, making an effort; I need some air, that's all.
063.088 --Will you go down to the garden?" asked Debray, offering his arm to Mrs. Danglars and moving toward the hidden staircase.
063.089 -- No, she said, no; I'd rather stay here.
063.090 --In truth, madame," said Monte Cristo, "is this terror serious?
063.091 -- No, sir, said Madame Danglars; but you have a way of supposing things which gives illusion the appearance of reality.
063.092 --Oh, my God! yes," said Monte Cristo, smiling, "and all this is a matter of imagination; for as well, why not rather picture this room as a good and honest mother's room? This bed with its purple hangings, as a bed visited by the goddess Lucine, and this mysterious staircase as the passage through which, gently and so as not to disturb the restful sleep of the woman in childbirth, passes the doctor or the nurse, or the father himself carrying the sleeping child?"
063.093 This time Mrs. Danglars, instead of being reassured by this sweet painting, gave a groan and fainted altogether.
063.094 "Mme. Danglars is not well," stammered Villefort; "perhaps we should carry her to her carriage.
063.095 --Oh, my God," said Monte Cristo, "and I have forgotten my bottle!
063.096 --I have mine," said Mme de Villefort.
063.097 And she passed Monte Cristo a bottle full of a red liquor similar to that whose beneficial influence the Count had tried on Edward.
063.098 "Ah!" said Monte Cristo, taking it from Mme de Villefort's hands.
063.099 --Yes," murmured the latter, "on your indications I have tried.
063.100 --And you succeeded?
063.101 -- I believe so."
063.102 Madame Danglars had been carried into the next room. Monte-Cristo let fall on his lips a drop of the red liquor, she came to.
063.103 "Oh!" she said, "what a terrible dream!
063.104 Villefort clutched her wrist tightly to make her understand that she had not been dreaming. They looked for M. Danglars, but, little disposed to poetic impressions, he had gone down to the garden, and was talking, with M. Cavalcanti père, about a project for a railroad from Livorno to Florence. Monte Cristo seemed desperate; he took Mme. Danglars' arm and led her to the garden, where M. Danglars was found having coffee between M. Cavalcanti père and fils.
063.105 "In truth, madam," he said to her, "have I frightened you very much?
063.106 --No, sir, but, you know, things impress us according to the disposition of mind in which we find ourselves."
063.107 Villefort tried to laugh.
063.108 "And then you understand," he said, "it is enough to have a supposition, a chimera....
063.109 -- Well, said Monte Cristo, you will believe me if you want to, I am convinced that a crime has been committed in this house.
063.110 -Beware, said Mme de Villefort, we have the King's prosecutor here.
063.111 -My goodness," replied Monte Cristo, "since this is the case, I will take advantage of it to make my statement.
063.112 -- Your statement? said Villefort.
063.113 -- Yes, and in front of witnesses.
063.114 --This is all very interesting, said Debray; and if there really is a crime, we shall make an admirable digestion.
063.115 -- There is a crime, said Monte Cristo. Come this way, gentlemen; come, Monsieur de Villefort, for the declaration to be valid, it must be made to the proper authorities."
063.116 Monte Cristo took Villefort's arm, and at the same time as he clasped under his own that of Mme. Danglars, he dragged the king's prosecutor to under the plane tree, where the shade was thickest.
063.117 All the other guests followed.
063.118 "Look," said Monte Cristo, "here, in this very spot (and he struck the earth with his foot), here, in order to rejuvenate these already old trees, I had them dug up and put in soil; well, my workers, while digging, unearthed a chest, or rather the fittings of a chest, in the middle of which was the skeleton of a newborn child. This is not phantasmagoria, I hope?"
063.119 Monte Cristo felt Madame Danglars' arm stiffen and Villefort's wrist shiver.
063.120 "A newborn child?" repeated Debray; "hell! this is getting serious, it seems to me.
063.121 -- "Well," said Château-Renaud, "I was not mistaken when I said just now that houses had a soul and a face like men, and that they bore on their physiognomy a reflection of their entrails. The house was sad because it had remorse; it had remorse because it hid a crime.
063.122 --Oh! who says it is a crime?" said Villefort, making a last effort.
063.123 -How can a child buried alive in a garden not be a crime? What do you call that action, Monsieur le Procureur du Roi?
063.124 --But who says that he was buried alive?
063.125 -Why bury him there, if he was dead? This garden has never been a cemetery.
063.126 --What is done with infanticide in this country?" asked Major Cavalcanti naively.
063.127 -- Oh, my God! they simply cut off their necks, replied Danglars.
063.128 --Ah! their necks are cut, said Cavalcanti.
063.129 --I believe it.... I am not a man of the world, but I am a man of the world, and I am not a man of the world.
063.130 --Yes, Monsieur le Comte," replied the latter with an accent that had nothing human about it.
063.131 Monte Cristo saw that this was all that the two people for whom he had prepared this scene could bear; and not wanting to push it too far, he said, "I'm going to go to the café:
063.132 "But the coffee, gentlemen," he said, "it seems to me that we are forgetting it."
063.133 And he led his guests back to the table placed in the middle of the lawn.
063.134 "In truth, Monsieur le Comte," said Mme. Danglars, "I am ashamed to confess my weakness, but all these dreadful stories have upset me; let me sit down, I beg you."
063.135 And she fell into a chair.
063.136 Monte Cristo greeted her and approached Mme de Villefort.
063.137 "I think Madame Danglars still needs your bottle," he said.
063.138 But before Mme de Villefort had approached her friend, the royal prosecutor had already said in Mme Danglars' ear
063.139 "I must speak to you.
063.140 -- When?
063.141 --Tomorrow.
063.142 --Where?
063.143 -- At my office... at the parquet floor if you like, that's still the safest place.
063.144 --I will go."
063.145 At this moment Mme de Villefort approached.
063.146 "Thank you, dear friend," said Mme. Danglars, trying to smile, "it is nothing more, and I feel quite better."
064.000 The beggar.
064.001 The evening was drawing on; Mme. de Villefort had expressed a desire to return to Paris, which Mme. Danglars had not dared to do, in spite of the obvious discomfort she was feeling.
064.002 At his wife's request, M. de Villefort was the first to give the signal to leave. He offered Mrs. Danglars a seat in his carriage, so that she could be cared for by his wife. As for Mr. Danglars, absorbed in a most interesting industrial conversation with Mr. Cavalcanti, he paid no attention to anything that was going on.
064.003 Monte Cristo, while asking Mme. de Villefort for his bottle, had noticed that M. de Villefort had approached Mme. Danglars, and guided by his situation, had guessed what he had said to her, though he had spoken so low that Mme. Danglars herself had hardly heard him.
064.004 He let Morrel, Debray, and Château-Renaud go on horseback, and put the two ladies in M. de Villefort's carriage; for his part, Danglars, more and more enchanted with Cavalcanti senior, invited him to ride with him in his coupé.
064.005 As for Andrea Cavalcanti, he gained his tilbury, which awaited him in front of the door, and of which a groom, who exaggerated the pleasures of the English fashion, held for him, while rising on the point of his boots, the enormous iron gray horse.
064.006 Andrea had not spoken much during the dinner, by that very fact that he was a very intelligent boy, and that he had quite naturally felt the fear of saying some foolishness in the middle of these rich and powerful guests, among whom his dilated eye perhaps did not see without fear a royal prosecutor.
064.007 Then he had been taken over by M. Danglars, who, after a quick glance at the stiff-necked old major and his still somewhat timid son, by comparing all these symptoms of Monte Cristo's hospitality, had thought that he was dealing with some nabob who had come to Paris to perfect his only son in the worldly life.
064.008 He had therefore contemplated with unspeakable complacency the enormous diamond which shone on the little finger of the major, for the major, as a prudent and experienced man, lest some accident should befall his bank bills, had converted them at once into an object of value. Then, after dinner, still under the pretext of industry and travel, he had questioned the father and son about their way of life; And the father and son, warned that it was at Danglars' that his credit of forty-eight thousand francs, once given, was to be opened to them, to the other, his annual credit of fifty thousand pounds, had been charming and full of affability for the banker, to whose servants, if they had not held back, they would have shaken hands, so much did their gratitude feel the need to expand.
064.009 One thing especially increased the consideration, we will say almost the veneration of Danglars for Cavalcanti. The latter, faithful to Horace's principle: _nil admirari_, had been content, as we have seen, to show his science by saying from which lake the best lampreys were taken. Then he had eaten his share of that one without saying a word. Danglars had concluded that these sorts of sumptuousness were familiar to the illustrious descendant of the Cavalcanti, who probably fed, in Lucca, on trout that he brought from Switzerland, and on lobsters that were sent to him from Brittany, by procedures similar to those that the count had used to bring lampreys from Lake Fusaro, and sterlets from the Volga river. Also, he had received with a very pronounced benevolence these words of Cavalcanti:
064.010 "Tomorrow, sir, I shall have the honor of visiting you on business.
064.011 --And I, sir," replied Danglars, "will be happy to receive you.
064.012 Whereupon he had proposed to Cavalcanti, if, however, it did not deprive him too much of separating himself from his son, to drive him back to the Hotel des Princes.
064.013 Cavalcanti had answered that, since a long time, his son had been used to lead the life of a young man; that consequently, he had his horses and his equipment, and that, not having come together, he did not see any difficulty in their going away separately.
064.014 The major had thus climbed into Danglars' carriage, and the banker had sat down beside him, more and more charmed by the ideas of order and economy of this man, who, however, gave his son fifty thousand francs a year, which supposed a fortune of five or six hundred thousand pounds of annuity.
064.015 As for Andrea, he began, to give himself good air, to scold his bellboy that instead of coming to take him to the perron he waited for him at the door of exit, which had given him the sorrow to make thirty steps to go to seek his tilbury.
064.016 The bellboy received the warning with humility, took, to retain the impatient horse and which struck of the foot, the bit of the left hand, held out of the right the reins to Andrea, who took them and posed lightly his varnished boot on the footboard.
064.017 At this moment, a hand leaned on his shoulder. The young man turned over, thinking that Danglars or Monte-Cristo had forgotten something to say to him, and returned to the load at the time of the departure.
064.018 But instead of the two, he saw only a strange figure, tanned by the sun, framed in a model beard, eyes shining like carbuncles and a mocking smile spreading over a mouth where thirty-two white teeth, sharp and hungry like those of a wolf or jackal, were shining in their place without missing a single one.
064.019 A red-checked handkerchief topped this head with its grayish, earthy hair; a most filthy and torn burgundy covered this tall, lean, bony body, whose bones, like those of a skeleton, seemed to rattle as it walked. Finally, the hand which leaned on the shoulder of Andrea, and which was the first thing that saw the young man, appeared to him of a gigantic dimension. Did the young man recognize this figure by the light of the lantern of his tilbury, or was he only struck by the horrible aspect of this interlocutor? We cannot say; but the fact is that he flinched and drew back sharply.
064.020 "What do you want with me?
064.021 --Pardon! our burgher," replied the man, putting his hand to his red handkerchief, "I may be disturbing you, but it is because I have to talk to you.
064.022 -- One does not beg in the evening, said the bellman, making a movement to rid his master of this intruder.
064.023 --I do not beg, my pretty boy, said the unknown man to the servant with an ironic smile, and a smile so frightening that the latter stepped aside: I only wish to say two words to your burgher, who charged me with a commission a fortnight or so ago.
064.024 -- Let's see," said Andrea in turn, with enough force that the servant did not notice his confusion, "what do you want? say quickly, my friend.
064.025 -- I would like... I would like... said the man with the red handkerchief, that you would spare me the trouble of returning to Paris on foot. I am very tired, and, as I have not dined so well as you, hardly, if I can hold myself."
064.026 The young man flinched at this strange familiarity.
064.027 "But at last," he said, "let's see, what do you want?
064.028 --Well, I want you to let me get into your beautiful car, and drive me home.
064.029 Andrea paled, but did not answer.
064.030 "Oh, my God, yes," said the man with the red handkerchief, thrusting his hands into his pockets, and looking at the young man with defiant eyes, "it's an idea I have like that; do you hear, my little Benedetto?"
064.031 At this name the young man no doubt reflected, for he approached his bellboy, and said:
064.032 "This man has indeed been charged by me with a commission for which he has to render an account to me. Go on foot to the gate; there you will take a cabriolet, so as not to be too late."
064.033 The valet, surprised, walked away.
064.034 "Let me at least gain the shade," said Andrea.
064.035 --Oh! as for that, I will myself lead you in a beautiful place; wait", said the man with the red handkerchief.
064.036 And he took the horse by the bit, and led the tilbury to a place where it was indeed impossible for anyone in the world to see the honor Andrea was bestowing upon it.
064.037 "Oh, me," he said to her, "it is not for the glory of riding in a beautiful carriage, no, it is only because I am tired, and then, a little, because I have to talk business with you.
064.038 -- Let's see, get in," said the young man.
064.039 It was unfortunate that it was not daylight, for it would have been a curious sight to see this beggar sitting squarely on the brocaded cushions next to the young and elegant driver of the tilbury.
064.040 Andrea pushed his horse to the last house in the village without saying a word to his companion, who, for his part, smiled and kept silent, as if he had been delighted to ride in such a good locomotive.
064.041 Once outside Auteuil, Andrea looked around to make sure that no one could see or hear them; and then, stopping his horse and crossing his arms in front of the man with the red handkerchief, he said
064.042 "Ah," he said, "why do you come to disturb my peace?
064.043 --But you, my boy, why do you defy me?
064.044 -- And in what way did I defy you?
064.045 --In what way? you ask? we leave each other at the bridge over the Var, you tell me that you are going to travel to Piedmont and Tuscany, and not at all, you come to Paris.
064.046 --What does that mean to you?
064.047 -- Nothing; on the contrary, I even hope it will help me.
064.048 --Ah! ah! says Andrea, that is to say that you speculate on me.
064.049 --Come on! here are the big words that arrive.
064.050 --It is that you would be wrong, Master Caderousse, I warn you.
064.051 -- Oh, my God! don't get angry, little one; you must know what misfortune is; well, misfortune makes one jealous. I think you are running around Piedmont and Tuscany, obliged to make yourself a _faccino_ or _cicerone_; I pity you from the bottom of my heart, as I would pity my child. You know that I have always called you my child.
064.052 --After? after?
064.053 --Patience then, saltpetre!
064.054 --I have patience; let's see, finish. And I see you suddenly pass by the barrier des Bons-Hommes with a groom, with a tilbury, with brand new clothes. Ah, but you have discovered a mine, or bought a stockbroker's office?
064.055 --So that, as you admit, you are jealous?
064.056 -- No, I am happy, so happy, that I wanted to pay you my compliments, little one! but, as I was not dressed regularly, I took precautions not to compromise you.
064.057 --Beautiful precautions! says Andrea, you approach me in front of my servant.
064.058 -- What do you want, my child! I approach you when I can seize you. You have a very lively horse, a very light tilbury; you are naturally slippery as an eel; if I had missed you this evening, I would run the risk of not reaching you.
064.059 --You can see that I am not hiding.
064.060 --You are very happy, and I would like to say the same; I am hiding: not to mention that I was afraid you wouldn't recognize me; but you did recognize me, Caderousse added with his evil smile; come on, you are very kind.
064.061 -- Let us see, said Andrea, what do you need?
064.062 --You don't talk to me anymore, it's bad, Benedetto, an old comrade; be careful, you are going to make me demanding."
064.063 This threat made the young man's anger fall: the wind of constraint had just blown over him. He put his horse back into the trot.
064.064 "It is wrong of you, Caderousse," he said, "to do so to an old comrade, as you said just now; you are a Marseillais, I am....
064.065 --Do you know what you are now?
064.066 --No, but I was raised in Corsica; you are old and stubborn; I am young and stubborn. Between people like us, threats are bad, and everything must be done amicably. Is it my fault if luck, which continues to be bad for you, is good for me on the contrary?
064.067 --So it is good luck? so it is not a borrowed groom, so it is not a borrowed tilbury, so it is not borrowed clothes that we have here? Well, so much the better!" said Caderousse with eyes shining with covetousness.
064.068 --Oh! you see it well and you know it well, since you approach me, said Andrea becoming more and more animated. If I had a handkerchief like yours on my head, a dirty burgundy on my shoulders and shoes pierced on my feet, you would not recognize me.
064.069 -You see that you despise me, little one, and you are wrong; now that I have found you, there is nothing to prevent me from being dressed like another, since I know you to be kind-hearted: if you have two clothes, you will give me one; I used to give you my portion of soup and beans when you were too hungry.
064.070 --That's true, said Andrea.
064.071 --What an appetite you had! Do you still have a good appetite?
064.072 --But yes, says Andrea laughing.
064.073 --How you must have dined at this prince's house from which you came.
064.074 --He is not a prince, but simply a count.
064.075 --A count? and a rich one, eh?
064.076 --Yes, but don't trust him; he's a gentleman who doesn't look very comfortable.
064.077 --Oh, my God! We have no plans for your count, and we will leave him to you alone. But," added Caderousse, taking up that evil smile which had already touched his lips, "you must give something for it, you understand.
064.078 -- Well, what do you need?
064.079 --I think that with a hundred francs a month ....
064.080 --Well?
064.081 --I would live....
064.082 --With a hundred francs?
064.083 --But badly, you understand well; but with....
064.084 --With?
064.085 --Hundred and fifty francs, I would be very happy.
064.086 --Here are two hundred," said Andrea.
064.087 And he put in the hand of Caderousse ten gold louis.
064.088 "Good," said Caderousse.
064.089 --Present yourself at the concierge's every first of the month and you will find as much.
064.090 --Come on! There you go again, humiliating me!
064.091 --How's that?
064.092 --You're putting me in touch with knaves, no, you see, I only want to deal with you.
064.093 -- Well, then, ask me, and every first of the month, at least as long as I receive my pension, you will receive yours.
064.094 -- Come, come! I see that I was not mistaken, you are a good boy, and it is a blessing when happiness comes to people like you. Let's see, tell me your good luck.
064.095 -- What do you need to know about that?
064.096 --Good! More mistrust!
064.097 -- No. Well, I found my father.
064.098 --A real father?
064.099 --Lady! as long as he pays....
064.100 --You will believe and honor; that's right. What do you call him your father?
064.101 --Major Cavalcanti.
064.102 --And he is content with you?
064.103 -- So far it seems that I am enough for him.
064.104 --And who made you find this father?
064.105 -- The Count of Monte Cristo.
064.106 --The one from whom you are going out?
064.107 --Yes.
064.108 --Say, try to place me with him as a grandparent, since he keeps the office.
064.109 --Sure, I'll tell him about you; but in the meantime what are you going to do?
064.110 --Me?
064.111 --Yes, you.
064.112 --You are very good to take care of that, said Caderousse.
064.113 --It seems to me, since you take an interest in me," Andrea continued, "that I can in turn take some information.
064.114 --That's right... I'm going to rent a room in an honest house, put on a decent suit, have a shave every day, and go to the café to read the newspapers. In the evening I'll go into some show with a cheerleader, I'll look like a retired baker, that's my dream.
064.115 --Come on, it's good! If you want to carry out this project and be good, everything will be fine.
064.116 -- You see, Mr. Bossuet, and you, what are you going to become?
064.117 -- Eh! eh! says Andrea, who knows?
064.118 --Major Cavalcanti is perhaps... but unfortunately heredity is abolished.
064.119 --No politics, Caderousse!... And now that you have what you want and we have arrived, jump out of my car and disappear.
064.120 --No, dear friend!
064.121 --How, not?
064.122 --But think of it, little one, a red handkerchief on my head, almost no shoes, no paper at all, and ten gold napoleons in my pocket, not counting what was already there, which makes just two hundred francs; but I would inevitably be stopped at the gate! Then I would be forced, to justify myself, to say that it was you who gave me these ten napoleons: from there information, investigation; one learns that I left Toulon without giving leave, and one leads me from brigade to brigade until the edge of the Mediterranean. I become purely and simply the n°106, and goodbye my dream to look like a retired baker! Not so, my son; I prefer to remain honorably in the capital."
064.123 Andrea frowned; it was, as he had boasted himself, a pretty bad head that the putative son of Mr. Major Cavalcanti. He paused for a moment, glanced quickly around, and as his gaze completed the investigative circle, his hand descended innocently into his gusset, where it began to caress the trigger guard of a pocket pistol.
064.124 But during this time, Caderousse, who did not lose sight of his companion, passed his hands behind his back, and opened very gently a long Spanish knife which he carried on him at all events.
064.125 The two friends, as one sees, were worthy of understanding each other, and understood each other; Andrea's hand came out of his pocket harmlessly, and went up to his red moustache, which it caressed for some time.
064.126 "Good Caderousse," he said, "are you going to be happy?
064.127 --I will do everything I can, answered the innkeeper of the Pont du Gard, tucking his knife into his sleeve.
064.128 -- Let's go back to Paris. But how are you going to get through the barrier without arousing suspicion? It seems to me that with your costume you risk even more in a car than on foot.
064.129 -Wait, said Caderousse, you will see."
064.130 He took Andrea's hat, the large-collared hooptie which the exiled bellboy of the tilbury had left in its place, and put it on his back, after which he assumed the scowling pose of a servant of a good house whose master drives himself.
064.131 "And I," said Andrea, "am going to remain naked?
064.132 --Peuh! said Caderousse, it is so windy that the wind may well have taken your hat off.
064.133 --Let's go then, said Andrea, and get it over with.
064.134 --Who is stopping you? said Caderousse, it's not me, I hope?
064.135 --Hush!" said Cavalcanti.
064.136 The barrier was crossed without accident.
064.137 At the first cross street, Andrea stopped his horse, and Caderousse jumped to the ground.
064.138 "Well," said Andrea, "and my servant's coat, and my hat?
064.139 --Ah! answered Caderousse, you would not want me to risk catching a cold?
064.140 --But me?
064.141 --You are young, while I am getting old; good-bye, Benedetto!
064.142 And he sank into the alley, where he disappeared.
064.143 "Alas!" said Andrea with a sigh, "one cannot be completely happy in this world!"
065.000 Marital scene.
065.001 At the Place Louis XV, the three young people had separated, that is, Morrel had taken the boulevards, Château-Renaud had taken the Pont de la Révolution, and Debray had followed the quai.
065.002 Morrel and Château-Renaud, in all probability, went to their domestic homes, as is still said in the gallery of the Chamber in well-made speeches, and at the theater of the rue Richelieu, in well-written plays; but it was not the same for Debray. When he arrived at the Louvre, he made a left turn, crossed the Carrousel at a high trot, took the Rue Saint-Roch, emerged through the Rue de la Michodière, and arrived at the door of M. Danglars, just as M. de Villefort's landau, after having dropped him and his wife off at the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, stopped to take the baroness home.
065.003 Debray, a familiar man in the house, entered the courtyard first, threw the bridle into the hands of a footman, and then returned to the door to receive Mme Danglars, to whom he offered his arm to return to her apartments.
065.004 Once the door was closed and the baroness and Debray in the courtyard:
065.005 "What is the matter with you, Hermine?" said Debray, "and why did you find yourself ill at ease with this story, or rather with this fable that the Count told?
065.006 --Because I was horribly disposed this evening, my friend," replied the baroness.
065.007 -But no, Hermine," continued Debray, "you will not make me believe that. You were on the contrary in excellent spirits when you arrived at the count's house. I am sure that you are not the only one who has been in a bad mood, but I know what you are doing with his bad mood. Someone has done something to you. Tell me about it, you know I will never suffer an impertinence to be done to you.
065.008 --You are mistaken, Lucien, I assure you," resumed Mme. Danglars, "and things are as I told you, plus the bad temper of which you became aware, and of which I did not think it worth while to tell you."
065.009 It was evident that Mme. Danglars was under the influence of one of those nervous irritations of which women often cannot realize themselves, or that, as Debray guessed, she had experienced some hidden concussion which she did not wish to confess to anyone. As a man accustomed to recognizing vapors as one of the elements of feminine life, he did not insist further, waiting for the opportune moment, either of a new interrogation or of a confession _proprio motu_.
065.010 At the door of her room the baroness met Miss Cornelia. Miss Cornelia was the Baroness's trusted chambermaid.
065.011 "What is my daughter doing?" asked Madame Danglars.
065.012 --She has been studying all evening," replied Mlle. Cornélie, "and then she went to bed.
065.013 --It seems to me, however, that I can hear her piano?
065.014 --That's Miss Louise d'Armilly making music while mademoiselle is in bed.
065.015 --Good, said Madame Danglars; come and undress me."
065.016 They entered the bedroom. Debray stretched out on a large sofa, and Mme. Danglars passed into her dressing room with Mlle. Cornélie.
065.017 "My dear Monsieur Lucien," said Mme. Danglars through the cabinet door, "do you still complain that Eugenie does not do you the honor of speaking to you?
065.018 --Madame," said Lucien, playing with the baroness's little dog, who, recognizing his status as a friend of the house, was in the habit of petting him a thousand times, "I am not the only one to make such recriminations, and I think I heard Morcerf complain to you the other day that he could not get a single word out of his fiancée.
065.019 --That is true, said Mme. Danglars; but I believe that one of these mornings all this will change, and that you will see Eugenie enter your cabinet.
065.020 -In my office?
065.021 --That is, in the minister's.
065.022 --And why is that?
065.023 --To ask you for an engagement at the Opera! In truth, I have never seen such an infatuation for music: it is ridiculous for a person of the world!"
065.024 Debray smiled.
065.025 "Well," he said, "let her come with the baron's consent and yours, we will make her this engagement, and we will try to make it according to her merit, though we are very poor to pay for such a fine talent as hers.
065.026 - "Go, Cornelius," said Madame Danglars, "I have no further need of you."
065.027 Cornelie disappeared, and a moment later Mme. Danglars came out of her cabinet in a charming negligee, and came to sit by Lucien.
065.028 Then, dreamily, she began to caress the little spaniel.
065.029 Lucien looked at her for a moment in silence.
065.030 "Let's see, Hermine," he said after a moment, "answer frankly: something hurts you, doesn't it?
065.031 -Nothing," said the baroness.
065.032 And yet, as she was suffocating, she got up, tried to breathe and went to look at herself in a mirror.
065.033 "I look like hell tonight," she said.
065.034 Debray was getting up with a smile to go and reassure the baroness on this last point, when suddenly the door opened.
065.035 M. Danglars appeared; Debray sat down again.
065.036 At the sound of the door, Mrs. Danglars turned and looked at her husband with an astonishment she did not even bother to conceal.
065.037 "Good evening, madame," said the banker; "good evening, Monsieur Debray."
065.038 The baroness doubtless thought that this unexpected visit meant something, like a desire to make amends for the bitter words that had escaped the baron during the day.
065.039 She put on a dignified air, and turning to Lucien, without answering her husband, said
065.040 "Read me something, Monsieur Debray," she said to him.
065.041 Debray, whom this visit had worried slightly at first, recovered from the baroness's calm, and stretched out his hand toward a book marked in the middle by a knife with a mother-of-pearl blade inlaid with gold.
065.042 "Pardon," said the banker, "but you will tire yourself out, Baroness, by staying up so late; it is eleven o'clock, and Mr. Debray remains far away."
065.043 Debray remained seized with stupor, not that Danglars' tone was not perfectly calm and polite; but finally, through this calmness and politeness he perceived a certain unaccustomed velleity to do anything else that evening than the will of his wife.
065.044 The baroness was also surprised and showed her astonishment with a look that would undoubtedly have given her husband pause for thought, if her husband had not had his eyes fixed on a newspaper, where he was looking for the closing of the annuity.
065.045 The result was that this proud look was thrown in vain, and completely missed its effect.
065.046 "Mr. Lucien," said the baroness, "I declare to you that I do not have the slightest desire to sleep, that I have a thousand things to tell you tonight, and that you are going to spend the night listening to me, even if you sleep standing up.
065.047 -- At your orders, madam," said Lucien phlegmatically.
065.048 --Mon cher monsieur Debray, said the banker in his turn, do not kill yourself, I pray you, listening to the follies of Mme. Danglars to-night, for you will listen to them as well to-morrow; but this evening is mine, I reserve it for myself, and I shall devote it, if you will permit it, to discussing grave interests with my wife."
065.049 This time the blow was so direct and fell so plumb, that it stunned Lucien and the baroness; both questioned each other with their eyes as if to draw help from each other against this aggression; but the irresistible power of the master of the house triumphed, and force remained with the husband.
065.050 "Do not think that I am driving you away, my dear Debray," continued Danglars; "no, not in the least: an unforeseen circumstance forces me to desire to have a conversation with the baroness this very evening; this happens to me rarely enough for me not to be held in grudge."
065.051 Debray stammered a few words, saluted, and went out, bumping into the corners, like Nathan in _Athalie_.
065.052 "It is incredible," he said, when the door was closed behind him, "how easily these husbands, whom we nevertheless find so ridiculous, take advantage of us!"
065.053 Lucien left, Danglars settled himself in his place on the sofa, closed the book that had remained open, and, assuming a horribly pretentious pose, continued to play with the dog. But as the dog, who did not have the same sympathy for him as for Debray, wanted to bite him, he took him by the scruff of the neck and sent him, on the other side of the room, to a chaise longue.
065.054 The animal threw a cry as it crossed the space; but, having arrived at its destination, it crouched behind a cushion, and, stunned by this treatment to which it was not accustomed, it remained mute and without movement.
065.055 "Do you know, sir," said the baroness without batting an eyelid, "that you are making progress? Ordinarily you were only rude; this evening you are brutal.
065.056 - "It is that I am this evening in a worse mood than usual," replied Danglars.
065.057 Hermine looked at the banker with supreme disdain. Ordinarily these manners of glance exasperated the proud Danglars; but this evening he seemed hardly to pay attention to them.
065.058 "And what does your bad temper do to me?" replied the baroness, irritated at her husband's impassivity, "do these things concern me? Lock up your bad moods at home, or consign them to your offices; and since you have clerks whom you pay, pass on your bad moods to them!
065.059 --No, replied Danglars; you are mistaken in your advice, madam, so I will not follow it. My offices are my Pactole, as I believe M. Desmoutiers says, and I do not want to torment its course and disturb its calm. My clerks are honest people, who earn my fortune and whom I pay an infinitely lower rate than they deserve, if I value them according to what they bring in; I will not therefore be angry with them; those against whom I will be angry are the people who eat my dinners, who break my horses and who ruin my coffers.
065.060 --And who are these people who are ruining your coffers? Explain yourself more clearly, sir, please.
065.061 --Oh, rest assured, if I speak in riddles, I do not intend to make you look for the word for a long time," continued Danglars. The people who ruin my cash register are those who get five hundred thousand francs out of it in an hour.
065.062 --I don't understand you, sir," said the baroness, trying to conceal both the emotion in her voice and the redness of her face.
065.063 --You understand, on the contrary, very well, said Danglars, but if your ill will continues, I will tell you that I have just lost seven hundred thousand francs on the Spanish loan.
065.064 --Ah! for example, said the baroness, sneering; and it is I whom you make responsible for this loss?
065.065 --Why not?
065.066 --It is my fault that you lost seven hundred thousand francs?
065.067 -- In any case, it's not mine.
065.068 --Once and for all, sir," resumed the baroness bitterly, "I told you never to speak to me in cash; it is a language I learned neither from my parents nor in the house of my first husband.
065.069 --I believe it parbleu bien, said Danglars, neither of them had the money.
065.070 -- All the more reason for me not to have learned from them the slang of the bank, which tears my ears here from morning to night; this noise of money being counted and recounted is odious to me, and I only know the sound of your voice to be even more unpleasant.
065.071 -- Truly, said Danglars, how strange! and I had believed that you took the greatest interest in my operations!
065.072 --Me! And who could have made you believe such foolishness?
065.073 --Yourself.
065.074 --Ah! for example!
065.075 --Surely.
065.076 --I would like you to tell me on what occasion.
065.077 --Oh, my God! that's easy. Last February, you were the first to speak to me about the Haitian funds, and you dreamed that a ship was entering the port of Le Havre, and that this ship was bringing the news that a payment that was thought to be postponed until the Greek calendar was about to be made. I know the lucidity of your sleep; I therefore had all the coupons I could find of the Haitian debt bought under my hand, and I earned four hundred thousand francs, of which one hundred thousand were religiously given to you. You did what you wanted with it, it is none of my business.
065.078 "In March, it was about a railroad concession. Three companies presented themselves, offering equal guarantees. You told me that your instinct, and, although you claim to be a stranger to speculation, I believe that your instinct is very well developed in certain matters, you told me that your instinct led you to believe that the privilege would be given to the company known as the Société du Midi.
065.079 "I have registered at this very moment for two thirds of the shares of this company. The privilege was, indeed, granted to it; as you had foreseen, the shares tripled in value, and I cashed in a million, on which two hundred and fifty thousand francs were given to you as pins. How did you use these two hundred and fifty thousand francs?
065.080 --But what are you getting at, sir?" cried the baroness, shivering with spite and impatience.
065.081 --Patience, madam, I'm getting there.
065.082 --That's fortunate!
065.083 -- In April, you went to dinner at the minister's house; we talked about Spain, and you overheard a secret conversation; it was about the expulsion of Don Carlos; I bought Spanish funds. The expulsion took place, and I gained six hundred thousand francs the day that Charles V crossed the Bidasoa again. Of these six hundred thousand francs, you received fifty thousand ecus; they were yours, you disposed of them as you pleased, and I do not ask you to account for them; but it is no less true that you received five hundred thousand pounds this year.
065.084 --Well, then, sir?
065.085 --Ah, yes, after! Well, it's precisely after that that the thing spoils.
065.086 --You have ways of saying... in truth....
065.087 --They make my idea, that's all I need.... Afterwards, it was three days ago, that afterwards. Three days ago, then, you spoke politics with Mr. Debray, and you believe to see in his words that Don Carlos has returned to Spain; then I sell my annuity, the news spreads, there is panic, I do not sell any more, I give; the next day, it turns out that the news was false, and that with this false news I lost seven hundred thousand francs!
065.088 --Well?
065.089 -- Well, since I give you a quarter when I win, it is therefore a quarter that you owe me when I lose; the quarter of seven hundred thousand francs is one hundred and seventy-five thousand francs.
065.090 --But what you are telling me here is extravagant, and I don't see, in truth, how you can involve M. Debray's name in this whole story.
065.091 --Because if you don't happen to have the one hundred and seventy-five thousand francs I'm asking for, you'll borrow them from your friends, and Mr. Debray is one of your friends.
065.092 --Fi donc!" cried the baroness.
065.093 --Oh! no gestures, no cries, no modern drama, madam, otherwise you would force me to tell you that I see from here M. Debray sneering at the five hundred thousand pounds you counted him this year, and telling himself that he has at last found what the most skilful gamblers have never been able to discover, that is, a roulette wheel where one wins without putting in the game, and where one doesn't lose when one loses."
065.094 The baroness wanted to burst out.
065.095 "Wretch!" she said, "would you dare to say that you did not know what you dare to reproach me with today?
065.096 --I don't say that I knew, I don't say that I didn't know, I say to you: observe my conduct since you are no longer my wife and I am no longer your husband, you will see if it has always been consistent with itself. Some time before we broke up, you wanted to study music with that famous baritone who debuted with such success at the Théâtre-Italien; I wanted to study dance with that dancer who had made such a great reputation for herself in London. That cost me, as much for you as for me, about one hundred thousand francs. I didn't say anything, because harmony is needed in a household. One hundred thousand francs for a man and a woman to know dance and music thoroughly, that is not too expensive. Soon, you get disgusted with singing, and the idea comes to you to study diplomacy with a secretary of the minister; I let you study. You understand: what does it matter to me, since you pay for the lessons you take out of your own pocket? But, today, I realize that you draw on mine, and that your training can cost me seven hundred thousand francs per month. Stop there! Madam, because it can't go on like this. Either the diplomat will give lessons... free of charge, and I will tolerate him, or he will not set foot in my house again; do you hear, madam?
065.097 --Oh, that's too strong, sir!" cried Hermine, suffocated, "and you're going beyond the bounds of despicable.
065.098 --But, said Danglars, I see with pleasure that you have not fallen short, and that you have voluntarily obeyed this axiom of the code: "The wife must follow her husband."
065.099 --Insults!
065.100 --You are right: let us stop our facts, and reason coldly. I have never interfered in your affairs except for your own good; do the same. You say that my fund does not concern you? So be it; operate on yours, but do not fill or empty mine. Besides, who knows if all this is not a political coup de Jarnac; if the minister, furious to see me in the opposition, and jealous of the popular sympathies I arouse, does not agree with M. Debray to ruin me?
065.101 --As is probable!
065.102 --But no doubt; who has ever seen that... a false telegraphic news, that is to say the impossible, or almost; completely different signs given by the two telegraphs!... It was done on purpose for me, in truth.
065.103 "Sir," said the baroness humbly, "you are not unaware, it seems to me, that this clerk has been chased away, that there was even talk of putting him on trial, that the order had been given to arrest him, and that this order would have been carried out if he had not evaded the first search by an escape which proves his madness or his guilt. This is a mistake.
065.104 -- Yes, which makes the fools laugh, which makes the minister spend a bad night, which makes the secretaries of state blacken their paper, but which costs me seven hundred thousand francs.
065.105 - "But, sir," said Hermine suddenly, "since all this, according to you, comes from M. Debray, why, instead of saying all this directly to M. Debray, do you come to tell it to me? Why do you accuse the man and attack the woman?
065.106 --Do I know M. Debray?" said Danglars; "do I want to know him? do I want to know that he gives advice? do I want to follow it? do I play? No, it is you who are doing all that, and not I!
065.107 --But it seems to me that since you are taking advantage of it ...."
065.108 Danglars shrugged his shoulders.
065.109 "Crazy creatures, really, these women who believe themselves to be geniuses because they have conducted one or ten intrigues in such a way as not to be displayed all over Paris! But think about it: if you had hidden your misdemeanors from your husband, which is the ABC of the art, because most of the time husbands don't want to see, you would only be a pale copy of what half of your friends, the women of the world, do. But it is not so for me; I have seen and always seen; for sixteen years or so, you have hidden from me a thought perhaps, but not a step, not an action, not a fault. While you, for your part, applauded your skill and firmly believed that you were deceiving me: what has resulted from this? It is that, thanks to my alleged ignorance, from M. de Villefort to M. Debray, there is not one of your friends who has not trembled before me. There is not one of them who has not treated me as master of the house, my only claim on you; there is not one, finally, who has dared to tell you about me what I tell you about myself today. I allow you to make me odious, but I will prevent you from making me ridiculous, and above all I forbid you positively and, above all, to ruin me."
065.110 Up to the moment when Villefort's name had been uttered, the baroness had put on a fairly good show; but at this name she had paled, and rising as if moved by a spring, she had stretched out her arms as if to ward off an apparition, and taken three steps towards her husband as if to wring from him the end of the secret which he did not know, or which perhaps, by some odious calculation as were almost all Danglars's calculations, he did not wish to let slip out entirely.
065.111 "M. de Villefort! What does that mean! What do you mean?
065.112 --That means, madame, that M. de Nargonne, your first husband, being neither a philosopher nor a banker, or perhaps being both, and seeing that there was no advantage to be had from a royal prosecutor, died of grief or anger at having found you six months pregnant after an absence of nine. I am brutal, not only I know it, but I brag about it: it is one of my means of success in my commercial operations. Why, instead of killing, did he have himself killed? Because he had no cash to save. But I owe my cash to myself. Mr. Debray, my partner, makes me lose seven hundred thousand francs, let him bear his share of the loss, and we will continue our business; otherwise, let him bankrupt me of these one hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds, and let him do what bankers do, let him disappear. Eh, my God! he is a charming boy, I know, when his news is accurate; but when it is not, there are fifty in the world who are better than he is."
065.113 Mme. Danglars was appalled; yet she made a supreme effort to answer this last attack. She fell into an armchair, thinking of Villefort, of the scene at dinner, of that strange series of misfortunes which for some days had been falling one by one upon her house and changing into scandalous debates the wadded-up calm of her household. Danglars did not even look at her, though she did her best to faint. He pulled the door of the bedroom without adding a single word and went home; so that Mrs. Danglars, coming back from her half-faint, could believe that she had had a bad dream.
066.000 Marriage plans.
066.001 The day after this scene, at the hour that Debray was accustomed to choose to come to make, on his way to his office, a small visit to Mrs. Danglars, his coupe did not appear in the court.
066.002 At that hour, that is, about half past noon, Mrs. Danglars asked for her car and left.
066.003 Danglars, placed behind a curtain, had watched for this exit that he was waiting for. He gave orders to be informed as soon as Madame Danglars appeared; but at two o'clock she had not returned.
066.004 At two o'clock he asked for his horses, went to the House and registered to speak against the budget.
066.005 From noon to two o'clock, Danglars had remained in his office, unpacking his dispatches, growing darker and darker, piling up figure after figure, and receiving, among other visits, that of Major Cavalcanti, who, as blue, as stiff, and as exact as ever, showed up at the time announced the day before to finish his business with the banker.
066.006 On leaving the Chamber, Danglars, who had given violent signs of agitation during the session and who had been more acerbic than ever against the ministry, got back into his carriage and ordered the coachman to take him to Avenue des Champs-Élysées, No. 30.
066.007 Monte-Cristo was at home; only he was with someone, and he asked Danglars to wait a moment in the living room.
066.008 While the banker was waiting, the door opened, and he saw a man dressed as an abbot enter, who, instead of waiting like him, more familiar than he was in the house, greeted him, entered the apartments and disappeared.
066.009 A moment later, the door by which the priest had entered reopened, and Monte Cristo appeared.
066.010 "Pardon me," he said, "dear Baron, but a good friend of mine, the Abbé Busoni, whom you may have seen passing by, has just arrived in Paris; we had been separated for a long time, and I did not have the courage to leave him at once. I hope that in favor of the reason you will excuse me for having kept you waiting.
066.011 --How then, said Danglars, it is quite simple; it is I who have taken my moment badly, and I am going to withdraw.
066.012 --Not at all; on the contrary, sit down. But, for God's sake, what's the matter with you? You look all worried; in truth you frighten me. A grieving capitalist is like a comet; he always presages some great misfortune in the world.
066.013 --I have, my dear sir," said Danglars, "that bad luck has been upon me for several days, and that I only learn of disasters.
066.014 --Ah! my God!" said Monte Cristo, "have you had a relapse on the stock exchange?
066.015 -- No, I am cured of it, for a few days at least; it is simply a question of a bankruptcy in Trieste for me.
066.016 --Really? Is your bankrupt by any chance Jacopo Manfredi?
066.017 -- Just so! Imagine a man who has been doing business with me for I don't know how long, for eight or nine hundred thousand francs a year. Never a misunderstanding, never a delay; a man who paid like a prince... who pays. I put myself in advance of a million with him, and isn't it my devil of a Jacopo Manfredi who suspends his payments!
066.018 --In truth?
066.019 --It is an unheard-of fate. I draw on him six hundred thousand pounds, which are unpaid to me, and moreover I am still the bearer of four hundred thousand francs of bills of exchange signed by him and payable at the end of the current year at his correspondent in Paris. It is the 30th, I send to touch; ah! well yes, the correspondent disappeared. With my business in Spain, that makes a nice end of the month.
066.020 --But is it really a loss, your Spanish business?
066.021 --Certainly, seven hundred thousand francs out of my till, just that.
066.022 --How on earth did you go to such a school, you old wolf-hound?
066.023 --Eh! it's my wife's fault. She dreamed that Don Carlos had returned to Spain; she believes in dreams. It is magnetism, she says, and when she dreams a thing, that thing, she assures us, must infallibly happen. On her conviction, I allow her to play: she has her cassette and her stockbroker: she plays and she loses. It is true that it is not my money, but hers that she is playing with. However, you will understand that when seven hundred thousand francs come out of the wife's pocket, the husband always notices a little. How! You didn't know that? But the thing made an enormous noise.
066.024 -- Yes, I had heard about it, but I didn't know the details; then I am as ignorant as can be of all these stock market affairs.
066.025 -- So you don't play?
066.026 --Me! And how do you want me to play? I, who already have so much difficulty in regulating my income, would be forced, besides my steward, to take on yet another clerk and a cashier. But, speaking of Spain, it seems to me that the baroness had not quite dreamed the story of Don Carlos' return. Didn't the newspapers say something about it?
066.027 -- Do you believe in newspapers?
066.028 --Myself, not in the least; but it seems to me that this honest _Messenger_ was an exception to the rule, and that it only announced certain news, telegraphic news.
066.029 --Well, here is what is inexplicable," said Danglars, "that this return of Don Carlos was indeed telegraphic news.
066.030 --So, said Monte Cristo, that it is seventeen hundred thousand francs that you are losing this month?
066.031 -- There is no approximation, it is just my figure.
066.032 --Diable! For a fortune of the third order, said Monte Cristo with compassion, it is a hard blow.
066.033 --Third-rate!" said Danglars a little humiliated; "what on earth do you mean by that?
066.034 -Without doubt, continued Monte Cristo, I make three categories in fortunes: fortune of the first order, fortune of the second order, fortune of the third order. I call fortune of the first order that which is composed of treasures that one has at hand, lands, mines, revenues on states like France, Austria, and England, provided that these treasures, these mines, these revenues, form a total of a hundred millions; I call fortune of the second order manufacturing operations, enterprises by association, viceroyalties, and principalities not exceeding fifteen hundred thousand francs in revenue, the whole forming a capital of about fifty millions; Finally, I call third-order wealth the capital that grows by compound interest, the gains that depend on the will of others or on the chances of chance, that a bankruptcy affects, that a telegraphic news shakes up; the possible speculations, the operations subject finally to the chances of this fatality that one could call minor force, by comparing it to the major force, which is the natural force; the whole forming a fictitious or real capital of about fifteen millions. Isn't that more or less your position?
066.035 --But, yes! replied Danglars.
066.036 --It follows that with six ends of the month like that, continued Monte Cristo imperturbably, a third-rate house would be in agony.
066.037 --Oh!" said Danglars with a very pale smile, "how you go!
066.038 - "Let us take seven months," replied Monte Cristo in the same tone. I am not sure that I have been able to find the right time for this, but I am sure that I have been able to find the right time for this, and I am sure that I have been able to find the right time for this. No? Well, you are right, for with such reflections one would never commit one's capital, which is to the financier what skin is to the civilized man. We have our more or less sumptuous clothes, that is our credit; but when a man dies, he has only his skin, just as when you leave business, you have only your real property, five or six millions at the most; for third-rate fortunes are hardly more than a third or a quarter of their appearance, just as the locomotive of a railroad is always, in the midst of the smoke that envelops it and magnifies it, only a more or less strong engine. Well, out of these five millions which form your real assets, you have just lost about two, which diminish your fictitious fortune or your credit by the same amount; that is to say, my dear Mr. Danglars, that your skin has just been opened by a bloodletting which, repeated four times, would result in death. Eh! eh! be careful, my dear Mr. Danglars. Do you need money? Do you want me to lend you some?
066.039 -- What a bad calculator you are!" cried Danglars, calling to his aid all the philosophy and all the dissimulation of appearance: at the present time, the money has returned to my coffers through other speculations which have succeeded. The blood that went out through bloodletting came back in through nutrition. I lost a battle in Spain, I was beaten at Trieste; but my naval army in India will have taken a few galleons; my pioneers in Mexico will have discovered some mines.
066.040 --Fine, fine! But the scar remains, and at the first loss it will reopen.
066.041 -- No, for I walk on certainties, continued Danglars with the banal facundity of the charlatan, whose state is to advocate his credit; it would be necessary to overthrow me if three governments were to fall.
066.042 --Dame! that has been seen.
066.043 --That the earth should lack harvests.
066.044 --Remember the seven fat cows and the seven thin cows.
066.045 --Or let the sea withdraw, as in the time of _Pharaoh_; still there are many seas, and the ships would be even to make themselves caravans.
066.046 - "So much the better, a thousand times the better, dear Monsieur Danglars," said Monte Cristo; "and I see that I was mistaken, and that you are returning to the fortunes of the second order.
066.047 --I think I can aspire to this honor, said Danglars with one of those stereotyped smiles which made Monte Cristo look like one of those pasty moons with which bad painters smear their ruins; but, since we are talking about business, he added, delighted to find this reason for changing the conversation, tell me what I can do for Mr. Cavalcanti.
066.048 --But, give him money, if he has a credit on you and that credit seems good to you.
066.049 --Excellent! He showed up this morning with a voucher for forty thousand francs, payable at sight to you, signed Busoni, and sent back by you to me with your endorsement. You understand that I counted his forty square bills to him at once."
066.050 Monte-Cristo nodded his head in full agreement.
066.051 "But that's not all," continued Danglars; "he has opened his son a credit with me.
066.052 --How much, without indiscretion, does he give the young man?
066.053 --Five thousand francs a month.
066.054 --Sixty thousand francs a year. I suspected as much," said Monte Cristo, shrugging his shoulders; "the Cavalcanti are cowards. What does he want a young man to do with five thousand francs a month?
066.055 --But you understand that if the young man needs a few thousand francs more....
066.056 --Don't do anything about it, the father would leave them to you for your account; you don't know all the ultramontane millionaires: they are real harpagons. And by whom is this credit opened for him?
066.057 -- Oh, by the Fenzi house, one of the best in Florence.
066.058 -- I don't want to say that you will lose, so much; but keep to the terms of the letter.
066.059 -- So you would not trust this Cavalcanti?
066.060 -- I would give him ten million on his signature. That comes under the heading of second-rate fortunes, of which I spoke to you just now, my dear Mr. Danglars.
066.061 --And with that, how simple he is! I would have taken him for a major, nothing more.
066.062 -- And you would have done him honor; for, you are right, he does not look like much. When I saw him for the first time, he gave me the impression of an old lieutenant moldy under the shoulder pad. But all Italians are like that, they look like old Jews when they don't dazzle like wise men from the East.
066.063 --The young man is better, said Danglars.
066.064 -- Yes, a little shy, perhaps; but, on the whole, he seemed suitable. I was worried about him.
066.065 --Why was that?
066.066 --Because you saw him at my house about the time he entered the world, or so I was told. He traveled with a very severe tutor and had never been to Paris.
066.067 -All these Italians of quality are in the habit of marrying each other, are they not?" asked Danglars carelessly; "they like to combine their fortunes.
066.068 -They usually do so, it is true; but Cavalcanti is an original who does nothing like the others. It will not be taken away from me that he sends his son to France to find a wife.
066.069 -- You think so?
066.070 -- I am sure of it.
066.071 --And you have heard of his fortune?
066.072 --It's all about that; only some give him millions, others claim he doesn't have a penny.
066.073 --And your own opinion?
066.074 --You mustn't base your opinion on that; it is entirely personal.
066.075 --But, finally....
066.076 --My opinion, to me, is that all these old podestates, all these old condottieri, because these Cavalcanti commanded armies, governed provinces; my opinion, I say, is that they buried millions in corners that their elders alone know and make known to their elders from generation to generation; and the proof, it is that they are all yellow and dry like their florins of the time of the Republic, of which they preserve a reflection by dint of looking at them.
066.077 --Perfect, said Danglars; and it is all the more true that one does not know an inch of land to all these people.
066.078 --Far too little, at least; I know very well that I only know Cavalcanti from his palace in Lucca.
066.079 --Ah! he has a palace! said Danglars, laughing; that is already something.
066.080 --Yes, and still he rents it to the Minister of Finance, while he lives in a small house. Oh, I've already told you, I think the man is tight.
066.081 -- Come on, come on, you're not flattering him.
066.082 -- Look, I hardly know him: I think I have seen him three times in my life. What I know of him is from the Abbé Busoni and from himself; he was speaking to me this morning about his plans for his son, and he gave me to understand that, tired of seeing his considerable funds lying dormant in Italy, which is a dead country, he would like to find a way, either in France or in England, to make his millions bear fruit. But note always that, although I have the greatest confidence in Abbé Busoni personally, I am not responsible for anything.
066.083 -- Anyway, thank you for the client you sent me; it's a very nice name to put on my books, and my cashier, to whom I explained what the Cavalcanti were, is very proud of it. By the way, and this is a simple tourist detail, when these people marry their sons, do they give them dowries?
066.084 -- Oh, my God! I knew an Italian prince, rich as a gold mine, one of the first names of Tuscany, who, when his sons married as he pleased, gave them millions, and, when they married in spite of him, was content to give them an annuity of thirty ecus a month. Let us suppose that Andrea marries according to his father's wishes, he will perhaps give her one, two, three millions. If it were with the daughter of a banker, for example, perhaps he would take an interest in the house of his son's father-in-law; then, suppose that his daughter-in-law displeases him: good evening, father Cavalcanti gets hold of the key to his safe, turns the lock twice, and there is Master Andrea obliged to live like a Parisian son of a family, by playing cards or dice
066.085 --That boy will find a Bavarian or Peruvian princess; he will want a closed crown, an Eldorado crossed by the Potose.
066.086 -- No, all these great lords on the other side of the mountains frequently marry mere mortals; they are like Jupiter, they like to cross the races. Ah, is it that you want to marry Andrea, my dear Monsieur Danglars, that you are asking me all these questions?
066.087 --My faith, said Danglars, that would not seem to me a bad speculation; and I am a speculator.
066.088 -I presume it is not with Miss Danglars? you would not have Albert slit poor Andrea's throat?
066.089 --Albert? said Danglars, shrugging his shoulders; ah! well yes, he cares quite a bit about that.
066.090 -But he is engaged to your daughter, I believe?
066.091 --That is to say, M. de Morcerf and I have sometimes discussed this marriage; but Mme. de Morcerf and Albert....
066.092 --Are you not going to tell me that this one is not a good match?
066.093 --Eh! eh! Miss Danglars is worth M. de Morcerf, it seems to me!
066.094 --Miss Danglars' dowry will be beautiful, indeed, and I have no doubt of it, especially if the telegraph does not do any more foolish things.
066.095 --Oh! it is not only the dowry. But tell me, by the way?
066.096 -- Well!
066.097 --Why did you not invite Morcerf and his family to your dinner?
066.098 --I did too, but he objected to a trip to Dieppe with Mme. de Morcerf, to whom the sea air was recommended.
066.099 --Yes, yes, said Danglars laughing, it must be good for him.
066.100 --Why is that?
066.101 --Because it is the air she breathed in her youth."
066.102 Monte Cristo let the epigram pass without seeming to pay attention to it.
066.103 "But in the end," said the Count, "if Albert is not as rich as Mlle. Danglars, you cannot deny that he bears a fine name.
066.104 --So be it, but I like mine just as much, said Danglars.
066.105 --Certainly your name is popular, and it has adorned the title with which it was thought to be adorned; but you are too intelligent a man not to have understood that, according to certain prejudices too powerfully rooted to be extirpated, nobility of five centuries is better than nobility of twenty years.
066.106 --And that is precisely why, said Danglars with a smile that he tried to make sardonic, that is why I would prefer Mr. Andrea Cavalcanti to Mr. Albert de Morcerf.
066.107 --But, however, said Monte Cristo, I suppose that the Morcerfs do not give him up to the Cavalcanti?
066.108 --The Morcerfs! I am not a man of the world," said Danglars, "but I am a man of the world," said Monte Cristo, "and I am a man of the world.
066.109 -- I believe so.
066.110 --And, moreover, a connoisseur of blazon?
066.111 -- A little.
066.112 -- Well, look at the color of mine; it is more solid than that of Morcerf's coat of arms.
066.113 --Why is that?
066.114 --Because, if I am not a baron by birth, my name is Danglars at least.
066.115 --And then?
066.116 --While his name is not Morcerf.
066.117 --What do you mean, his name is not Morcerf?
066.118 --Not in the least.
066.119 --Come on, then!
066.120 --Me, someone made me a baron, so that I am; he made himself a count, so that he is not.
066.121 -- Impossible.
066.122 --Listen, my dear Count," continued Danglars, "M. de Morcerf has been my friend, or rather my acquaintance, for thirty years; I, for my part, you know that I make good use of my coat of arms, since I have never forgotten where I started from.
066.123 --That is proof of great humility or great pride, said Monte Cristo.
066.124 -- Well, when I was a little clerk, Morcerf was a simple fisherman.
066.125 --And then he was called?
066.126 --Fernand.
066.127 --All short?
066.128 --Fernand Mondego.
066.129 --Are you sure?
066.130 --Goddamn it! He sold me enough fish for me to know him.
066.131 --So why did you give him your daughter?
066.132 --Because Fernand and Danglars, being two parvenus, both ennobled, both enriched, are basically the same, except for certain things, however, that have been said about him and that have never been said about me.
066.133 --What then?
066.134 --Nothing.
066.135 --Ah, yes, I understand; what you are telling me here refreshes my memory about the name of Fernand Mondego; I heard that name pronounced in Greece.
066.136 -- About the affair of Ali-Pacha?
066.137 -- Just so.
066.138 --That is the mystery," continued Danglars, "and I confess that I would have given a great deal to discover it.
066.139 --It was not difficult, if you had wanted it very much.
066.140 --How so?
066.141 --Surely you have some correspondent in Greece?
066.142 --Goodbye!
066.143 --In Janina?
066.144 --I have them everywhere....
066.145 -- Well, write to your correspondent in Janina, and ask him what role a Frenchman named Fernand played in the Ali-Tebelin catastrophe.
066.146 --You are right!" exclaimed Danglars, rising to his feet, "I will write this very day!
066.147 --Do it.
066.148 --I will do it.
066.149 --And if you have any scandalous news....
066.150 -- I will communicate it to you.
066.151 --You will please me."
066.152 Danglars dashed out of the apartment, and only made a leap to his car.
067.000 The office of the king's prosecutor.
067.001 Let us leave the banker to return at the great trot of his horses, and let us follow Mrs. Danglars in her morning excursion.
067.002 We have said that at half past noon Mrs. Danglars asked for her horses and went out in her carriage.
067.003 She went towards the Faubourg Saint-Germain, took the Rue Mazarine, and stopped at the Pont-Neuf crossing.
067.004 She got out and crossed the passage. She was dressed very simply, as befits a woman of taste who goes out in the morning.
067.005 In the Rue Guénégaud she got into a carriage, pointing to the Rue du Harlay as the goal of her journey.
067.006 As soon as she was in the carriage, she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil, which she tied over her straw hat; then she put her hat back on her head, and saw with pleasure, looking in a small pocket mirror, that one could see of her only her white skin and the sparkling apple of her eye.
067.007 The carriage took the Pont-Neuf, and entered, by the Place Dauphine, the courtyard of the Harlay; it was paid for by opening the door, and Mme. Danglars rushed towards the staircase, which she crossed lightly, and soon arrived at the Salle des Pas-Perdus.
067.008 In the morning there is a lot of business and even more busy people at the Palais; busy people don't look much at women; so Mrs. Danglars passed through the Salle des Pas-Perdus without being noticed more than ten other women who were watching for their lawyer.
067.009 The antechamber of M. de Villefort was crowded; but Mme. Danglars did not even need to pronounce her name, as soon as she appeared, a bailiff got up, came to her, asked her if she was not the person to whom the King's prosecutor had given an appointment, and, on her affirmative answer, he led her through a reserved corridor to M. de Villefort's office.
067.010 The magistrate was writing, seated in his armchair, with his back to the door: he heard the door open, the bailiff pronounce these words: "Come in, madam!" and the door close again, without making a single movement; but no sooner had he felt the bailiff's footsteps fading away, than he turned round briskly, went to push the bolts, draw the curtains and visit every corner of the cabinet.
067.011 Then, when he was certain that he could neither be seen nor heard, and that he was therefore tranquilized, he said
067.012 "Thank you, madam," he said, "thank you for your accuracy."
067.013 And he offered her a seat, which Mme. Danglars accepted, for her heart was beating so strongly that she felt close to suffocation.
067.014 "There," said the king's prosecutor, taking his seat in turn and making his chair describe a semicircle so as to be in front of Mrs. Danglars, "it is a long time, madam, since I have had the happiness of talking alone with you; and, to my great regret, we find ourselves again to begin a very painful conversation.
067.015 --Though, sir, you see that I came to your first call, though certainly this conversation is even more painful for me than for you."
067.016 Villefort smiled bitterly.
067.017 "So it is true," he said, responding to his own thought rather than to the words of Madame Danglars, "so it is true that all our actions leave their traces, some dark, some bright, in our past! It is therefore true that all our steps in this life resemble the walk of the reptile on the sand and make a furrow! Alas! for many, this furrow is that of their tears!
067.018 - "Sir," said Madame Danglars, "you understand my emotion, don't you? This room where so many guilty people have passed trembling and ashamed, this chair where I sit in my turn ashamed and trembling... Oh, look, I need all my reason not to see in me a very guilty woman and in you a threatening judge."
067.019 Villefort shook his head and sighed.
067.020 "And I," he continued, "and I tell myself that my place is not in the judge's chair, but on the accused's bench.
067.021 --You?" said Mrs. Danglars, astonished.
067.022 -- Yes, I am.
067.023 --I believe that on your part, sir, your puritanism exaggerates the situation, said Mrs. Danglars, whose beautiful eye lit up with a fleeting glint. These furrows of which you spoke just now, were traced by all the ardent youths. In the depths of passions beyond pleasure, there is always a little remorse; that is why the Gospel, that eternal resource of the unfortunate, has given us poor women the admirable parable of the sinful daughter and the adulterous woman. I confess that when I look back on the ravings of my youth, I sometimes think that God will forgive me for them, because if not the excuse, at least the compensation has been found in my sufferings; but what do you have to fear from all this, you men whom everyone excuses and whom scandal ennobles?
067.024 --Madame, replied Villefort, you know me; I am not a hypocrite, or at least I do not act hypocritically without reason. If my forehead is severe, it is because many misfortunes have darkened it; if my heart has become petrified, it is in order to be able to bear the shocks it has received. I was not like that in my youth, I was not like that on the evening of the engagement when we were all sitting around a table in the rue du Cours in Marseille. But, since then, everything has changed in me and around me; my life has been worn out by pursuing difficult things and breaking in difficulties those who, voluntarily or involuntarily, by their free will or by chance, were placed in my path to bring these things about. It is rare that what one desires ardently is not ardently defended by those from whom one wants to obtain it or from whom one tries to wrest it. Thus, most of the evil deeds of men have come before them, disguised under the specious guise of necessity; then, the evil deed committed in a moment of exaltation, fear and delirium, one sees that one could have passed by it by avoiding it. The means which it would have been good to employ, which you did not see, blind as you were, presents itself to your eyes easy and simple; you say to yourself: How did I not do that instead of doing this? You, ladies, on the contrary, are very rarely tormented by remorse, for very rarely does the decision come from you, your misfortunes are almost always imposed on you, your faults are almost always the crime of others.
067.025 -- In any case, sir, agree," replied Mrs. Danglars, "if I have committed a fault, this fault being personal, I received yesterday the severe punishment.
067.026 --Poor woman! said Villefort, shaking her hand, too severe for your strength, for twice you have almost succumbed to it, and yet ....
067.027 --Well?
067.028 -- Well, I must tell you... gather all your courage, madam, for you are not yet at the end.
067.029 --My God!" cried Mrs. Danglars, frightened, "what is it now?
067.030 -- You see only the past, madam, and it is certainly dark. Well, imagine a still darker future, a future... dreadful certainly... bloody perhaps!..."
067.031 The baroness knew Villefort's calm; she was so appalled at his exaltation, that she opened her mouth to cry out, but the cry died in her throat.
067.032 "How did it resurrect itself, this terrible past?" cried Villefort; "how, from the depths of the grave and from the depths of our hearts where it slept, did it come out like a ghost to make our cheeks pale and our foreheads redden?
067.033 -- Alas!" said Hermine, "no doubt by chance!
067.034 --Chance!" said Villefort; "no, no, madame, there is no chance!
067.035 -But yes; is it not by chance, fatal it is true, but a chance that has done all this? Is it not by chance that the Count of Monte Cristo has bought this house? is it not by chance that he has had the earth dug up? is it not by chance, finally, that this unfortunate child has been dug up under the trees? Poor innocent creature who came out of me, to whom I could never give a kiss, but to whom I gave many tears. Ah, all my heart flew to meet the Count when he spoke of this dear corpse found under some flowers.
067.036 --Well, no, madame; and this is what I had to tell you in a terrible way, replied Villefort in a dull voice: no, there was no body found under the flowers; no, there was no child dug up; no, you must not cry; no, you must not moan: you must tremble!
067.037 --What do you mean?" cried Mme. Danglars, shivering.
067.038 -- I mean that M. Monte Cristo, digging at the foot of these trees, could find neither the skeleton of a child nor the fittings of a chest, because under these trees there was neither the one nor the other.
067.039 --There was neither one nor the other!" said Mme. Danglars again, fixing on the King's prosecutor eyes whose prism, frightfully dilated, indicated terror; "there was neither one nor the other!" she repeated again as one who tries to fix by the sound of words and the noise of the voice his ideas ready to escape him.
067.040 --No!" said Villefort, dropping his forehead in his hands, "a hundred times no!
067.041 --But it was not there that you deposited the poor child, sir? Why deceive me? For what purpose, let's see, say?
067.042 -It's there; but listen to me, listen to me, madam, and you will pity me, I who have borne the burden of pain I am going to tell you about for twenty years, without putting any of it on you.
067.043 --My God! you frighten me! but never mind, speak, I am listening.
067.044 --You know how that painful night came about, when you were dying on your bed in that red damask room, while I, almost as breathless as you, was waiting for your deliverance. The child came, was handed to me without movement, without breath, without voice: we thought him dead."
067.045 Mme. Danglars made a quick movement, as if she wanted to leap from her chair.
067.046 But Villefort stopped her by joining her hands as if to implore her attention.
067.047 "We thought he was dead," he repeated; "I put him in a chest that was to replace the coffin, went down to the garden, dug a grave and buried him in a hurry. I had hardly finished covering him with earth, when the arm of the Corsican extended towards me. I saw like a shadow rising, like a lightning flashing. I felt a pain, I wanted to shout, an icy shiver ran through my whole body and embraced me at the throat .... I fell dying, and I thought I was killed. I will never forget your sublime courage, when, returned to me, I dragged myself expiring until the bottom of the staircase, where, expiring yourself, you came to meet me. It was necessary to keep silence on the terrible catastrophe; you had the courage to return to your house, supported by your nurse; a duel was the pretext of my wound. Against all expectations, the secret was kept from both of us, I was transported to Versailles; for three months, I struggled against death; finally as I seemed to be coming back to life, I was ordered to the sun and the air of the South. Four men carried me from Paris to Châlons, making six leagues a day. Mme de Villefort followed the stretcher in her carriage. At Châlons, they put me on the Saône, then I crossed the Rhône, and, by the speed of the current alone, I went down to Arles, then from Arles, I took my litter and continued my way to Marseille. My convalescence lasted six months; I didn't hear about you anymore, I didn't dare to ask what had become of you. When I returned to Paris, I learned that you, the widow of M. de Nargonne, had married M. Danglars.
067.048 "What had I been thinking about since the knowledge came back to me? Always the same thing, always this child's corpse which, every night, in my dreams, flew out of the earth and hovered over the pit, threatening me with its gaze and its gesture. So, as soon as I got back to Paris, I asked around; the house had not been lived in since we had left it, but it had just been rented for nine years. I went to find the tenant, I pretended to have a great desire not to see passing in foreign hands this house which belonged to the father and the mother of my wife; I offered a compensation so that one breaks the lease; I was asked six thousand francs: I would have given ten thousand, I would have given twenty thousand. I had them on me, I made, as soon as possible, to sign the cancellation; then, when I held this so much desired transfer, I left to the gallop for Auteuil. Nobody, since I had left, had entered the house.
067.049 "It was five o'clock in the afternoon, I went up to the red room and waited for the night.
067.050 "There, all that I had been saying to myself for a year in my continual agony came to my mind, much more threatening than ever.
067.051 "This Corsican who had declared my vendetta, who had followed me from Nîmes to Paris; this Corsican, who was hidden in the garden, who had hit me, had seen me dig the grave, he had seen me bury the child; he could come to know you; perhaps he knew you.... Wouldn't he make you pay one day for the secret of this terrible affair? Wouldn't it be a sweet revenge for him, when he would learn that I had not died from his stabbing? It was therefore urgent that before anything else, and at any risk, I should make the traces of this past disappear, that I should destroy all material vestige of it; there would always be only too much reality in my memory.
067.052 "That was why I had cancelled the lease, that was why I had come, that was why I was waiting.
067.053 "The night arrived, I let it thicken; I was without light in this room, where the winds made the doors tremble, behind which I always thought I saw some ambushed spy; from time to time I shuddered, it seemed to me behind me, in this bed, to hear your complaints, and I did not dare turn around. My heart was beating in the silence, and I felt it beating so violently that I thought my wound was going to reopen; finally, I heard all these various noises of the countryside fade away, one after the other. I understood that I had nothing more to fear, that I could neither be seen nor heard, and I decided to go down.
067.054 "Listen, Hermine, I believe myself to be as brave as any other man, but when I took from my breast that little key to the staircase, which we both cherished, and which you had wanted to attach to a gold ring, when I opened the door, when, through the windows, I saw a pale moon throw a long, ghostly band of white light over the spiral steps, I held on to the wall and was close to screaming; it seemed as if I were going to go mad.
067.055 "Finally, I managed to make myself master of myself. I went down the stairs step by step; the only thing I could not overcome was a strange trembling in my knees. I clung to the banister; if I had let go for a moment, I would have rushed.
067.056 "I arrived at the door below; outside this door, a spade was placed against the wall. I had brought a dull lantern with me; in the middle of the lawn I stopped to light it, and then I continued on my way.
067.057 "November was ending, all the greenery of the garden had disappeared, the trees were no more than skeletons with long gaunt arms, and the dead leaves screamed with the sand under my steps.
067.058 "Fear gripped my heart so tightly that as I approached the massif I drew a pistol from my pocket and cocked it. I always thought I saw the figure of the Corsican appear through the branches.
067.059 "I illuminated the massif with my dull lantern; it was empty. I threw the eyes all around me; I was quite alone; no noise disturbed the silence of the night, if it is not the song of an owl which threw its acute and lugubrious cry like a call to the phantoms of the night.
067.060 "I tied my lantern to a forked branch that I had already noticed a year before, in the very place where I stopped to dig the pit.
067.061 "The grass had, during the summer, grown quite thick in this place, and, when autumn came, no one had been there to mow it. However, a spot that was not so thick caught my attention; it was obvious that this was where I had turned the soil. I set to work.
067.062 "I had thus arrived at this hour that I had been waiting for more than a year!
067.063 "Also, as I hoped, as I worked, as I probed each clump of grass, believing to feel resistance at the end of my spade; nothing! and yet I made a hole twice as big as the first one. I thought I had misled myself, to have taken the wrong place; I oriented myself, I looked at the trees, I tried to recognize the details which had struck me. A cold, sharp breeze whistled through the bare branches, and yet sweat trickled down my forehead. I remembered that I had received the stab wound at the moment when I was trampling the earth to cover the pit; while trampling this earth, I was leaning on a false ebony tree; behind me was an artificial rock intended to serve as a bench for the walkers; for as I fell, my hand, which had just left the ebony tree, had felt the coolness of this stone. To my right was the false ebony tree, behind me was the rock, I fell while placing myself in the same position, I got up and began to dig and widen the hole: nothing! still nothing! the chest was not there.
067.064 --The box was not there? murmured Mrs. Danglars, suffocated with horror.
067.065 --Don't think that I confined myself to this attempt," continued Villefort; "no. I searched the whole house. I searched the whole mass of trees; I thought that the assassin, having dug up the chest and believing it to be a treasure, had wanted to seize it, had taken it away; then realizing his mistake, had in his turn made a hole and deposited it there; nothing. Then I had the idea that he had not taken so many precautions, and had simply thrown it in some corner. In this last hypothesis, it was necessary for me, to make my research, to wait for the day. I went back up to the room and waited.
067.066 --Oh! my God!
067.067 -- When daylight came, I went down again. My first visit was to the massif; I hoped to find there traces which would have escaped me during the darkness. I had turned over an area of more than twenty feet square, and to a depth of more than two feet. A day would hardly have sufficed for a hired man to do what I had done in an hour. Nothing, I saw absolutely nothing.
067.068 "Then I set out to find the chest, according to the supposition I had made that it had been thrown in some corner. It must have been on the path that led to the little exit door; but this new investigation was as useless as the first, and, with a heavy heart, I returned to the massif, which itself no longer left me any hope.
067.069 --Oh!" exclaimed Mme. Danglars, "it was enough to drive one mad.
067.070 -- I hoped for a moment, said Villefort, but I did not have that happiness; however, recalling my strength and consequently my ideas: Why would this man have taken this corpse? I asked myself.
067.071 --But you said so," said Madame Danglars, "to have proof.
067.072 -- No, madame, it could not be that; one does not keep a corpse for a year, one shows it to a magistrate, and one makes a deposition. Now, none of this had happened.
067.073 --Well, then?
067.074 --Then there is something more terrible, more fatal, more frightening for us: there is that the child was alive perhaps, and that the assassin saved him."
067.075 Mme. Danglars uttered a terrible cry, and seizing Villefort's hands
067.076 "My child was alive!" she said; "you have buried my child alive, monsieur! You were not sure that my child was dead, and you buried it! ah!"
067.077 Mme. Danglars had straightened up, and she stood before the king's prosecutor, whose wrists she clasped in her delicate hands, standing and almost threatening.
067.078 "What do I know? I am telling you this as I would tell you anything else," replied Villefort with a fixity of gaze that indicated that this man, so powerful, was close to reaching the limits of despair and madness.
067.079 "Ah, my child, my poor child!" cried the baroness, falling back into her chair and choking her sobs in her handkerchief.
067.080 Villefort came to himself, and understood that in order to divert the maternal storm which was gathering on his head, it was necessary to pass on to Mme. Danglars the terror which he himself felt.
067.081 "You understand then that if this is so," he said, rising in his turn and approaching the baroness to speak to her in a lower voice, "we are lost: this child lives, and someone knows that he lives, someone has our secret; and since Monte Cristo speaks before us of a child dug up where this child was no longer, this secret is his.
067.082 - "God, just God, avenging God!
067.083 Villefort replied only with a sort of roar.
067.084 "But this child, this child, sir?" continued the obstinate mother.
067.085 --Oh! how I have searched for him!" said Villefort, twisting his arms: "How many times I have called for him in my long sleepless nights! How many times I have longed for a royal wealth to buy a million secrets from a million men, and to find my secret in theirs! Finally, one day when for the hundredth time I took up the spade again, I asked myself for the hundredth time what the Corsican had done with the child: a child embarrasses a fugitive; perhaps on realizing that he was still alive, he had thrown him into the river.
067.086 --Oh! impossible!" cried Mme. Danglars; "one murders a man in revenge, one does not drown a child in cold blood!
067.087 --Perhaps, continued Villefort, he had put him in the "Enfants-Trouvés".
067.088 --Oh, yes, yes!" cried the baroness, "my child is here!
067.089 -- I ran to the hospice, and I learned that that very night, the night of September 20, a child had been deposited in the tower; he was wrapped in half a thin cloth napkin, torn with intent. This half of the napkin bore half a baron's crown and the letter H.
067.090 -That's it, that's it! cried Mme. Danglars, all my linen was marked thus; M. de Nargonne was a baron, and my name is Hermine. Thank you, my God! my child was not dead!
067.091 -- No, he was not dead!
067.092 --And you tell me that! You tell me that without fear of making me die of joy, sir! Where is he? Where is my child?"
067.093 Villefort shrugged his shoulders.
067.094 "Do I know it?" he said; "and do you think that if I knew it I would take you through all these gradations, as a dramatist or novelist would? No, alas, no, I do not know. A woman, about six months ago, had come to claim the child with the other half of the briefcase. This woman had given all the guarantees that the law requires, and he had been given to her.
067.095 --But you had to find out about this woman, you had to discover her.
067.096 --And what do you think I was doing, madam? I feigned a criminal investigation, and all that the police have of fine sleuths, of skilful agents, I put them in search of her. His tracks were found as far as Châlons; in Châlons they were lost.
067.097 --Lost?
067.098 --Yes, lost; lost forever."
067.099 Mme. Danglars had listened to this narrative with a sigh, a tear, a cry for each circumstance.
067.100 "And that is all," she said; "and you have confined yourself to that?
067.101 --Oh, no," said Villefort, "I have never ceased to search, to inquire, to inform myself. However, for the last two or three years, I have given myself some slackening. But today I am going to begin again with more perseverance and determination than ever; and I shall succeed, you see; for it is no longer conscience that drives me, it is fear.
067.102 --But," continued Mme. Danglars, "the Count of Monte Cristo knows nothing; otherwise, it seems to me, he would not seek us out as he does.
067.103 --Oh! the wickedness of men is very deep, said Villefort, since it is deeper than the goodness of God. Did you notice the eyes of this man as he spoke to us?
067.104 -- No.
067.105 --But have you ever looked deeply into them?
067.106 --Surely. He is strange, but that is all. One thing that struck me was that of all that exquisite food he gave us, he didn't touch anything, that of none of the dishes he wanted to take his share.
067.107 --Yes, yes!" said Villefort, "I noticed that too. If I had known what I know now, I would not have touched anything either; I would have believed that he wanted to poison us.
067.108 --And you would have been mistaken, you see.
067.109 -- Yes, no doubt; but, believe me, this man has other plans. That is why I wanted to see you, that is why I asked to speak to you, that is why I wanted to protect you from everyone, but especially from him. I have never heard of our affair," continued Villefort, fixing his eyes even more deeply on the baroness than he had done up to that point. "You have never spoken of it to anyone?
067.110 -- Never, to anyone.
067.111 --You understand me," Villefort continued affectionately, "when I say to no one, forgive my insistence, to no one in the world, do you?
067.112 -- Oh, yes, yes, I understand very well, said the baroness, blushing; never!
067.113 --You are not in the habit of writing in the evening what happened in the morning?
067.114 -- No! Alas! my life is carried away by frivolity; I myself forget it.
067.115 -- You do not dream high, do you know?
067.116 --I have a child's sleep; do you not remember it?"
067.117 The purple rose to the baroness's face, and pallor invaded Villefort's.
067.118 "That's true," he said so low that he could hardly be heard.
067.119 --Well?" asked the Baroness.
067.120 -- Well, I understand what I have to do," continued Villefort. Before eight days have passed, I shall know what M. de Monte Cristo is, where he comes from, where he is going, and why he is talking to us about the children who are being dug up in his garden."
067.121 Villefort pronounced these words with an accent that would have made the Count shudder if he could have heard them.
067.122 Then he shook the hand that the baroness was reluctant to give him and led her respectfully to the door.
067.123 Mrs. Danglars took another carriage, which brought her back to the passage, on the other side of which she found her carriage and her coachman, who, while waiting for her, was sleeping peacefully on his seat.
068.000 A summer ball.
068.001 On the same day, about the time Mrs. Danglars was having the session we have mentioned in the office of the King's Attorney, a carriage entered the Rue du Helder, passed through the door of No. 27 and stopped in the courtyard.
068.002 After a moment the door opened, and Mme de Morcerf got out, leaning on her son's arm.
068.003 No sooner had Albert driven his mother home than, ordering a bath and his horses, after putting himself in the hands of his valet, he was driven to the Champs-Élysées, to the Count of Monte-Cristo.
068.004 The Count received him with his usual smile. It was a strange thing: one never seemed to take a step forward in the heart or mind of this man. Those who wanted, if one may say so, to force their way into his intimacy found a wall.
068.005 Morcerf, who ran to him with open arms, let, on seeing him and in spite of his friendly smile, his arms fall, and at most dared to offer him his hand.
068.006 For his part, Monte Cristo touched it to him, as he always did, but without shaking it.
068.007 "Well, here I am," he said, "dear Count.
068.008 --Welcome.
068.009 --I arrived an hour ago.
068.010 --From Dieppe?
068.011 --From Treport.
068.012 --Ah, that's right.
068.013 --And my first visit is for you.
068.014 --That is charming of you, said Monte Cristo as he would have said anything else.
068.015 -- Well, let us see, what news?
068.016 --News! You ask that of me, a stranger!
068.017 --I understand myself: when I ask what news, I ask if you have done anything for me?
068.018 -Did you charge me with some commission?" said Monte Cristo, acting worried.
068.019 - "Come, come," said Albert, "do not pretend to be indifferent. It is said that there are sympathetic warnings which cross the distance: well! at Treport, I received my electric shot; you have, if not worked for me, at least thought of me.
068.020 --That is possible, said Monte Cristo. I did indeed think of you; but the magnetic current of which I was the conductor acted, I confess, independently of my will.
068.021 -- Really! Tell me about it, please.
068.022 --It is easy, Mr. Danglars dined at my house.
068.023 -- I know that, since it was to escape his presence that my mother and I left.
068.024 -- But he dined with Mr. Andrea Cavalcanti.
068.025 --Your Italian prince?
068.026 -- Let us not exaggerate. Mr. Andrea gives himself only the title of viscount.
068.027 --Gives himself, you say?
068.028 -- I say: gives himself.
068.029 -- So he is not?
068.030 -- Do I know that? He gives it to himself, I give it to him, it is given to him; is it not as if he had it?
068.031 -- Strange man that you are! Well?
068.032 --Well, what?
068.033 --Mr. Danglars has dined here?
068.034 --Yes.
068.035 --With your viscount Andrea Cavalcanti?
068.036 --With Viscount Andrea Cavalcanti, the Marquis his father, Mme. Danglars, M. and Mme. de Villefort, charming people, M. Debray, Maximilien Morrel, and then who else... wait a minute... ah! M. de Château-Renaud.
068.037 --Was there any mention of me?
068.038 -- They didn't say a word about it.
068.039 --That's too bad.
068.040 --Why is that? It seems to me that, if they have forgotten you, they have only done what you wanted!
068.041 -My dear Count, if one did not speak about me, it is because one thought much about it, and then I am desperate.
068.042 --What does it matter to you, since Mlle. Danglars was not among those who thought about it here! Ah, it is true that she could think about it at home.
068.043 --Oh, as for that, no, I am sure of it: or if she thought of it, it is certainly in the same way that I think of her.
068.044 --Touching sympathy! said the Count. So you hate each other?
068.045 --Listen, said Morcerf, if Mlle. Danglars were to take pity on the martyrdom I do not suffer for her and reward me for it outside of the matrimonial conveniences agreed upon between our two families, it would suit me perfectly. In short, I believe that Miss Danglars would be a charming mistress, but as a woman, hell....
068.046 --And so, said Monte Cristo, laughing, this is your way of thinking about your future?
068.047 --Oh, my God! yes, a little brutal, it is true, but exact at least. Now, since one cannot make this dream a reality; since to reach a certain goal it is necessary that Mlle. Danglars should become my wife, that is to say, that she should live with me, that she should think close to me, that she should sing close to me, that she should make verses and music ten paces from me, and that for the whole time of my life, then I am frightened. A mistress, my dear count, that can be left, but a woman, pest! it is another thing, that is kept eternally, from near or far that is to say. Now, it is frightening to keep Mlle. Danglars always, even from afar.
068.048 -- You are difficult, Vicomte.
068.049 -- Yes, because I often think of something impossible.
068.050 -- Which one?
068.051 -- To find a wife for me as my father found one for himself."
068.052 Monte Cristo paled and looked at Albert as he played with some magnificent pistols, the springs of which he was rapidly making to scream.
068.053 "So your father has been very happy," he said.
068.054 --You know my opinion of my mother, sir count: an angel from heaven; see her still beautiful, witty always, better than ever. I have just arrived from Le Tréport; for any other son, eh! my God! to accompany his mother would be an indulgence or a chore, but I have spent four days alone with her, more satisfied, more rested, more poetic, I would say, than if I had taken Queen Mab or Titania to Le Tréport.
068.055 --That is a despairing perfection, and you give all those who hear you serious desires to remain single.
068.056 --That is precisely why, knowing that there is an accomplished woman in the world, I do not care to marry Miss Danglars. Have you ever noticed how our egoism covers everything that belongs to us with brilliant colors? The diamond that shimmered in Marlé's or Fossin's window becomes much more beautiful since it is our diamond; but if the evidence forces you to recognize that it is of a purer water, and you are condemned to wear this diamond eternally inferior to another, do you understand the suffering?
068.057 --Fondain!" murmured the Count.
068.058 --That is why I shall jump for joy the day Miss Eugenie realizes that I am but a puny atom and that I have scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has millions."
068.059 Monte Cristo smiled.
068.060 "I had thought of something else," continued Albert; "Franz likes eccentric things, I wanted to make him in spite of himself in love with Miss Danglars; but to four letters I wrote him in the most affriandant of styles, Franz imperturbably replied: 'I am eccentric, it is true, but my eccentricity does not go so far as to take back my word when I have given it."
068.061 --This is what I call the devotion of friendship: to give to another the woman you yourself would only want as a mistress."
068.062 Albert smiled.
068.063 "By the way," he continued, "he's coming, dear Franz; but it doesn't matter to you, you don't love him, I think?
068.064 "Me!" said Monte Cristo; "my dear viscount, where did you see that I did not love Mr. Franz? I love everybody.
068.065 --And I am understood in everybody... thank you.
068.066 --Oh, let's not confuse things, said Monte Cristo: I love everyone in the way God commands us to love our neighbor, Christianly; but I only hate certain people. Let us return to M. Franz d'Épinay. So you say he is coming.
068.067 -- Yes, sent for by M. de Villefort, who is as enraged, it seems, to marry Miss Valentine as M. Danglars is to marry Miss Eugénie. It seems to me that it is a most tiresome state to be the father of grown-up girls; it seems to me that it gives them a fever, and that their pulse beats ninety times a minute, until they are rid of it.
068.068 --But M. d'Épinay is not like you; he takes his pain in patience.
068.069 --Better than that, he takes it seriously; he wears white ties and is already talking about his family. Besides, he has a great respect for the Villeforts.
068.070 --Deserved, isn't it?
068.071 -- I think so. I have always thought of M. de Villefort as a severe man, but a fair one.
068.072 -- "That's a good thing," said Monte Cristo, "at least you don't treat him like poor M. Danglars.
068.073 --This is perhaps because I am not forced to marry his daughter, replied Albert, laughing.
068.074 --In truth, my dear sir," said Monte Cristo, "you are revoltingly fatuous.
068.075 --Me?
068.076 -- Yes, you. Have a cigar.
068.077 -- I will gladly. And why am I fat?
068.078 --But because you are here defending yourself, struggling to marry Miss Danglars. My God, let things go on, and perhaps it is not you who will withdraw your word first.
068.079 --Bah!" said Albert with wide eyes.
068.080 --Eh! no doubt, monsieur le vicomte, they will not force your neck through the doors, what the hell! But I have to say that I am not going to be able to do anything about it, and I am not going to be able to do anything about it.
068.081 -- I would give a hundred thousand francs for that.
068.082 -- Well, be happy: M. Danglars is ready to give twice as much to achieve the same goal.
068.083 --Is this happiness really true? said Albert, who, however, while saying this could not prevent an imperceptible cloud from passing over his forehead. But, my dear count, M. Danglars has reasons?
068.084 --Ah, there you are, proud and egotistical nature! I am back to the man who wants to cut holes in the self-esteem of others with an axe, and who shouts when you cut holes in his own with a needle.
068.085 --No! but it seems to me that Mr. Danglars....
068.086 --Must have been delighted with you, right? Well, Mr. Danglars is a man of bad taste, that's agreed, and he's even more delighted with another....
068.087 --Who, then?
068.088 --I don't know; study, look, take in the allusions to their passage, and make your profit.
068.089 -- Well, I understand; listen, my mother... no! not my mother, I am mistaken, my father had the idea of giving a ball.
068.090 --A ball at this time of year?
068.091 --Summer balls are in fashion.
068.092 --They would not be there, the Countess would only have to want to, and she would put them there.
068.093 --Not bad; you understand, these are pure-blooded balls; those who stay in Paris in July are real Parisians. Will you take care of an invitation for Messrs. Cavalcanti?
068.094 --In how many days does your ball take place?
068.095 --Saturday.
068.096 --Mr. Cavalcanti Sr. will be gone.
068.097 --But Mr. Cavalcanti Jr. remains. Will you take charge of bringing Mr. Cavalcanti son?
068.098 -- Listen, Viscount, I don't know him.
068.099 -- You don't know him?
068.100 -- No; I saw him for the first time three or four days ago, and I cannot vouch for him.
068.101 --But you receive him well!
068.102 -It is another matter; he was recommended to me by a good abbot who may himself have been deceived. Invite him directly, wonderfully, but don't tell me to introduce him to you; if he were to marry Miss Danglars later, you would accuse me of a trick, and you would want to cut your throat with me; besides, I don't know if I will go myself.
068.103 --Where?
068.104 -- To your ball.
068.105 -- Why won't you come?
068.106 -- First, because you haven't invited me yet.
068.107 -- I am coming expressly to bring you your invitation myself.
068.108 -- Oh, that's too charming; but I can be prevented from doing so.
068.109 -- When I have told you something, you will be kind enough to sacrifice all impediments to us.
068.110 --Say.
068.111 --My mother begs you.
068.112 --Mrs. Countess de Morcerf?" said Monte Cristo, flinching.
068.113 --Ah! Count, said Albert, I warn you that Mme. de Morcerf talks freely with me; and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibers crackle in you of which I spoke to you just now, it is because you lack them completely, for for four days we have spoken only of you.
068.114 -About me? In truth you fill me up!
068.115 -- Listen, that's the privilege of your job: when you are a living problem.
068.116 --Ah, so I am also a problem for your mother? In truth, I would have thought her too reasonable to indulge in such flights of fancy!
068.117 --Problem, my dear Count, a problem for everyone, for my mother as well as for the others; a problem accepted, but not guessed at, you still remain an enigma: rest assured. My mother only asks how it is that you are so young. I think that, deep down, while the Countess G... takes you for Lord Ruthwen, my mother takes you for Cagliostro or the Count of Saint-Germain. The first time you come to see Mme de Morcerf, confirm her in this opinion. That will not be difficult for you, you have the philosopher's stone of the one and the spirit of the other.
068.118 --I thank you for warning me," said the Count, smiling, "I will try to put myself in a position to deal with all suppositions.
068.119 --So you will come on Saturday?
068.120 --Because Madame de Morcerf asks me to.
068.121 --You are charming.
068.122 --And Mr. Danglars?
068.123 -- Oh, he has already received the triple invitation; my father has taken care of that. We will also try to get the great d'Aguesseau, M. de Villefort; but we despair of that.
068.124 -- One should never despair of anything, as the proverb says.
068.125 --Do you dance, dear Count?
068.126 -- Me?
068.127 -- Yes, you. What wonder if you dance?
068.128 --Ah, indeed, as long as one has not passed the age of forty.... No, I don't dance; but I like to see dancing. And Mme de Morcerf, does she dance?
068.129 --Never, either; you will chat, she wants to chat with you so much!
068.130 --Really?
068.131 --Oath of honor! and I declare that you are the first man for whom my mother has shown this curiosity."
068.132 Albert took his hat and rose; the count led him back to the door.
068.133 "I have a reproach," he said, stopping him at the top of the stoop.
068.134 -What is it?
068.135 --I have been indiscreet, I should not have spoken to you about Mr. Danglars.
068.136 -- On the contrary, talk to me about it again, talk to me about it often, talk to me about it always; but in the same way.
068.137 -Good! You reassure me. By the way, when is Mr. d'Épinay coming?
068.138 --But in five or six days at the latest.
068.139 --And when is he getting married?
068.140 --As soon as Mr. and Mrs. de Saint-Méran arrive.
068.141 --Take him to me when he is in Paris. Even though you say I don't like him, I tell you I'll be happy to see him.
068.142 --Well, your orders will be carried out, Lord.
068.143 --Bye!
068.144 -- See you on Saturday, of course, won't you?
068.145 --How so! That's a promise."
068.146 The Count followed Albert with his eyes, waving him on. Then, when he had got back into his phaeton, he turned round, and finding Bertuccio behind him:
068.147 "Well?" he asked.
068.148 --She went to the Palace," replied the steward.
068.149 --Has she been there long?
068.150 --An hour and a half.
068.151 --And she went home?
068.152 --Directly.
068.153 --Well, my dear Mr. Bertuccio," said the Count, "if I have any advice to give you now, it is to go to Normandy and see if you can't find that little piece of land I told you about."
068.154 Bertuccio saluted, and, as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the order he had received, he left that same evening.
069.000 Information.
069.001 M. de Villefort kept his word to Mme. Danglars, and especially to himself, by trying to find out how the Count of Monte Cristo could have learned the history of the house of Auteuil.
069.002 He wrote the same day to a certain M. de Boville, who, after having been formerly inspector of the prisons, had been attached, in a higher rank, to the police of safety, to have the information which he desired, and this one asked for two days to know exactly near whom one could inquire.
069.003 When the two days were up, M. de Villefort received the following note:
069.004 "The person known as M. le comte de Monte-Cristo is known particularly to Lord Wilmore, a wealthy foreigner, who is sometimes seen in Paris and who is there at the moment; he is also known to the Abbé Busoni, a Sicilian priest of great reputation in the East, where he has done many good works."
069.005 M. de Villefort replied with an order to take the most prompt and accurate information about these two strangers; the next evening his orders were carried out, and here is the information he received:
069.006 The abbot, who was only for a month in Paris, lived, behind Saint-Sulpice, in a small house composed of a single floor above a first floor; four rooms, two rooms upstairs and two rooms downstairs, made up the whole dwelling, of which he was the sole tenant.
069.007 The two rooms below consisted of a dining room with a table, two chairs and a walnut sideboard, and a living room painted white, with no ornaments, no carpet and no clock. One could see that the abbot limited himself to the objects of strict necessity.
069.008 It is true that the abbot lived preferably in the salon on the second floor. This room, furnished with books of theology and parchments, in the midst of which he was seen to bury himself, his valet said, for months on end, was in reality less a room than a library.
069.009 This valet looked at the visitors through a sort of window, and when their faces were unknown to him or did not please him, he answered that the abbot was not in Paris, which many people were content with, knowing that the abbot often traveled and sometimes stayed a long time.
069.010 Besides, whether he was at home or not, whether he was in Paris or in Cairo, the abbot always gave, and the window served as a tower for the alms that the valet distributed incessantly in the name of his master.
069.011 The other room, near the library, was a bedroom. A bed without curtains, four armchairs and a sofa of yellow Utrecht velvet formed, with a prie-Dieu, all its furnishings.
069.012 As for Lord Wilmore, he lived in rue Fontaine-Saint-Georges. He was one of those English tourists who eat up all their fortune on trips. He rented the apartment he lived in as a garni, in which he came to spend only two or three hours a day, and where he rarely slept. One of his idiosyncrasies was that he did not want to speak the French language, which he wrote, however, with great purity.
069.013 The day after this precious information had reached the King's prosecutor, a man, who was getting out of his car at the corner of the Rue Férou, knocked on a door painted olive green and asked for the Abbé Busoni.
069.014 "Mr. Abbot went out in the morning," answered the valet.
069.015 --I might not be satisfied with this answer, said the visitor, for I come from a person for whom one is always at home. But please give to the abbot Busoni....
069.016 --I already told you that he was not there, repeated the valet.
069.017 --So when he comes back, give him this card and this sealed paper. Tonight at eight o'clock will the Abbot be home?
069.018 --Oh, without fail, sir, unless the Abbot is working, and then it is as if he were out.
069.019 --I'll be back tonight at the appointed hour," said the visitor.
069.020 And he withdrew.
069.021 Indeed, at the hour indicated, the same man returned in the same car, which this time, instead of stopping at the corner of the Rue Ferou, stopped in front of the green door. He knocked, it was opened to him, and he entered.
069.022 By the signs of respect with which the valet was lavishly greeted, he understood that his letter had had the desired effect.
069.023 "Is the abbot at home?" he asked.
069.024 --Yes, he is working in his library; but he is waiting for the gentleman," answered the servant.
069.025 The stranger climbed a rather rough staircase, and, in front of a table whose surface was flooded with the light concentrated by a vast lampshade, while the rest of the apartment was in shadow, he saw the abbot, in an ecclesiastical habit, his head covered with those poppy covers under which the skulls of the scholars in _us_ of the Middle Ages were buried.
069.026 "Is it to Monsieur Busoni that I have the honor of speaking?" asked the visitor.
069.027 --Yes, sir," replied the abbot, "and you are the person whom M. de Boville, former intendant of the prisons, has sent me on behalf of M. the Prefect of Police?
069.028 --Just so, sir.
069.029 -- One of the agents in charge of the security of Paris?
069.030 --Yes, sir," answered the stranger with a sort of hesitation, and above all a little redness.
069.031 The abbot readjusted the large glasses that covered not only his eyes but also his temples, and, sitting down again, motioned to the visitor to sit down in turn.
069.032 "I am listening to you, sir," said the abbot with a most pronounced Italian accent.
069.033 "The mission with which I have been entrusted, sir," continued the visitor, weighing each of his words as if they had difficulty in coming out, "is a mission of trust for the one who fulfills it and for the one near whom it is fulfilled.
069.034 The abbot bowed.
069.035 "Yes," said the stranger, "your probity, Monsieur l'abbé, is so well known to the Prefect of Police that he wants to know from you, as a magistrate, something that interests this public safety in whose name I am deputy. We hope therefore, Mr. Abbot, that there will be neither bonds of friendship nor human consideration which can engage you to disguise the truth to justice.
069.036 --Provided, sir, that the things you need to know do not touch the scruples of my conscience. I am a priest, sir, and the secrets of confession, for example, must remain between me and the justice of God, and not between me and human justice.
069.037 --Oh, rest assured, Mr. Abbot," said the stranger, "in any case we will put your conscience to rest."
069.038 At these words the abbot, weighing down the lampshade on his side, raised the same shade on the opposite side, so that, while illuminating the stranger's face in full, his own always remained in shadow.
069.039 "Pardon, Monsieur l'abbé," said the envoy of M. le préfet de Police, "but this light tires my sight horribly."
069.040 The abbot lowered the green cardboard.
069.041 "Now, sir, I listen to you, speak.
069.042 --I come to the point. Do you know the Count of Monte Cristo?
069.043 --You mean Mr. Zaccone, I presume?
069.044 --Zaccone!... He is not called Monte Cristo!
069.045 --Monte-Cristo is a name of the land, or rather a name of a rock, and not a family name.
069.046 -- Well, so be it; let us not argue about words, and since Mr. de Monte Cristo and Mr. Zaccone are the same man....
069.047 --Absolutely the same.
069.048 --Let's talk about Mr. Zaccone.
069.049 --So.
069.050 --I was asking if you knew him?
069.051 --About.
069.052 --What is he?
069.053 --He is the son of a rich shipowner from Malta.
069.054 --Yes, I know that, that's what they say; but, as you understand, the police cannot be satisfied with _on-dit_.
069.055 - "However," said the abbot with a smile of affability, "when this _on-dit_ is the truth, everyone must be content with it, and the police must do as everyone else.
069.056 --But are you sure of what you are saying?
069.057 --How can I be sure?
069.058 --Remark, sir, that I in no way suspect your good faith. I say to you: Are you sure?
069.059 --Listen, I knew Mr. Zaccone the father.
069.060 --Ah! ah!
069.061 --Yes, and as a child I played ten times with his son in their construction sites.
069.062 --But this title of Count?
069.063 --You know, that can be bought.
069.064 --In Italy?
069.065 --Partly.
069.066 --But these riches which are immense as they always say....
069.067 --Oh! as for that, answered the abbot, immense is the word.
069.068 --How much do you think he has, you who know him?
069.069 --Oh, he has a hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand pounds of income.
069.070 --Ah! that is reasonable, said the visitor, but one speaks of three, four millions!
069.071 --Two hundred thousand pounds of income, sir, makes just four million in capital.
069.072 --But we were talking about three to four million in annuities!
069.073 --Oh! that is unbelievable.
069.074 --And you know his island of Monte Cristo?
069.075 --Certainly; any man who has come from Palermo, Naples or Rome to France, by sea, knows it, since he has passed by it and seen it in passing.
069.076 - It is an enchanting stay, one assures.
069.077 --It is a rock.
069.078 --And why did the Count buy a rock?
069.079 --Just to be a count. In Italy, to be a count, one still needs a county.
069.080 --You have no doubt heard of the youthful adventures of Mr. Zaccone.
069.081 --The father?
069.082 --No, the son.
069.083 --Ah! here is where my uncertainties begin, for here is where I lost sight of my young comrade.
069.084 --He was in the war?
069.085 -- I think he served.
069.086 --In what army?
069.087 --In the navy.
069.088 --Let's see, you are not his confessor?
069.089 --No, sir; I believe him to be a Lutheran.
069.090 --What do you mean, Lutheran?
069.091 -- I say that I believe; I do not affirm. Besides, I thought freedom of worship was established in France.
069.092 -- No doubt, so it is not his beliefs that we are concerned with at the moment, but his actions; in the name of the Prefect of Police, I summon you to tell what you know.
069.093 -- He is considered a very charitable man. Our holy father the pope made him a knight of Christ, a favor he grants only to princes, for the eminent services he has rendered to the Christians of the East; he has five or six great cords won by services rendered in this way to princes or to states.
069.094 --And he wears them?
069.095 --No, but he is proud of them; he says he likes better the rewards given to the benefactors of humanity than those given to the destroyers of men.
069.096 --Is this man a Quaker?
069.097 -- He is a Quaker, minus the big hat and the brown suit, of course.
069.098 --Do we know any friends?
069.099 --Yes, for he has for friends all those who know him.
069.100 --But he does have some enemies?
069.101 --Only one.
069.102 --What do you call him?
069.103 --Lord Wilmore.
069.104 --Where is he?
069.105 -- In Paris at this very moment.
069.106 --And he can give me information?
069.107 --Precious. He was in India at the same time as Zaccone.
069.108 --Do you know where he is staying?
069.109 --Somewhere in the Chaussée-d'Antin; but I don't know the street or the number.
069.110 --You are ill with this Englishman?
069.111 --I love Zaccone and he hates him; we are at odds because of that.
069.112 --Mr. Abbot, do you think the Count of Monte Cristo ever came to France before the trip he just made to Paris?
069.113 --Ah! for that, I can answer you pertinently. No, sir, he has never been there, since he came to me six months ago to obtain the information he wanted. As I did not know when I would be back in Paris, I sent Mr. Cavalcanti to him.
069.114 --Andrea?
069.115 --No; Bartolomeo, the father.
069.116 --Very well, sir; I have only one more thing to ask of you, and I beg you, in the name of honor, humanity and religion, to answer me without detour.
069.117 --Say, sir.
069.118 --Do you know for what purpose the Count of Monte Cristo bought a house in Auteuil?
069.119 --Certainly, because he told me so.
069.120 --For what purpose, sir?
069.121 --In order to make it a hospice for the insane in the style of the one founded by the Baron of Pisani, in Palermo. Do you know this hospice?
069.122 - By reputation, yes, sir.
069.123 -It is a magnificent institution."
069.124 And with that, the abbot greeted the stranger like a man who wants to make it clear that he would not mind getting back to the interrupted work. The visitor, either understanding the abbot's desire or being at the end of his questions, rose in turn.
069.125 The abbot led him to the door.
069.126 "You give rich alms," said the visitor, "and even though you are said to be rich, I will dare to offer you something for your poor.
069.127 --Thank you, sir, there is only one thing I am jealous of in the world, and that is that the good I do comes from me.
069.128 --But still....
069.129 --This is an invariable resolution. But seek, sir, and you shall find: alas! on the path of every rich man there are many miseries to be elbowed!"
069.130 The abbot saluted one last time as he opened the door; the stranger saluted in his turn and went out.
069.131 The carriage drove him straight to M. de Villefort's house.
069.132 An hour later, the carriage left again, and this time headed for the Rue Fontaine-Saint-Georges. At No. 5 it stopped. That was where Lord Wilmore lived.
069.133 The stranger had written to Lord Wilmore asking for an appointment, which Lord Wilmore had fixed for ten o'clock. So when the Commissioner's envoy arrived at ten minutes to ten, he was told that Lord Wilmore, who was accuracy and punctuality itself, had not yet returned, but that he would certainly return at ten o'clock on the dot.
069.134 The visitor waited in the drawing room. The room was unremarkable and like all hotel rooms, it was furnished.
069.135 A fireplace with two modern Sèvres vases, a clock with a Love stretching his bow, a two-piece mirror; on each side of this mirror an engraving representing, one Homer carrying his guide, the other Belisarius asking for alms, a gray-on-gray paper, a piece of furniture made of red cloth printed with black: such was Lord Wilmore's salon.
069.136 It was illuminated by globes of frosted glass that shed only a dim light, which seemed to be provided on purpose for the tired eyes of the envoy of the Prefect of Police.
069.137 After ten minutes of waiting, the clock struck ten; at the fifth stroke, the door opened and Lord Wilmore appeared.
069.138 Lord Wilmore was a tall man rather than a short one, with sparse red sideburns, a white complexion, and greying blond hair. He was dressed with all English eccentricity, that is, he wore a blue suit with gold buttons and a high quilted collar, as they were worn in 1811: a white casimir vest and nankin pants three inches too short, but which were prevented from reaching his knees by underpants of the same material.
069.139 His first word on entering was:
069.140 "You know, sir, that I do not speak French.
069.141 --I know, at least, that you do not like to speak our language," replied the envoy of the Prefect of Police.
069.142 --But you can speak it, you," continued Lord Wilmore, "because, if I don't speak it, I understand it.
069.143 --And I," continued the visitor, changing idiom, "speak English easily enough to carry on a conversation in that language. So don't be shy, sir.
069.144 --Hao!" said Lord Wilmore with that intonation which belongs only to the purest of British natives.
069.145 The Police Commissioner's envoy presented Lord Wilmore with his letter of introduction. The latter read it with a very Anglican phlegm; then, when he had finished reading it, he said
069.146 "I understand," he said in English; "I understand very well."
069.147 Then began the interrogations.
069.148 They were much the same as those which had been addressed to the Abbot Busoni. But as Lord Wilmore, as an enemy of the Count of Monte Cristo, did not put the same restraint into them as the abbot, they were much more extensive; he told of the youth of Monte Cristo, who, according to him, had, at the age of ten, entered the service of one of those little sovereigns of India who make war on the English; it was there that he, Wilmore, had met him for the first time, and that they had fought against each other. In this war, Zaccone had been taken prisoner, sent to England, put on the pontoons, from where he had escaped by swimming. Then began his travels, his duels, his passions; then came the Greek insurrection, he served in the ranks of the Greeks. While he was in their service, he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of Thessaly, but he had been careful not to tell anyone about this discovery. After Navarin, and when the Greek government was consolidated, he asked king Otto for a privilege of exploitation for this mine, this privilege was granted to him. Hence this immense fortune, which could, according to Lord Wilmore, amount to one or two million in revenue, a fortune which, nevertheless, could suddenly dry up, if the mine itself dried up.
069.149 "But," asked the visitor, "do you know why he came to France?
069.150 --He wants to speculate on railroads, said Lord Wilmore; and then, as he is a skilful chemist and no less distinguished physicist, he has discovered a new telegraph, the application of which he is pursuing.
069.151 --How much does he spend per year? asked the envoy of the Prefect of Police.
069.152 --Oh! five or six hundred thousand francs, at the most, said Lord Wilmore; he is stingy."
069.153 It was evident that hatred made the Englishman speak, and that, not knowing what thing to reproach the count with, he reproached him for his avarice.
069.154 "Do you know anything about his house at Auteuil?
069.155 --Yes, certainly.
069.156 --Well, what do you know about it?
069.157 --You ask for what purpose he bought it?
069.158 --Yes.
069.159 -- Well, the Count is a speculator who will certainly ruin himself in trials and utopias: he claims that there is in Auteuil, in the vicinity of the house he has just acquired, a stream of mineral water that can rival the waters of Bagnères, Luchon and Cauterets. He wants to make of his acquisition a _badhaus_ as the Germans say. He has already turned over his whole garden two or three times to find the famous watercourse; and as he has not been able to discover it, you will see him, in a short time, buying the houses which surround his. Now, as I am angry with him, I hope that in his railroad, in his electric telegraph or in his baths operation, he will ruin himself; I am following him to enjoy his discomfiture, which cannot fail to arrive one day or the other.
069.160 --And why do you blame him?" asked the visitor.
069.161 --I blame him, answered Lord Wilmore, because in passing through England he seduced the wife of a friend of mine.
069.162 -- But if you are angry with him, why don't you seek revenge on him?
069.163 --I have already fought three times with the Count, said the Englishman: the first time with a pistol; the second with a sword; the third with a swordfish.
069.164 --And the result of these duels was?
069.165 --The first time, he broke my arm; the second time, he pierced my lung; and the third, he gave me this wound."
069.166 The Englishman folded down a shirt collar that came up to his ears, and showed a scar whose redness indicated its not very ancient date.
069.167 "So that I blame him very much," repeated the Englishman, "and that he will die, of course, only by my hand.
069.168 --But, said the envoy of the prefecture, you are not going to kill him, it seems to me.
069.169 --Hao!" said the Englishman, "every day I go shooting, and every other day Grisier comes to my house."
069.170 This was what the visitor wanted to know, or rather it was all that the Englishman seemed to know. So the agent rose, and after greeting Lord Wilmore, who answered him with English stiffness and politeness, he withdrew.
069.171 For his part, Lord Wilmore, after hearing the door to the street close upon him, returned to his bedroom, where, in the twinkling of an eye, he lost his blond hair, his red sideburns, his false jaw, and his scar, and regained the black hair, the matte complexion, and the pearl teeth of the Count of Monte Cristo.
069.172 It is true that, for his part, it was M. de Villefort, and not the envoy of the Prefect of Police, who returned to M. de Villefort's house.
069.173 The king's prosecutor was somewhat reassured by this double visit, which, moreover, had taught him nothing reassuring, but which had taught him nothing disturbing either. The result was that, for the first time since the dinner at Auteuil, he slept the following night with some peace of mind.
070.000 The ball.
070.001 It was the hottest day in July when, in the order of things, the Saturday came along when M. de Morcerf's ball was to take place.
070.002 It was ten o'clock in the evening: the tall trees of the garden of the Count's hotel stood out in force against a sky where the last vapors of a storm that had been rumbling threateningly all day were slipping down, discovering an azure curtain strewn with golden stars.
070.003 In the rooms of the first floor, one heard to rustle the music and to swirl the waltz and the gallop while bright bands of light passed sharp through the openings of the shutters.
070.004 The garden was at this moment given over to a dozen servants, to whom the mistress of the house, reassured by the weather which was becoming more and more calm, had just given the order to prepare supper.
070.005 Until then one had hesitated if one would dine in the dining room or under a long tent of coutil set up on the lawn. The beautiful blue sky, dotted with stars, had decided the case in favor of the tent and the lawn.
070.006 The paths of the garden were illuminated with colored lanterns, as is the custom in Italy, and the supper table was overloaded with candles and flowers, as is the custom in all countries where one understands a little of this luxury of the table, the rarest of all luxuries, when one wants to meet it complete.
070.007 At the moment when the Countess de Morcerf returned to her salons, after having given her last orders, the salons began to fill with guests attracted by the charming hospitality of the Countess, much more than by the distinguished position of the Count; for it was certain in advance that this feast would offer, thanks to the good taste of Mercedes, some details worthy of being recounted or copied if necessary.
070.008 Mme. Danglars, to whom the events we have narrated had inspired deep anxiety, was hesitating to go to Mme. de Morcerf's house, when in the morning her carriage had passed that of Villefort. Villefort had made a sign to him, the two carriages had drawn nearer, and through the doors:
070.009 "You are going to Mme. de Morcerf's, aren't you?" the King's Attorney had asked.
070.010 --No, Mrs. Danglars had replied, I am too ill.
070.011 --You are wrong," Villefort continued with a significant look; "it would be important that you should be seen there.
070.012 --Ah! do you think so? asked the baroness.
070.013 --I believe it.
070.014 --In that case, I will go."
070.015 And the two carriages had resumed their divergent course. Mme. Danglars had thus come, not only beautiful with her own beauty, but also dazzling with luxury; she was entering by one door at the same time that Mercédès was entering by the other.
070.016 The countess untied Albert in front of Mrs. Danglars; Albert came forward, paid the baroness the deserved compliments on her toilet, and took her arm to lead her to the place she would like to choose.
070.017 Albert looked around.
070.018 "Are you looking for my daughter?" said the baroness, smiling.
070.019 --I admit it," said Albert; "would you have been cruel enough not to bring her to us?"
070.020 --Resure yourself, she met Mlle. de Villefort and took her arm; here they are, both following us in white dresses, one with a bouquet of camellias, the other with a bouquet of forget-me-nots; but tell me, then?
070.021 --What are you looking for in your turn?" asked Albert, smiling.
070.022 -Don't you have the Count of Monte Cristo this evening?
070.023 --Sixty-seven!" answered Albert.
070.024 --What do you mean?
070.025 --I mean that it is going well," said the viscount, laughing, "and that you are the seventeenth person who has asked me the same question; the count is doing well!
070.026 --And do you answer everyone as you do me?
070.027 --Ah, it's true, I haven't answered you; don't worry, madam, we'll have the man in fashion, we are privileged.
070.028 --Were you at the Opera yesterday?
070.029 -- No.
070.030 --He was there.
070.031 --Ah, really! And did the _excentric man_ make any new originality?
070.032 --Can he show himself without it? Elssler danced in the _Diable boiteux_; the Greek princess was in rapture. After the cachucha, he passed a magnificent ring in the tail of the bouquet, and threw it to the charming dancer, who in the third act reappeared, to honor him, with her ring on her finger. And his Greek princess, will you have her?
070.033 --No, you must do without her; her position in the Count's house is not fixed enough.
070.034 --Here, leave me here and go and greet Mme. de Villefort, said the baroness: I see that she is dying to speak to you."
070.035 Albert saluted Mme. Danglars and advanced toward Mme. de Villefort, who opened her mouth as he approached.
070.036 "I bet," said Albert, interrupting her, "that I know what you are going to tell me?
070.037 --Ah! for example!" said Mme de Villefort.
070.038 -If I guess right, will you admit it to me?
070.039 --Yes.
070.040 --Honor?
070.041 --Honor.
070.042 --You were going to ask me if the Count of Monte Cristo had arrived or was coming?
070.043 --Not at all. It is not about him at the moment. I was going to ask you if you had received any news from Mr. Franz.
070.044 --Yes, yesterday.
070.045 --What did he say to you?
070.046 -- That he was leaving at the same time as his letter.
070.047 --Well, now the Count?
070.048 --The Count will come, rest assured.
070.049 --You know that he has another name than Monte Cristo?
070.050 -- No, I did not know.
070.051 --Monte-Cristo is an island name, and he has a family name.
070.052 --I have never heard it pronounced.
070.053 --Well, I am more advanced than you; his name is Zaccone.
070.054 --That's possible.
070.055 --He is Maltese.
070.056 --That's possible too.
070.057 --Son of a shipowner.
070.058 --Oh, but in truth, you should tell these things out loud, you would have the greatest success.
070.059 --He served in India, exploits a silver mine in Thessaly, and comes to Paris to make a mineral water establishment in Auteuil.
070.060 -- Well, that's good news," said Morcerf. Will you allow me to repeat it?
070.061 -- Yes, but little by little, one by one, without saying that they come from me.
070.062 --Why is that?
070.063 --Because it is almost a surprised secret.
070.064 --To whom?
070.065 --To the police.
070.066 --Then this news was spread....
070.067 --Yesterday evening, at the prefect's house. Paris was moved, as you well understand, at the sight of this unusual luxury, and the police took information.
070.068 --Well, all that was needed was to arrest the Count as a vagrant, on the pretext that he was too rich.
070.069 --My goodness, that's what might have happened to him if the information hadn't been so favorable.
070.070 --Poor Count, and does he have any idea of the danger he has run?
070.071 --I don't think so.
070.072 --Then it is charity to warn him of it. When he arrives I will not fail to do so."
070.073 At this moment a handsome young man with lively eyes, black hair, and a shiny moustache came to greet Mme. de Villefort respectfully. Albert offered him his hand.
070.074 "Madame," said Albert, "I have the honor of presenting to you Mr. Maximilien Morrel, captain of the spahis, one of our good and especially brave officers.
070.075 --I have already had the pleasure of meeting monsieur at Auteuil, at the home of M. le Comte de Monte-Cristo," replied Mme. de Villefort, turning away with marked coldness.
070.076 This reply, and especially the tone in which it was made, clenched poor Morrel's heart; but a compensation was provided for him: as he turned, he saw at the corner of the door a beautiful, white figure whose dilated, expressionless eyes were fixed on him, while the bouquet of forget-me-nots slowly rose to his lips.
070.077 This greeting was so well understood that Morrel, with the same expression of look, in turn brought his handkerchief to his mouth; and the two living statues whose hearts beat so rapidly under the apparent marble of their faces, separated from each other by the whole width of the room, forgot themselves for a moment, or rather for a moment forgot all the world in this silent contemplation.
070.078 They could have remained longer thus lost in each other, without anyone noticing their oblivion of all things: the Count of Monte Cristo had just entered.
070. 079 We have already said it, the count, either factitious prestige, or natural prestige, attracted the attention everywhere where he presented himself; it was not his black habit, irreproachable it is true in its cut, but simple and without decorations; it was not his white vest without any embroidery; it was not his pants embracing a foot of the most delicate form, which drew the attention it was his matte complexion, his wavy black hair, it was his calm and pure face, it was his deep and melancholy eye, it was finally his mouth drawn with marvelous finesse, and which so easily took on the expression of high disdain, which made all eyes fix on him.
070.080 There might have been more beautiful men, but there were certainly none more _significant_, let us pass this expression: everything in the Count meant something and had its value; for the habit of useful thought had given his features, the expression of his face and the most insignificant of his gestures an incomparable suppleness and firmness.
070.081 And then our Parisian world is so strange, that it would perhaps not have paid any attention to all this, if there had not been underneath it all a mysterious story gilded by an immense fortune.
070.082 Be that as it may, he advanced, under the weight of glances and through the exchange of small greetings, to Mme. de Morcerf, who, standing before the flower-bedecked fireplace, had seen him appear in a mirror placed opposite the door, and had prepared to receive him.
070.083 So she turned toward him with a composed smile at the very moment he bowed to her.
070.084 No doubt she thought the Count was going to speak to her; no doubt, on his part, the Count thought she was going to speak to him; but on both sides they remained mute, so banal did they seem to be to both of them; and, after an exchange of greetings, Monte Cristo moved towards Albert, who was coming to him with his hand open.
070.085 "Have you seen my mother?" asked Albert.
070.086 --I have just had the honor of greeting her, said the Count, but I have not seen your father.
070.087 --Here! he is talking politics, over there, in that little group of great celebrities.
070.088 --In truth, said Monte Cristo, those gentlemen I see over there are celebrities? I would not have suspected it! And of what kind? There are celebrities of all kinds, as you know.
070.089 -- There is first of all a scientist, this tall, dry gentleman; he discovered in the countryside of Rome a species of lizard which has one more vertebra than the others, and he came back to tell the Institute about this discovery. The thing was disputed for a long time: but force remained with the big dry man. The vertebra had made a lot of noise in the learned world; the tall dry man was only a knight of the Legion of Honor, he was made an officer.
070.090 -- Good heavens! said Monte Cristo, here is a cross which seems to me wisely given; then, if he finds a second vertebra, they will make him a commander?
070.091 --That is probable, said Morcerf.
070.092 --And this other who had the singular idea of dressing in a blue suit embroidered with green, what can he be?
070.093 --It was not he who had the idea of putting on this habit: it was the Republic, which, as you know, was a bit of an artist, and which, wanting to give a uniform to the academicians, asked David to draw them a habit.
070.094 --Ah, really, said Monte Cristo; so this gentleman is an academician?
070.095 --For eight days he has been a member of the learned assembly.
070.096 --And what is his merit, his specialty?
070.097 --His specialty? I think he sticks pins in the heads of rabbits, makes chickens eat madder, and pushes the spinal cord of dogs with whales.
070.098 --And he is a member of the Academy of Sciences for this?
070.099 --No, the French Academy.
070.100 --But what does the French Academy have to do with it?
070.101 --I'll tell you, it seems ....
070.102 --That his experiments have made a great step forward in science, no doubt?
070.103 --No, but that he writes in a very good style.
070.104 --That must, said Monte Cristo, flatter enormously the self-esteem of the rabbits to whom he sticks pins in the head, of the hens whose bones he dyes red, and of the dogs whose spinal cord he pushes back."
070.105 Albert began to laugh.
070.106 "And that other one?" asked the Count.
070.107 --That other one?
070.108 --Yes, the third one.
070.109 --Ah! the blue bearded suit?
070.110 --Yes.
070.111 --This is a colleague of the Count's, who has just opposed most vehemently that the Chamber of Peers should have a uniform; he had a great success in the tribune on that subject; he was ill with the liberal gazettes, but his noble opposition to the desires of the court has just reconciled him with them; there is talk of appointing him ambassador.
070.112 -- And what are his titles to the peerage?
070.113 -- He has made two or three comic operas, taken four or five shares in the _Siècle_, and voted five or six years for the ministry.
070.114 --Bravo! Viscount, said Monte Cristo, laughing, you are a charming cicerone; now you will do me a favor, will you not?
070.115 -What is it?
070.116 --You will not introduce me to these gentlemen, and if they ask to be introduced to me, you will warn me."
070.117 At this moment the count felt that someone was laying a hand on his arm; he turned around, it was Danglars.
070.118 "Ah! it is you, Baron!" he said.
070.119 - "Why do you call me baron?" said Danglars; "you know very well that I do not care for my title. It is not like you, viscount; you do care, don't you?
070.120 - "Certainly," replied Albert, "since if I were not a viscount I would be nothing, whereas you can sacrifice your title of baron, you will still be a millionaire.
070.121 --This seems to me the most beautiful title under the July royalty, Danglars continued.
070.122 --Unfortunately, said Monte Cristo, one is not a millionaire for life as one is a baron, a peer of France or an academician; witness the millionaires Frank and Poulmann, of Frankfurt, who have just gone bankrupt.
070.123 --Really?" said Danglars, turning pale.
070.124 --My goodness, I received the news this evening by mail; I had something like a million with them; but, warned in time, I demanded repayment about a month ago.
070.125 --Ah, my God!" resumed Danglars; "they shot me for two hundred thousand francs.
070.126 -- Well, you have been warned; their signature is worth five percent.
070.127 --Yes, but I was warned too late, said Danglars, I honored their signature.
070.128 --Good! said Monte Cristo, here are two hundred thousand francs which have gone to ....
070.129 --Hush! said Danglars; do not speak of such things...."
070.130 Then, approaching Monte Cristo: "especially in front of M. Cavalcanti fils," added the banker, who, pronouncing these words, turned smilingly to the side of the young man.
070.131 Morcerf had left the count to go and speak to his mother. Danglars left him to greet Cavalcanti fils. Monte Cristo found himself alone for a moment.
070.132 However, the heat began to become excessive.
070.133 The valets circulated in the salons with trays loaded with fruit and ice cream.
070.134 Monte Cristo wiped his face wet with sweat with his handkerchief; but he stepped back when the tray passed in front of him, and took nothing to refresh himself.
070.135 Madame de Morcerf did not lose sight of Monte Cristo. She saw the tray pass without his touching it; she even caught the movement by which he moved away from it.
070.136 "Albert," she said, "have you noticed anything?
070.137 -What is it, my mother?
070.138 --That the Count never wanted to accept dinner at M. de Morcerf's.
070.139 --Yes, but he agreed to lunch at my house, since it was through this lunch that he made his entrance into the world.
070.140 --Your house is not the Count's," murmured Mercedes, "and since he has been here I have been examining him.
070.141 --Well?
070.142 -- Well, he hasn't taken anything yet.
070.143 --The Count is very sober."
070.144 Mercedes smiled sadly.
070.145 "Get close to him," she said, "and, at the first tray that passes, insist.
070.146 --Why is that, my mother?
070.147 - "Give me that pleasure, Albert," said Mercedes.
070.148 Albert kissed his mother's hand and went to stand by the Count.
070.149 Another tray passed loaded like the previous ones; she saw Albert insisting near the Count, even taking an ice cream and presenting it to him, but he obstinately refused.
070.150 Albert returned to his mother; the Countess was very pale.
070.151 "Well," she said, "you see, he refused.
070.152 --Yes; but why should that concern you?
070.153 --You know, Albert, women are singular. I would have been pleased to see the Count take something from me, even if it were only a pomegranate. Perhaps he is not accustomed to French customs, perhaps he has a preference for something.
070.154 -God, no! I saw him in Italy taking everything; no doubt he is not well disposed this evening.
070.155 -Then, said the countess, having always lived in bright climates, perhaps he is less sensitive than others to the heat?
070.156 --I don't think so, for he complained of suffocation, asked why, since the windows had already been opened, the blinds had not been opened as well.
070.157 --In effect, said Mercedes, it is a way of assuring me whether this abstinence is a bias."
070.158 And she left the salon.
070.159 A moment later the shutters opened, and through the jasmines and clematis that lined the windows one could see the whole garden illuminated with lanterns and the supper served in the tent.
070.160 Dancers, gamblers and talkers shouted with joy: all these thirsty lungs were sucking up the air that was flowing in with delight.
070.161 At the same moment Mercedes reappeared, paler than she had been, but with that firmness of face which was remarkable in her in certain circumstances. She went straight to the group of which her husband formed the center:
070.162 "Do not chain these gentlemen here, sir count," she said, "they will like it as much, if they do not play, to breathe in the garden as to suffocate here.
070.163 - "Ah, madame," said a gallant old general, who had sung: "Let us go to Syria! in 1809, "we shall not go alone to the garden.
070.164 --So be it, said Mercedes, I will give the example."
070.165 And turning to Monte Cristo:
070.166 "Monsieur le Comte," she said, "do me the honor of offering me your arm."
070.167 The Count almost staggered at these simple words; then he looked for a moment at Mercedes. This moment had the rapidity of lightning, and yet it seemed to the countess that it lasted for a century, so much thought had Monte Cristo put into this one glance. He offered his arm to the countess; she leaned on it, or, to better say, she touched it with her small hand, and both went down one of the stairs of the perron bordered of rhododendrons and camellias. Behind them, and by the other staircase, rushed into the garden, with loud exclamations of pleasure, a score of walkers.
071.000 Bread and salt.
071.001 Madame de Morcerf entered under the canopy of foliage with her companion: this canopy was an avenue of lime trees which led to a greenhouse.
071.002 "It was too hot in the salon, wasn't it, Monsieur le Comte?
071.003 --Yes, madam; and your idea of having the doors and shutters opened is an excellent idea."
071.004 As he finished these words, the Count noticed that Mercedes' hand was trembling.
071.005 "But you, with this light dress and no other preservative around your neck than this gauze scarf, you may be cold?" he said.
071.006 --Do you know where I am taking you?" said the Countess, without answering Monte Cristo's question.
071.007 -- No, madam, replied the latter; friends, you see, I make no resistance.
071.008 --To the greenhouse, which you see there, at the end of the alley we are following."
071.009 The Count looked at Mercedes as if to question her; but she went on her way without saying anything, and for his part Monte Cristo remained mute.
071.010 They arrived at the building, which was all lined with magnificent fruit that, from the beginning of July, was reaching maturity under that temperature always calculated to replace the heat of the sun, so often absent in our country.
071.011 The countess left Monte Cristo's arm and went to pick a bunch of muscat grapes from a vine.
071.012 "Here, Mr. Count," she said with a smile so sad that one could have seen the tears form at the edge of her eyes, "here, our French grapes are not comparable, I know, to your Sicilian and Cypriot grapes, but you will be indulgent for our poor northern sun.
071.013 The Count bowed, and took a step back.
071.014 "You refuse me?" said Mercedes in a trembling voice.
071.015 --Madam, replied Monte Cristo, I beg you very humbly to excuse me, but I never eat muscatel."
071.016 Mercédès dropped the bunch with a sigh. A magnificent peach hung from a nearby espalier heated, like the vine, by that artificial heat of the greenhouse. Mercédès approached the velvety fruit, and picked it.
071.017 "Take this peach, then," she said.
071.018 But the Count made the same gesture of refusal.
071.019 "Oh, again!" she said with an accent so painful that one felt that this accent was stifling a sob; in truth, I have misfortune."
071.020 A long silence followed this scene; the peach, like the bunch of grapes, had rolled away on the sand.
071.021 "Monsieur le comte," resumed Mercédès at last, looking at Monte Cristo with a pleading eye, "there is a touching Arab custom which makes friends eternally those who have shared bread and salt under the same roof.
071.022 --I know it, madam," replied the Count; "but we are in France and not in Arabia, and in France there are no more eternal friendships than there are sharing salt and bread.
071.023 -But at last," said the Countess, palpitating and with her eyes fixed on the eyes of Monte Cristo, whose arm she almost convulsively grasped again with both hands, "we are friends, are we not?"
071.024 The blood rushed to the Count's heart, and he became pale as death, then, rising from his heart to his throat, it invaded his cheeks, and his eyes swam in a blur for a few seconds, like those of a man struck by a dazzle.
071.025 "Certainly we are friends, madam," he replied; "besides, why shouldn't we be?"
071.026 This tone was so far from that desired by Madame de Morcerf, that she turned to let out a sigh that sounded like a groan.
071.027 "Thank you," she said.
071.028 And she began to walk again. They went around the garden without saying a word.
071.029 "Sir," said the Countess suddenly after ten minutes of silent walking, "is it true that you have seen so much, traveled so much, suffered so much?
071.030 --I have suffered a great deal, yes, madam," replied Monte Cristo.
071.031 --But you are happy now?
071.032 --Surely, replied the Count, for no one hears me complain.
071.033 --And your present happiness makes your soul sweeter?
071.034 -My present happiness equals my past misery, said the Count.
071.035 --Are you not married? asked the Countess.
071.036 --Me, married," replied Monte Cristo, shaking, "who could have told you that?
071.037 -- I have not been told, but several times you have been seen leading a young and beautiful person to the Opera.
071.038 -- She is a slave whom I bought in Constantinople, madam, a prince's daughter whom I have made my daughter, having no other affection in the world.
071.039 -- You live alone like this?
071.040 -- I live alone.
071.041 --You have no sister... no son... no father?
071.042 --I have no one.
071.043 --How can you live like this, without anything to tie you to life?
071.044 --It is not my fault, madam. In Malta, I loved a young girl and I was going to marry her, when the war came and took me away from her like a whirlwind. I had believed that she loved me enough to wait for me, to remain faithful even to my grave. When I returned, she was married. This is the story of every man who has passed through the age of twenty. I was perhaps weaker at heart than the others, and I suffered more than they would have done in my place, that is all."
071.045 The countess paused for a moment, as if she needed the pause to breathe.
071.046 "Yes," she said, "and this love has remained in your heart.... One only loves once.... And did you ever see this woman again?
071.047 -- Never.
071.048 -- Never!
071.049 --I did not return to the country where she was.
071.050 --To Malta?
071.051 -- Yes, to Malta.
071.052 --She is in Malta, then?
071.053 --I think so.
071.054 --And have you forgiven her for what she made you suffer?
071.055 -- For her, yes.
071.056 --But only to her; do you still hate those who separated you from her?"
071.057 The Countess placed herself opposite Monte Cristo, she still held in her hand a fragment of the perfumed bunch.
071.058 "Take it," she said.
071.059 --I never eat muscatel, madam," replied Monte Cristo, as if nothing had been discussed between them on the subject.
071.060 The countess threw the bunch into the nearest bed with a gesture of despair.
071.061 "Inflexible!" she murmured.
071.062 Monte Cristo remained as impassive as if the reproach were not addressed to him. Albert came running at this moment.
071.063 "Oh, my mother," he said, "a great misfortune!
071.064 --What has happened?" asked the Countess, straightening up as if, after the dream, she had been brought to reality: "A misfortune, did you say? Indeed, misfortunes must happen.
071.065 --M. de Villefort is here.
071.066 --Well?
071.067 -- He has come to fetch his wife and daughter.
071.068 --And why is that?
071.069 --Because Mme. de Saint-Méran, the Marquise, has arrived in Paris, bringing the news that M. de Saint-Méran died on leaving Marseilles at the first relay. Mme. de Villefort, who was very cheerful, did not want to understand or believe this misfortune; but Mlle. Valentine, at the first words, and whatever precautions her father took, guessed everything: this blow struck her down like lightning, and she fell unconscious.
071.070 --And what is M. de Saint-Méran to Mlle. de Villefort?
071.071 --His maternal grandfather. He was coming to hasten the marriage of Franz and his granddaughter.
071.072 --Ah, really!
071.073 --Franz is delayed. Why is M. de Saint-Méran not as well a grandfather of Miss Danglars?
071.074 --Albert! I am not sure that I am going to be able to do anything about it, but I am sure that I will. Ah, Monsieur le Comte, you for whom he has such a high regard, tell him that he has spoken badly!"
071.075 She took a few steps forward.
071.076 Monte Cristo looked at her so strangely and with an expression at once so dreamy and so full of affectionate admiration, that she turned back.
071.077 Then she took his hand at the same time as she pressed her son's, and joined them both:
071.078 "We are friends, aren't we?" she said.
071.079 --Oh! your friend, madam, I have no such pretension, said the count; but, in any case, I am your very respectful servant."
071.080 The countess departed with an inexpressible tightness of heart; and before she had taken ten steps, the count saw her put her handkerchief to her eyes.
071.081 "Don't you and my mother agree?" asked Albert in astonishment.
071.082 -On the contrary," replied the Count, "since she has just told me before you that we are friends."
071.083 And they returned to the salon which Valentine and M. and Mme de Villefort had just left. It goes without saying that Morrel had gone out behind them.
072.000 Madame de Saint-Méran.
072.001 A gloomy scene had indeed just taken place in M. de Villefort's house.
072.002 After the departure of the two ladies for the ball, where all the urgings of Mme de Villefort had failed to induce her husband to accompany her, the King's prosecutor had, according to his custom, shut himself up in his study with a pile of files which would have frightened any other, but which, in the ordinary times of his life, were scarcely sufficient to satisfy his robust working appetite.
072.003 But this time the files were a matter of form. Villefort did not lock himself in to work, but to think; and, with his door closed and orders given that he should not be disturbed except for matters of importance, he sat down in his armchair and began to go over once more in his memory all that, for the last seven or eight days, had made the cup of his dark sorrows and bitter memories overflow.
072.004 Then, instead of attacking the files piled up before him, he opened a drawer of his desk, played a secret, and drew out the bundle of his personal notes, precious manuscripts, among which he had classified and labeled with figures known only to himself the names of all those who, in his political career, in his money affairs, in his bar pursuits, or in his mysterious loves, had become his enemies.
072.005 The number of them was so formidable today that he had begun to tremble; and yet, all these names, however powerful and formidable they were, had made him smile many times, as smiles the traveler who, from the culminating peak of the mountain, looks at his feet at the sharp peaks, the impassable paths, and the edges of the precipices near which he has, in order to arrive, crawled so long and so painfully.
072.006 When he had gone over all these names in his memory, when he had reread them well, studied them well, commented on his lists, he shook his head.
072.007 "No," he murmured, "none of these enemies would have waited patiently and laboriously until the day we are, to come and crush me now with this secret. Sometimes, as Hamlet says, the sound of the deepest things comes out of the earth, and, like phosphorus fires, runs madly through the air, but they are flames that light up for a moment to mislead. The story will have been told by the Corsican to some priest, who will have told it in his turn. M. de Monte-Cristo will have read it, and to clarify himself...."
072.008 "But what is the use of clarifying himself?" resumed Villefort after a moment's reflection. What interest does M. de Monte-Cristo, M. Zaccone, son of a shipowner from Malta, exploiter of a silver mine in Thessaly, coming for the first time to France, have in clearing up a dark, mysterious and useless fact like that? In the midst of the incoherent information given to me by this Abbé Busoni and by this Lord Wilmore, by this friend and by this enemy, only one thing stands out clear, precise, patent in my eyes: it is that at no time, in no case, in no circumstance, can there have been the slightest contact between me and him."
072.009 But Villefort said these words to himself without believing himself in what he was saying. The most terrible thing for him was not yet the revelation, for he could deny, or even answer; he cared little for this _Mane, Thecel, Phares_, which suddenly appeared in bloody letters on the wall, but what worried him was to know the body to which belonged the hand that had traced them.
072.010 At the moment when he was trying to reassure himself, and when, instead of that political future which, in his dreams of ambition, he had sometimes glimpsed, he was composing for himself, in fear of awakening this enemy who had been asleep for so long, a future restricted to the joys of the home, a sound of a carriage resounded in the courtyard; then he heard in his staircase the walking of an elderly person, then sobs and alas! such as servants come up with when they want to be made interesting by the grief of their owners.
072.011 He hurried to draw the lock of his cabinet, and soon, without being announced, an old lady entered, her shawl on her arm and her hat in her hand. Her whitened hair uncovered a forehead as dull as yellowed ivory, and her eyes, at the corners of which age had carved deep wrinkles, almost disappeared under the swelling of tears.
072.012 "Oh, sir," she said; "ah, sir, what a misfortune! I too will die of it! oh, yes, certainly I will!"
072.013 And, falling on the armchair nearest the door, she burst into tears.
072.014 The servants, standing on the threshold, and not daring to go any further, looked at Noirtier's old servant, who, having heard this noise from his master's room, had also come running and was standing behind the others. Villefort got up and ran to his mother-in-law, for it was she herself.
072.015 "Eh! mon Dieu! madame," he asked, "what has happened? who is upsetting you like this? and is M. de Saint-Méran not accompanying you?
072.016 --M. de Saint-Méran is dead," said the old marquise, without preamble, without expression, and with a sort of stupor.
072.017 Villefort took a step back and clapped his hands together.
072.018 "Dead!" he stammered; "dead like that... suddenly?
072.019 -- Eight days ago," continued Mme. de Saint-Méran, "we rode together after dinner. M. de Saint-Méran had been unwell for some days: however, the idea of seeing our dear Valentine again made him brave, and in spite of his pains he had wanted to leave, when, six leagues from Marseilles, he was taken, after having eaten his usual pastilles, with a sleep so deep that it did not seem natural to me; however, I hesitated to wake him up, when it seemed to me that his face was reddening and that the veins in his temples were beating more violently than usual. However, as night had come and I could see nothing more, I let him sleep; soon he gave a dull, heart-rending cry like that of a man who suffers in a dream, and with a sudden movement threw his head back. I called the valet, I made the postilion stop, I called M. de Saint-Méran, I made him breathe my bottle of salts, everything was finished, he was dead, and it was side by side with his corpse that I arrived at Aix."
072.020 Villefort remained stunned and with his mouth gaping.
072.021 "And you called a doctor, no doubt?
072.022 -- At once; but, as I told you, it was too late.
072.023 --Surely; but at least he could recognize the disease from which the poor marquis had died.
072.024 --My God! yes, sir, he told me; it seems to have been a lightning stroke.
072.025 --And what did you do then?
072.026 --Mr. de Saint-Méran had always said that, if he died far from Paris, he wanted his body to be brought back to the family vault. I had it put in a lead coffin, and I preceded it by a few days.
072.027 --Oh, my God, poor mother!" said Villefort; "such care after such a blow, and at your age!
072.028 --God gave me strength to the end; besides, this dear marquis would certainly have done for me what I did for him. It is true that since I left him there, I think I am crazy. I cannot cry any more; it is true that they say that at my age one has no more tears; however it seems to me that as long as one suffers one should be able to cry. Where is Valentine, sir? It is for her that we were coming back; I want to see Valentine."
072.029 Villefort thought it would be dreadful to reply that Valentine was at the ball; he only told the marquise that his granddaughter was out with her mother-in-law and that they were going to warn her.
072.030 "At once, sir, at once, I beg you," said the old lady.
072.031 Villefort put Mme de Saint-Méran's arm under his arm and led her to her apartment.
072.032 "Take some rest," he said, "my mother."
072.033 The marquise raised her head at this word, and seeing this man who reminded her of that much-lamented daughter who revived for her in Valentine, she felt struck by this name of mother, burst into tears, and fell on her knees in an armchair where she buried her venerable head.
072.034 Villefort recommended her to the care of the women, while old Barrois went back to his master's house in a fright; for nothing frightens old men so much as when death leaves their side for a moment to strike another old man. Then, while Mme. de Saint-Méran, still kneeling, prayed from the bottom of her heart, he sent for a carriage and came himself to take his wife and daughter from Mme. de Morcerf's house to bring them home. He was so pale when he appeared at the door of the salon that Valentine ran to him, crying out:
072.035 "Oh, my father! something has happened!
072.036 -- "Your good mother has just arrived, Valentine," said M. de Villefort.
072.037 --And my grandfather?" asked the young girl, trembling.
072.038 M. de Villefort only replied by offering his arm to his daughter.
072.039 It was time: Valentine, seized by a dizziness, staggered; Mme de Villefort hastened to support her, and helped her husband to drag her towards the carriage, saying:
072.040 "That is strange! Who could have suspected it? Oh, yes, that is strange!"
072.041 And all this desolate family thus fled, throwing its sadness, like a black crepe, over the rest of the evening.
072.042 At the bottom of the stairs, Valentine found Barrois waiting for her:
072.043 "M. Noirtier wishes to see you this evening," he said softly.
072.044 --Tell him that I will go when I come out of my good grandmother's house," said Valentine.
072.045 In the delicacy of her soul, the young girl had understood that the one who needed her most at this hour was Mme de Saint-Méran.
072.046 Valentine found her grandmother in bed; mute caresses, so painful swelling of the heart, interspersed sighs, burning tears, these were the only recountable details of this interview, which was attended, on the arm of her husband, by Mme de Villefort, full of respect, apparent at least, for the poor widow.
072.047 After a moment, she leaned into her husband's ear:
072.048 "With your permission," she said, "I had better retire, for the sight of me seems to afflict your mother-in-law still."
072.049 Madame de Saint-Méran heard her.
072.050 "Yes, yes," she said in Valentine's ear, "let her go; but stay, you stay."
072.051 Mme de Villefort went out, and Valentine remained alone by the bed of her ancestress, for the king's prosecutor, dismayed at this unexpected death, followed his wife.
072.052 However, Barrois had gone back up to the old Noirtier the first time; the latter had heard all the noise that was being made in the house, and he had sent, as we have said, the old servant to inquire.
072.053 On his return, this eye, so lively and above all so intelligent, questioned the messenger:
072.054 "Alas! sir," said Barrois, "a great misfortune has happened: Mme. de Saint-Méran is here, and her husband is dead."
072.055 M. de Saint-Méran and Noirtier had never been linked by a very deep friendship; however, one knows the effect that the announcement of the death of another old man always has on an old man.
072.056 Noirtier let his head fall on his chest, like an overwhelmed man or a thinking man, and then he closed one eye.
072.057 "Miss Valentine?" said Barrois.
072.058 Noirtier nodded.
072.059 "She is at the ball, Monsieur knows it well, since she came to say good-bye in a grand toilette."
072.060 Noirtier closed his left eye again.
072.061 "Yes, you want to see her?"
072.062 The old man nodded that this was what he wanted.
072.063 "Well, we'll go and get her from Madame de Morcerf's; I'll wait for her when she returns, and I'll tell her to come up to your house. Is that so?
072.064 --Yes," replied the paralytic.
072.065 So Barrois waited for Valentine to return, and as we have seen, when he did, he told him of his grandfather's desire.
072.066 In virtue of this desire, Valentine went up to Noirtier's house after leaving Mme de Saint-Méran's, who, agitated as she was, had finally succumbed to fatigue and was sleeping a feverish sleep.
072.067 A small table with a carafe of orangeade, her usual drink, and a glass was brought within reach of her hand.
072.068 Then, as we said, the girl had left the bed of the marquise to go up to Noirtier.
072.069 Valentine came to embrace the old man, who looked at her so tenderly that the young girl felt tears welling up again from her eyes, the source of which she thought had dried up.
072.070 The old man insisted with his look.
072.071 "Yes, yes," said Valentine, "you mean that I still have a good grandfather, don't you?"
072.072 The old man nodded that indeed that was what his look meant.
072.073 "Alas! fortunately," Valentine continued, "without that, what would become of me, my God?"
072.074 It was one o'clock in the morning. Barrois, who wanted to go to bed himself, remarked that after such a painful evening, everyone needed to rest. The old man did not want to say that his rest to him, it was to see his child. He dismissed Valentine to whom indeed pain and tiredness gave a suffering air.
072.075 The next day, while entering at her grandmother's, Valentine found this one with the bed; the fever had not calmed down; on the contrary, a dark fire shone in the eyes of the old marquise, and she seemed in prey with a violent nervous irritation.
072.076 "Oh, my God! good mother, are you suffering more?" exclaimed Valentine, seeing all these symptoms of agitation.
072.077 -- "No, my daughter, no," said Madame de Saint-Méran; "but I was impatiently waiting for you to arrive so that I could send for your father.
072.078 --My father? asked Valentine, worried.
072.079 --Yes, I want to talk to him."
072.080 Valentine did not dare to oppose the desire of her grandmother, the cause of which she did not know, and a moment later Villefort entered.
072.081 "Sir," said Mme. de Saint-Méran, without using any circumlocution, and as if she had seemed to fear that time was running out for her, "did you write me about a marriage for this child?
072.082 -- Yes, madame," replied Villefort; "it is more than a project, it is an agreement.
072.083 --Your son-in-law is called M. Franz d'Épinay?
072.084 -- Yes, madame.
072.085 --This is the son of General d'Épinay, who was one of us, and who was assassinated a few days before the usurper returned from the island of Elba?
072.086 --That's it.
072.087 --Doesn't this alliance with the granddaughter of a Jacobin repulse him?
072.088 --Our civil dissensions have fortunately died out, my mother," said Villefort; "M. d'Épinay was almost a child when his father died; he knows very little of M. Noirtier, and will see him, if not with pleasure, at least with indifference
072.089 --Is this a feasible party?
072.090 --In every respect.
072.091 --The young man...?
072.092 --Enjoys the general consideration.
072.093 --Is he suitable?
072.094 --He is one of the most distinguished men I know."
072.095 During this entire conversation, Valentine had remained mute.
072.096 "Well, sir," said Mme. de Saint-Méran, after a few seconds of reflection, "you must make haste, for I have little time to live.
072.097 --You, madame! you, good mother!" cried M. de Villefort and Valentine.
072.098 --I know what I am saying," resumed the marquise, "so you must hasten, so that, having no mother, she may at least have her grandmother to bless her marriage. I am the only one who remains for her on the side of my poor Renee, whom you have so quickly forgotten, sir.
072.099 --Ah, madame," said Villefort, "you forget that it was necessary to give a mother to this poor child who had none left.
072.100 --A stepmother is never a mother, monsieur! But that's not what it's about, it's about Valentine; let's leave the dead alone."
072.101 All this was said with such volubility and accent, that there was something in this conversation that resembled the beginning of delirium.
072.102 "It will be done according to your wish, madame," said Villefort, "and all the better for your wish being in accord with mine; and, as soon as M. d'Épinay arrived in Paris....
072.103 --My good mother, said Valentine, propriety, the recent mourning... would you then want to make a marriage under such sad auspices?
072.104 --My daughter," interrupted the grandmother, "none of those banal reasons which prevent weak minds from building a solid future. I, too, was married at my mother's deathbed, and was certainly not unhappy for that.
072.105 -- Still this idea of death!
072.106 -- Again! always! I tell you that I am going to die, do you hear? Well, before I die, I want to have seen my son-in-law; I want to order him to make my granddaughter happy; I want to read in his eyes whether he intends to obey me; I want to know him at last!" continued the grandmother with a frightened expression, "to come and find him from the depths of my tomb if he were not what he should be, if he were not what he should be.
072.107 --Madame, said Villefort, you must keep away from these exalted ideas, which almost touch madness. The dead, once laid in their graves, sleep there without ever rising again.
072.108 --Oh, yes, yes, good mother, calm yourself!
072.109 -- And I, sir, tell you that it is not so as you think. Last night I slept a terrible sleep; for I saw myself sleeping as if my soul had already hovered above my body: My eyes, which I tried to open, closed in spite of myself; and yet I know that this will seem impossible to you, especially to you, sir; well, with my eyes closed, I saw, at the very place where you are, coming from that corner where there is a door which leads into Mme. de Villefort's toilet, I saw a white form enter without a sound.
072.110 Valentine gave a shout.
072.111 "It was the fever that agitated you, madame," said Villefort.
072.112 --Doubt if you want, but I am sure of what I am saying: I saw a white form; and as if God had feared that I would challenge the testimony of only one of my senses, I heard my glass being stirred, here, here, the very one that is here, there, on the table.
072.113 --Oh, good mother, it was a dream.
072.114 -It was so little a dream that I stretched out my hand towards the bell, and at that gesture the shadow disappeared. The maid then entered with a light. Ghosts only show themselves to those who must see them: it was the soul of my husband. Well, if my husband's soul returns to call me, why shouldn't my soul return to defend my daughter? The connection is even more direct, it seems to me.
072.115 --Oh, madame," said Villefort, moved in spite of himself to the depths of his bowels, "don't give vent to these gloomy ideas; you will live with us, you will live a long time happy, loved, honored, and we will make you forget....
072.116 --Never! never! never! said the marquise. When does M. d'Épinay return?
072.117 --We are expecting him any moment.
072.118 --That's good; as soon as he arrives, let me know. Let's hurry, let's hurry. Then I would also like to see a notary to make sure that all our property goes to Valentine.
072.119 --Oh, my mother," murmured Valentine, pressing her lips to the shining forehead of her grandmother, "do you want me to die? My God! you have the fever. It is not a notary who should be called, but a doctor!
072.120 -A doctor? she said, shrugging her shoulders, I'm not suffering; I'm just thirsty.
072.121 -- What are you drinking, good mother?
072.122 --As always, you know, my orangeade. My glass is there on that table, pass it to me, Valentine."
072.123 Valentine poured the orangeade from the decanter into the glass and took it with some fright to give it to her grandmother, for it was this very glass which she claimed had been touched by the shadow.
072.124 The marquise emptied the glass in one gulp.
072.125 Then she turned over on her pillow and repeated:
072.126 "The notary! The notary!"
072.127 M. de Villefort went out. Valentine sat down by her grandmother's bed. The poor child seemed to be in great need of this doctor whom she had recommended to her grandmother. A redness like a flame burned the cheekbone of her cheeks, her breathing was short and panting, and her pulse was beating as if she had a fever.
072.128 The poor child thought of Maximilian's despair when he learned that Madame de Saint-Méran, instead of being his ally, was acting without knowing him, as if she were his enemy.
072.129 More than once Valentine had thought of telling her grandmother everything, and she would not have hesitated for a moment if Maximilien Morrel had been called Albert de Morcerf or Raoul de Château-Renaud; but Morrel was of plebeian extraction, and Valentine knew the contempt which the proud Marquise de Saint-Méran had for everything that was not of race. Her secret had therefore always, at the moment when it was about to come to light, been pushed back into her heart by the sad certainty that she would deliver it in vain, and that once this secret was known to her father and her mother-in-law, all would be lost.
072.130 Two hours or so passed in this manner. Mme. de Saint-Méran slept an ardent and restless sleep. The notary was announced.
072.131 Although this announcement was made very low, Mme. de Saint-Méran raised herself on her pillow.
072.132 "The notary?" she said; "let him come, let him come!
072.133 The notary was at the door; he entered.
072.134 "Go away, Valentine," said Madame de Saint-Méran, "and leave me with the gentleman.
072.135 --But, my mother....
072.136 --Go, go."
072.137 The young girl kissed her grandmother on the forehead and went out, with her handkerchief over her eyes. At the door she found the valet, who told her that the doctor was waiting in the living room. Valentine went downstairs quickly. The doctor was a friend of the family, and at the same time one of the most skilful men of the time: he loved Valentine very much, whom he had seen come into the world. He had a daughter about the age of Mlle. de Villefort, but born of a mother with a heart condition; his life was one of continual fear with regard to his child.
072.138 "Oh!" said Valentine, "dear Monsieur d'Avrigny, we have been waiting for you with great impatience. But first of all, how are Madeleine and Antoinette?"
072.139 Madeleine was the daughter of M. d'Avrigny, and Antoinette his niece.
072.140 M. d'Avrigny smiled sadly.
072.141 "Very well, Antoinette," he said; "quite well, Madeleine. But you sent for me, dear child? It is neither your father nor Mme de Villefort who is ill? As for us, though it is visible that we cannot get rid of our nerves, I do not presume you need me otherwise than that I should recommend you not to let our imagination beat the field too much?"
072.142 Valentine blushed; M. d'Avrigny pushed the science of divination almost to the point of miracle, for he was one of those doctors who always treat the physical by the moral.
072.143 "No," she said, "it is for my poor grandmother. You know the misfortune that has befallen us, don't you?
072.144 --I know nothing, said d'Avrigny.
072.145 -- Alas!" said Valentine, compressing her sobs, "my grandfather is dead.
072.146 --M. de Saint-Méran?
072.147 --Yes.
072.148 --Subtly?
072.149 --From a lightning stroke.
072.150 --Apoplexy? repeated the doctor.
072.151 --Yes. So that my poor grandmother is struck with the idea that her husband, whom she had never left, is calling her, and that she is going to join him. Oh, Mr. d'Avrigny, I recommend my poor grandmother to you!
072.152 --Where is she?
072.153 -- In her room with the notary.
072.154 --And Mr. Noirtier?
072.155 --Still the same, a perfect lucidity of mind, but the same immobility, the same mutism.
072.156 --And the same love for you, isn't it, my dear child?
072.157 -- Yes," said Valentine, sighing, "he loves me well.
072.158 --Who wouldn't love you?"
072.159 Valentine smiled sadly.
072.160 "And how does your grandmother feel?
072.161 --Singular nervous excitement, a restless and strange sleep; she claimed this morning that, while she slept, her soul hovered above her body, which she watched sleeping: this is delirium; she claims to have seen a ghost enter her room and to have heard the noise the so-called ghost made when it touched her glass.
072.162 -It is singular, said the doctor, I did not know Mme de Saint-Méran prone to these hallucinations.
072.163 --This is the first time I have seen her like this, said Valentine, and this morning she gave me a great fright, I thought she was crazy; and my father, certainly, Mr. d'Avrigny, you know my father for a serious mind, well, my father himself seemed very impressed.
072.164 --We'll see," said M. d'Avrigny; "what you're telling me now seems strange to me."
072.165 The notary came downstairs; Valentine was told that her grandmother was alone.
072.166 "Go upstairs," she said to the doctor.
072.167 --And you?
072.168 --Oh! I don't dare, she had forbidden me to send for you; then, as you say, I myself am agitated, feverish, ill-at-ease, I am going to take a walk in the garden to recover."
072.169 The doctor shook hands with Valentine, and as he went up to his grandmother's house, the girl came down the stoop.
072.170 We need not say what portion of the garden was Valentine's favorite walk. After having made two or three turns in the flowerbed which surrounded the house, after having picked a rose to put at her belt or in her hair, she sank under the dark alley which led to the bench, then from the bench she went to the gate.
072.171 This time Valentine made, according to her habit, two or three turns among her flowers, but without picking any: the mourning of her heart, which had not yet had time to spread over her person, repelled this simple ornament, and then she moved towards her alley. As she advanced, she seemed to hear a voice pronouncing her name. She stopped in astonishment.
072.172 Then the voice came more distinctly to her ear, and she recognized the voice of Maximilian.
073.000 The promise.
073.001 It was indeed Morrel, who since the day before had not lived. With that instinct peculiar to lovers and mothers, he had guessed that, following this return of Mme de Saint-Méran and the death of the Marquis, something would happen at Villefort's house that would interest his love for Valentine.
073.002 As we shall see, his presentiments had come true, and it was no longer a simple anxiety that led him so frightened and trembling to the chestnut tree gate.
073.003 But Valentine had not been warned of Morrel's expectation, it was not the hour when he usually came, and it was pure chance or, if one likes better, a happy sympathy that led her to the garden. When she appeared, Morrel called her; she ran to the gate.
073.004 "You, at this hour!" she said.
073.005 --Yes, poor friend," replied Morrel, "I have come to seek and bring bad news.
073.006 --So this is the house of misfortune, said Valentine. Speak, Maximilian. But, in truth, the sum of sorrows is already quite enough.
073.007 --Dear Valentine, said Morrel, trying to recover from his own emotion to speak properly, listen to me well, I pray you; for all I am going to tell you is solemn. At what time are you to be married?
073.008 --Listen," said Valentine in turn, "I don't want to hide anything from you, Maximilian. This morning there was talk of my marriage, and my grandmother, on whom I had counted as on a support that would not be lacking, not only declared herself in favor of this marriage, but also desired it to such an extent that the return of M. d'Épinay alone delays it, and that the day after his arrival the contract will be signed."
073.009 A painful sigh opened the young man's chest, and he looked long and sadly at the girl.
073.010 "Alas!" he resumed in a low voice, "it is dreadful to hear the woman one loves say quietly, 'The time of your torture is fixed: it is in a few hours that it will take place; but no matter, it must be so, and on my part I shall make no opposition to it." Well, since, you say, we are only waiting for M. d'Épinay to sign the contract, since you will be his the day after his arrival, it is tomorrow that you will be engaged to M. d'Épinay, for he arrived in Paris this morning."
073.011 Valentine gave a cry.
073.012 "I was at the Count of Monte Cristo's an hour ago," said Morrel; "we were talking, he of the sorrow of your house and I of your sorrow, when suddenly a carriage rolled into the court. Listen. Until then I did not believe in presentiments, Valentine; but now I must believe them. At the sound of that carriage, a shiver took me; soon I heard footsteps on the stairs. The resounding footsteps of the commander did not frighten Don Juan any more than these footsteps frightened me. At last the door opened; Albert de Morcerf entered first, and I was about to doubt myself, I was about to believe that I had been mistaken, when behind him another young man advanced and the count cried out, "Ah! M. le baron Franz d'Épinay!" All that I have of strength and courage in my heart I called upon him to restrain me. Perhaps I paled, perhaps I trembled: but for sure I remained with a smile on my lips. But five minutes later, I left without having heard a word of what was said during those five minutes; I was devastated.
073.013 --Poor Maximilian!" murmured Valentine.
073.014 -Here I am, Valentine. Let's see, now answer me as to a man to whom your answer will give death or life. What do you intend to do?"
073.015 Valentine bowed her head; she was overwhelmed.
073.016 "Listen," said Morrel, "this is not the first time you have thought of the situation in which we have arrived: it is grave, it is heavy, supreme. I do not think that this is the time to abandon oneself to a sterile pain: that is good for those who want to suffer at ease and drink their tears at leisure. There are people like that, and God will undoubtedly account to them in heaven for their resignation on earth; but whoever feels the will to fight does not waste precious time and immediately returns the blow to fortune. Is it your will to fight against bad fortune, Valentine? Say, for that is what I have come to ask you."
073.017 Valentine flinched and looked at Morrel with great frightened eyes. This idea of resisting her father, her grandmother, her whole family, had not even occurred to her.
073.018 "What are you telling me, Maximilien?" asked Valentine, "and what do you call a struggle? Oh, call it a sacrilege. What! I would fight against my father's order, against the wish of my dying grandmother! It is impossible!"
073.019 Morrel made a movement.
073.020 "You are too noble a heart not to understand me, and you understand me so well, dear Maximilian, that I see you reduced to silence. Fighting, me! God forbid! No, no; I keep all my strength to fight against myself and to drink my tears, as you say. As for afflicting my father, as for disturbing the last moments of my grandmother, never!
073.021 --You are quite right, said Morrel phlegmatically.
073.022 --How you say that to me, my God! cried Valentine hurt.
073.023 --I tell you this as a man who admires you, mademoiselle," continued Maximilien.
073.024 --Mademoiselle!" cried Valentine, "mademoiselle! Oh, the egotist! he sees me in despair and pretends not to understand me.
073.025 --You are mistaken, and I understand you perfectly on the contrary. You don't want to upset M. de Villefort, you don't want to disobey the Marquise, and tomorrow you will sign the contract that must bind you to your husband.
073.026 -But, my God! Can I do otherwise?
073.027 --You must not appeal to me, mademoiselle, for I am a bad judge in this cause, and my selfishness will blind me, answered Morrel, whose dull voice and closed fists announced his growing exasperation.
073.028 --What would you have proposed to me, Morrel, if you had found me willing to accept your proposal? Let us see, answer. It is not a question of saying you are doing wrong, it is necessary to give advice.
073.029 --Are you seriously telling me this, Valentine, and should I give it, this advice? say.
073.030 --Certainly, dear Maximilian, for if it is good, I will follow it; you know well that I am devoted to your affections.
073.031 --Valentine," said Morrel, as he finished pushing aside a board that was already disjointed, "give me your hand as proof that you forgive me my anger; it is that my head is upset, you see, and that for an hour the most insane ideas have been passing through my mind in turn. Oh! in case you refuse my advice!
073.032 --Well, what advice?
073.033 -Here it is, Valentine."
073.034 The girl raised her eyes to heaven and sighed.
073.035 "I am free," said Maximilian, "I am rich enough for both of us; I swear to you that you will be my wife before my lips have rested on your forehead.
073.036 --You make me tremble, said the girl.
073.037 --Follow me, continued Morrel; I will take you to my sister, who is worthy to be your sister; we will embark for Algiers, for England, or for America, if you do not prefer to retire together to some province, where we will wait, to return to Paris, until our friends have overcome the resistance of your family."
073.038 Valentine shook his head.
073.039 "I expected it, Maximilian," she said: "it is a fool's advice, and I would be even more foolish than you if I did not stop you at once with this one word: impossible, Morrel, impossible.
073.040 --You will therefore follow your fortune, as fate will have it, and without even trying to fight it?
073.041 --Yes, even if I die!
073.042 --Well, Valentine," said Maximilian, "I'll tell you again that you are right. Indeed, it is I who am a fool, and you prove to me that passion blinds the most just minds. Thank you then, to you who reason without passion. Tomorrow you will be irrevocably promised to Mr. Franz d'Épinay, not by that theatrical formality invented to unravel comedy plays, and which is called the signing of the contract, but by your own will.
073.043 -- Once again, you despair of me, Maximilien! said Valentine; once again, you turn the dagger in the wound! What would you do, if your sister listened to advice like that which you give me?
073.044 --Mademoiselle," said Morrel with a bitter smile, "I am an egoist, as you have said, and in my capacity as an egoist I do not think of what others in my position would do, but of what I intend to do, myself. I think that I have known you for a year, that from the day I met you I put all my chances of happiness on your love, that a day came when you told me you loved me; that from that day I put all my chances of the future on your possession: that was my life. I don't think anything more now; I only tell myself that the odds have turned, that I thought I had won heaven and that I lost it. It happens every day that a gambler loses not only what he has, but also what he does not have."
073.045 Morrel pronounced these words with perfect calm; Valentine looked at him for a moment with his large scrutinizing eyes, trying not to let Morrel's penetrate to the turmoil that was already swirling in the depths of his heart.
073.046 "But finally, what are you going to do?" asked Valentine.
073.047 --I am going to have the honor of bidding you farewell, mademoiselle, by attesting to God, who hears my words and reads the depths of my heart, that I wish you a life that is calm enough, happy enough, and full enough for there to be no room for my memory.
073.048 --Oh! murmured Valentine.
073.049 --Farewell, Valentine, farewell! said Morrel, bowing.
073.050 --Where are you going?" cried the young girl, stretching out her hand through the gate and seizing Maximilian by his robe, who understood from her inner agitation that her lover's calm could not be real; "where are you going?
073.051 -- I am going to take care not to bring a new disturbance into your family, and to give an example which all the honest and devoted men who will find themselves in my position can follow.
073.052 --Before you leave me, tell me what you are going to do, Maximilian?"
073.053 The young man smiled sadly.
073.054 "Oh, speak, speak!" said Valentine, "I beg you!
073.055 --Has your resolution changed, Valentine?
073.056 --It cannot change, unhappy man! You know it well!" cried the young girl.
073.057 --Then, farewell, Valentine!"
073.058 Valentine shook the grate with a strength of which one would have thought her incapable; and as Morrel moved away, she passed her two hands through the grate, and joined them by twisting her arms:
073.059 "What are you going to do? I want to know!" she cried; "where are you going?
073.060 --Oh, be quiet," said Maximilian, stopping three paces from the door, "my intention is not to make another man responsible for the rigors that fate keeps for me. Another would threaten you to go to Mr. Franz, to provoke him, to fight with him, all that would be foolish. What does Mr. Franz have to do with all this? He saw me this morning for the first time, he has already forgotten that he saw me; he didn't even know that I existed when the agreements made by your two families decided that you would be one to the other. So I have no business with Mr. Franz, and, I swear to you, I will not take it out on him.
073.061 --But who will you take it out on? on me?
073.062 -- At you, Valentine! Oh, God forbid! The woman is sacred; the woman one loves is holy.
073.063 -- To yourself then, unhappy man, to yourself?
073.064 -I am the guilty one, am I not? said Morrel.
073.065 --Maximilian, said Valentine, Maximilian, come here, I want you to!"
073.066 Maximilien approached with his sweet smile, and, but for his pallor, one would have thought him in his ordinary state.
073.067 "Listen to me, my dear, my beloved Valentine," he said in his melodious, low voice, "people like us, who have never formed a thought of which they had to be ashamed before the world, before their parents, and before God, people like us can read each other's hearts with an open book. I have never made a novel, I am not a melancholic hero, I do not pose as Manfred or Antony: but without words, without protests, without oaths, I have put my life in you; I miss you and you are right to do so, I have told you and I repeat it; but finally I miss you and my life is lost. From the moment you leave me, Valentine, I am alone in the world. My sister is happy near her husband; her husband is only my brother-in-law, that is to say a man whom social conventions alone attach to me; no one on earth needs my now useless existence. This is what I will do: I will wait until the last second that you are married, because I do not want to lose the shadow of one of those unexpected chances that chance sometimes keeps for us, because finally between now and then M. Franz d'Épinay can die, at the moment when you approach him, lightning can fall on the altar: everything seems believable to the condemned to death, and for him miracles enter the class of the possible as soon as it is a question of the salvation of his life. I will wait, therefore, I say, until the last moment, and when my misfortune is certain, without remedy, without hope, I will write a confidential letter to my brother-in-law, another to the Prefect of Police to give him notice of my purpose, and at the corner of some wood, on the reverse side of some ditch, on the bank of some river, I will blow my brains out, as true as I am the son of the most honest man who ever lived in France."
073.068 A convulsive tremor agitated Valentine's limbs; she let go of the gate which she held with both hands, her arms fell back to her sides, and two large tears rolled down her cheeks.
073.069 The young man remained in front of her, dark and resolved.
073.070 "Oh, for pity's sake, for pity's sake," she said, "you will live, won't you?
073.071 --No, on my honor," said Maximilian; "but what does it matter to you? You will have done your duty, and your conscience will remain with you."
073.072 Valentine fell on his knees, embracing his heart, which was breaking.
073.073 "Maximilian," she said, "Maximilian, my friend, my brother on earth, my true husband in heaven, I beg you, do as I do, live with suffering: one day perhaps we shall be reunited.
073.074 --Farewell, Valentine! repeated Morrel.
073.075 --My God! said Valentine, raising her two hands to heaven with a sublime expression, you see, I have done all I could to remain a submissive daughter: I have prayed, begged, implored; he has listened neither to my prayers, nor to my supplications, nor to my cries. Well," she continued, wiping her tears and regaining her firmness, "I don't want to die of remorse, I'd rather die of shame. You will live, Maximilian, and I will belong to no one but to you. At what time? at what moment? is it at once? speak, order, I am ready."
073.076 Morrel, who had again taken a few steps to go away, had returned again, and, pale with joy, with a blooming heart, stretching through the gate his two hands to Valentine:
073.077 "Valentine," he said, "dear friend, this is not the way to speak to me, or else you must let me die. Why then should I owe you violence, if you love me as I love you? Are you forcing me to live out of humanity, that's all? In that case I would rather die.
073.078 --Actually, Valentine murmured, who in the world loves me? Who has consoled me for all my pains? On whom do my hopes rest, on whom does my lost sight stop, on whom does my bleeding heart rest? on him, him, always him. Well, you are right in your turn; Maximilian, I will follow you, I will leave my father's house, everything. O ungrateful one!" cried Valentine, sobbing, "everything!... even my good grandfather, whom I had forgotten!
073.079 -- No," said Maximilien, "you will not leave him. I have been told that I am a man of the cloth, and that I am a man of the cloth, and that I am a man of the cloth, and that I am a man of the cloth. You told me how he spoke to you and how you answered him; I will soon learn this touching language of signs, go, Valentine. Oh, I swear to you, instead of the despair that awaits us, it is happiness that I promise you!
073.080 --Oh, look, Maximilian, look what power you have over me, you almost make me believe what you tell me, and yet what you tell me is foolish, for my father will curse me; for I know him, the inflexible heart, he will never forgive. So listen to me, Maximilian, if by trickery, by prayer, by accident, what do I know? if at last by some means I can delay the marriage, you will wait, will you not?
073.081 -- Yes, I swear it, just as you swear to me that this dreadful marriage will never take place, and that, dragged before the magistrate, before the priest, you will say no.
073.082 --I swear to you, Maximilian, by the most sacred thing in the world, by my mother!
073.083 --Let us wait then, said Morrel.
073.084 --Yes, let us wait," said Valentine, who breathed at this word; "there are so many things that can save unfortunate people like us.
073.085 --I trust you, Valentine, said Morrel, whatever you do will be well done; only, if your prayers are overruled, if your father, if Mme de Saint-Méran demand that M. Franz d'Épinay be called tomorrow to sign the contract....
073.086 --Then you have my word, Morrel.
073.087 --Instead of signing....
073.088 --I am coming to join you and we are fleeing: but until then, let us not tempt God, Morrel; let us not see each other: it is a miracle, it is a providence that we have not yet been surprised; if we were surprised, if it were known how we see each other, we would have no more resources.
073.089 --You are right, Valentine; but how to know....
073.090 --Through the notary, Mr. Deschamps.
073.091 --I know him.
073.092 --And by myself. I will write to you, believe it or not. My God! This marriage, Maximilian, is as hateful to me as it is to you!
073.093 --Well, well! thank you, my beloved Valentine," said Morrel. I am not a man of the world, but a man of the world, a man of the world, a man of the world, a man of the world, a man of the world, a man of the world, a man of the world, a man of the world, a man of the world, a man of the world, a man of the world, a man of the world, a man of the world, a man of the world, a man of the world, a man of the world, a man of the world, a man of the world, a man of the world, a man of the world, a man of the world, a man of the world, a man of the world, a man of the world, a man of the world.
073.094 --So be it, said Valentine; in your turn I will tell you: Maximilian, what you do will be well done.
073.095 --Oh!
073.096 --Well, are you happy with your wife? said the girl sadly.
073.097 --My beloved Valentine, it is an understatement to say yes.
073.098 --Say always."
073.099 Valentine had approached, or rather had brought her lips close to the grate, and her words slid, with her perfumed breath, to Morrel's lips, who stuck his mouth on the other side of the cold and inexorable fence.
073.100 "Good-bye," said Valentine, tearing herself away from this happiness, "good-bye!
073.101 --I will have a letter from you?
073.102 --Yes.
073.103 --Thank you, dear wife! Good-bye."
073.104 The sound of an innocent and lost kiss rang out, and Valentine fled under the lime trees.
073.105 Morrel listened to the last sounds of her dress brushing the bowers, of her feet making the sand cry out, raised her eyes to heaven with an ineffable smile to thank heaven for allowing him to be loved like this, and disappeared in his turn.
073.106 The young man went home and waited for the rest of the evening and all day the next day without receiving anything. Finally, it was only the next day, around ten o'clock in the morning, as he was on his way to Mr. Deschamps, notary, that he received a small bill in the mail which he recognized as being from Valentine, although he had never seen her handwriting.
073.107 It was written in these words:
073.108 "Tears, supplications, prayers, have done nothing. Yesterday, for two hours, I went to the church of St. Philip of the Rolls, and for two hours I prayed to God from the bottom of my soul, God is as insensitive as men, and the signing of the contract is set for tonight, nine o'clock.
073.109 "I have only one word as I have only one heart, Morrel, and this word is committed to you: this heart is yours!
073.110 "Tonight then, at a quarter to nine, at the gate.
073.111 "Your wife, Valentine de Villefort.
073.112 P.-S.--"My poor grandmother is getting worse and worse; yesterday her exaltation became delirium: today her delirium is almost madness.
073.113 "You will like me, won't you, Morrel, to make me forget that I have left her in this state?
073.114 "I think we're hiding from Grandpa Noirtier that the signing of the contract is to take place this evening."
073.115 Morrel did not confine himself to the information Valentine gave him; he went to the notary's office, who confirmed to him the news that the signing of the contract was for nine o'clock in the evening.
073.116 Then he went to Monte Cristo's house; it was there again that he knew the most: Franz had come to announce this solemnity to him; for her part, Mme. de Villefort had written to the Count to ask him to excuse her if she did not invite him; but the death of M. de Saint-Méran and the state in which his widow found herself cast a veil of sadness over this meeting, which she did not want to cloud the Count's forehead, to whom she wished every happiness.
073.117 The day before, Franz had been presented to Mme. de Saint-Méran, who had left the bed for this presentation, and who had returned to it at once.
073.118 Morrel, it is easy to understand, was in a state of agitation which could not escape an eye as sharp as the Count's, so Monte Cristo was more affectionate for him than ever; so affectionate, that two or three times Maximilian was about to tell him everything. But he remembered the formal promise given to Valentine, and his secret remained in his heart.
073.119 The young man reread Valentine's letter twenty times during the day. It was the first time she had written to him, and what an occasion! Each time he reread this letter, Maximilian renewed to himself the oath to make Valentine happy. Indeed, what authority does not the young girl have who takes such a courageous resolution! What devotion does she not deserve from the one to whom she has sacrificed everything! How she must be really for her lover the first and most worthy object of his worship! She is both queen and wife, and one does not have enough of a soul to thank and love her.
073.120 Morrel thought with inexpressible agitation of that moment when Valentine would arrive and say:
073.121 "Here I am, Maximilian; take me."
073.122 He had organized the whole escape; two ladders had been hidden in the alfalfa of the enclosure; a cabriolet, which Maximilien himself was to drive, was waiting; no servant, no light; at the bend in the first street lanterns would be lighted, for it was not necessary, by an extra precaution, to fall into the hands of the police.
073.123 From time to time shivers passed through Morrel's whole body; he thought of the moment when, from the top of this wall, he would protect Valentine's descent, and when he would feel trembling and abandoned in his arms the one whose hand he had never pressed and whose fingertip he had never kissed.
073.124 But when the afternoon came, when Morrel felt the hour approaching, he felt the need to be alone; his blood boiled, the simple questions, the only voice of a friend would have irritated him; he shut himself up at home, trying to read; but his gaze slipped over the pages without understanding anything, and he ended up throwing his book away, to return to drawing, for the second time, his plan, his ladders and his clos.
073.125 Finally the hour approached.
073.126 Never has a man in love let the clocks run their course peacefully; Morrel tormented his so well that they ended up marking eight thirty at six o'clock. He then said to himself that it was time to leave, that nine o'clock was indeed the hour of the signing of the contract, but that, in all probability, Valentine would not wait for this useless signing; consequently, Morrel, after having left the rue Meslay at half past eight at his clock, entered the clos as eight o'clock struck at Saint-Philippe-du-Roule.
073.127 The horse and the cabriolet were hidden behind a small ruined house in which Morrel used to hide.
073.128 Little by little the day fell, and the foliage of the garden gathered in large clumps of opaque black.
073.129 Then Morrel came out of his hiding place and looked, with a throbbing heart, at the hole in the gate: there was still no one there.
073.130 Half past eight sounded.
073.131 Half an hour passed in waiting; Morrel walked up and down, then, at ever closer intervals, came to apply his eye to the boards. The garden darkened more and more; but in the darkness one sought in vain the white dress; in the silence one listened uselessly to the noise of the steps.
073.132 The house that could be seen through the foliage remained dark, and had none of the characteristics of a house that opens for an event as important as a signing of a marriage contract.
073.133 Morrel consulted his watch, which struck three-quarters past nine; but almost immediately the same voice of the clock, already heard two or three times, corrected the error of the watch by striking half past nine.
073.134 It was already half an hour longer than Valentine had set herself: she had said nine o'clock, even before rather than after.
073.135 This was the most terrible moment for the young man's heart, on which every second fell like a lead hammer.
073.136 The faintest sound of the foliage, the slightest cry of the wind called to his ear and made the sweat rise to his brow; then, shivering, he secured his ladder and, in order not to lose time, put his foot on the first rung.
073.137 In the midst of these alternations of fear and hope, in the midst of these dilations and tightenings of the heart, ten o'clock sounded in the church.
073.138 "Oh!" murmured Maximilian in terror, "it is impossible that the signing of a contract should last so long, unless unforeseen events occur; I have weighed all the chances, calculated the time that all the formalities last, something has happened."
073.139 And then, sometimes he walked restlessly before the gate, sometimes he returned to press his burning forehead against the icy iron. Had Valentine fainted after the contract, or had Valentine been arrested in his flight? These were the only two hypotheses where the young man could stop, both hopeless.
073.140 The idea he came to was that in the midst of her flight even Valentine had lost her strength, and that she had fallen unconscious in the middle of some alley.
073.141 "Oh, if that is so," he cried, dashing to the top of the ladder, "I shall lose her, and by my own fault!"
073.142 The demon that had breathed this thought into him never left him, and buzzed in his ear with that persistence which makes certain doubts, after a moment, by force of reasoning, become convictions. His eyes, seeking to pierce the growing darkness, thought they saw some object lying under the dark alley; Morrel ventured to call out, and it seemed to him that the wind was bringing to him an inarticulate complaint.
073.143 At last half past the hour had sounded in its turn; it was impossible to stay any longer, everything was supposable; Maximilian's temples were pounding, clouds were passing before his eyes; he stepped over the wall and jumped to the other side.
073.144 He was in Villefort's house, he had just climbed in; he thought of the consequences that such an action might have, but he had not come this far to back down.
073.145 In an instant he was at the end of this massif. From the point where he had reached the house was visible.
073.146 Then Morrel became sure of something he had already suspected while trying to slide his gaze through the trees: that instead of the lights he thought he saw shining in every window, as is natural on ceremonial days, he saw nothing but the gray mass, still veiled by a great curtain of shadow cast by a huge cloud spread over the moon.
073.147 A light ran from time to time as if distraught, and passed in front of three windows of the second floor. These three windows were those of the apartment of Mme. de Saint-Méran.
073.148 Another light remained motionless behind red curtains. These curtains were those of Mme de Villefort's bedroom.
073.149 Morrel guessed all this. So many times, in order to follow Valentine in his thoughts at all hours of the day, so many times, shall we say, he had made a plan of this house, that, without having seen it, he knew it.
073.150 The young man was even more frightened by this darkness and silence than he had been by Valentine's absence.
073.151 Distraught, mad with grief, determined to brave everything to see Valentine again and to make sure of the misfortune he foresaw, whatever it might be, Morrel gained the edge of the massif, and was about to cross the completely uncovered parterre as quickly as possible, when the sound of a voice, still quite distant, but which the wind brought to him, reached him.
073.152 At this sound he took a step backward, already half out of the foliage, he sank into it completely and remained motionless and mute, buried in its darkness.
073.153 His mind was made up: if it was Valentine alone, he would warn her with a word as he passed; if Valentine was accompanied, he would at least see her and make sure that no harm had come to her; if they were strangers, he would catch a few words of their conversation and come to understand this mystery, incomprehensible until then.
073.154 Then the moon came out of the cloud that hid it, and on the door of the stoop Morrel saw Villefort appear, followed by a man dressed in black. They descended the steps and advanced towards the massif. They had not taken four steps when Morrel recognized Dr. d'Avrigny in the man dressed in black.
073.155 The young man, seeing them coming towards him, mechanically backed up in front of them until he came upon the trunk of a sycamore tree which formed the center of the massif; there he was forced to stop.
073.156 Soon the sand ceased to cry out under the steps of the two walkers.
073.157 "Ah, dear doctor," said the king's prosecutor, "here is Heaven declaring itself decidedly against my house. What a horrible death! What a thunderbolt! Do not try to console me; alas, the wound is too sharp and too deep! Dead, dead!"
073.158 A cold sweat chilled the young man's forehead and made his teeth chatter. Who had died in this house that Villefort himself said was cursed?
073.159 "My dear Monsieur de Villefort," replied the doctor, with an accent that redoubled the young man's terror, "I have not brought you here to console you, on the contrary.
073.160 --What do you mean?" asked the king's prosecutor, startled.
073.161 -- I mean that, behind the misfortune that has just befallen you, there is another, perhaps even greater.
073.162 --Oh, my God!" murmured Villefort, joining his hands, "what else are you going to tell me?
073.163 --Are we alone, my friend?
073.164 --Oh, yes, quite alone. But what do all these precautions mean?
073.165 --They mean that I have a terrible confidence to make to you, said the doctor: let us sit down."
073.166 Villefort fell rather than sat down on a bench. The doctor remained standing in front of him, one hand resting on his shoulder. Morrel, frozen with fright, held his forehead with one hand, and with the other compressed his heart, whose beating he feared could be heard.
073.167 "Dead, dead!" he repeated in his mind with the voice of his heart.
073.168 And he himself felt himself dying.
073.169 "Speak, doctor, I am listening," said Villefort; "knock, I am prepared for anything.
073.170 --Mrs. de Saint-Méran was quite old, no doubt, but she enjoyed excellent health."
073.171 Morrel breathed for the first time in ten minutes.
073.172 "Grief has killed her," said Villefort, "yes, grief, doctor! This habit of living for forty years near the marquis!
073.173 "It is not grief, my dear Villefort," said the doctor. Grief may kill, though cases are rare, but it does not kill in a day, but it does not kill in an hour, but it does not kill in ten minutes."
073.174 Villefort answered nothing; only he raised his head, which he had held down until then, and looked at the doctor with frightened eyes.
073.175 "You stayed there during the agony?" asked M. d'Avrigny.
073.176 --Surely, replied the king's prosecutor; you told me quietly not to go away.
073.177 --Did you notice the symptoms of the illness to which Mme de Saint-Méran succumbed?
073.178 --Certainly; Madame de Saint-Méran had three successive attacks within a few minutes of each other, and each time closer together and more serious. When you arrived, Mme. de Saint-Méran had already been panting for a few minutes; she then had an attack which I took for a simple attack of nerves; but I did not begin to be really frightened until I saw her rise on her bed, her limbs and neck tense. Then, by your face, I realized that the matter was more serious than I had thought. When the crisis was over, I looked for your eyes, but I did not find them. You held the pulse, you counted the beats, and the second crisis appeared, that you had not yet turned over to my side. This second crisis was more terrible than the first: the same nervous movements were repeated, and the mouth contracted and turned purple.
073.179 "In the third she expired.
073.180 "Already, since the end of the first one, I had recognized tetanus; you confirmed me in this opinion.
073.181 --Yes, in front of everyone, the doctor said; but now we are alone.
073.182 --What are you going to tell me, my God?
073.183 --That the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable matter are absolutely the same."
073.184 M. de Villefort rose to his feet; then, after an instant of immobility and silence, he fell back on his bench.
073.185 "Oh, my God, doctor," he said, "do you really think about what you are saying to me?
073.186 Morrel did not know whether he was dreaming or awake.
073.187 "Listen," said the doctor, "I know the importance of my statement and the character of the man to whom I am making it.
073.188 --Are you speaking to the magistrate or to the friend?" asked Villefort.
073.189 -- To the friend, to the friend alone at this moment; the relations between the symptoms of tetanus and the symptoms of poisoning by vegetable substances are so identical that if I had to sign what I am saying here, I declare that I would hesitate. Also, I repeat to you, it is not to the magistrate that I address myself, it is to the friend. Well, to the friend I say: During the three quarters of an hour that it lasted, I studied the agony, the convulsions, the death of Madame de Saint-Méran; well, in my conviction, not only did Madame de Saint-Méran die poisoned, but I would say, yes, I would say what poison killed her.
073.190 --Sir, sir!
073.191 - It's all there, you see: somnolence interrupted by nervous crises, overexcitement of the brain, torpor of the centers. Madame de Saint-Méran has succumbed to a violent dose of brucine or strychnine, which by chance, no doubt, perhaps by mistake, has been administered to her."
073.192 Villefort grasps the doctor's hand.
073.193 "Oh, it's impossible!" he said, "I'm dreaming, my God! It is frightful to hear such things from a man like you! In the name of Heaven, I beg you, dear doctor, tell me that you can be mistaken!
073.194 --Surely I can, but ....
073.195 --But...
073.196 --But I don't think so.
073.197 --Doctor, take pity on me; for the last few days so many unheard-of things have happened to me that I believe I could go mad.
073.198 --Has anyone else seen Madame de Saint-Méran?
073.199 --No one.
073.200 -Was any prescription sent to the pharmacist that was not submitted to me?
073.201 --None.
073.202 --Did Mrs. de Saint-Méran have any enemies?
073.203 --I don't know of any.
073.204 --Did anyone have an interest in her death?
073.205 --But no, my God! but no; my daughter is her only heir, Valentine alone.... Oh! if such a thought could come to me, I would stab myself to punish my heart for having been able to harbor such a thought for a single moment.
073.206 --Oh! cried M. d'Avrigny in his turn, dear friend, God forbid that I should accuse anyone; I am only speaking of an accident, you understand, of a mistake. But accident or error, the fact is there that speaks softly to my conscience, and that wants my conscience to speak loudly to you. Ask around.
073.207 --To whom? how? about what?
073.208 -- Let us see: did Barrois, the old servant, make a mistake and give Mme de Saint-Méran some potion prepared for her master?
073.209 --For my father?
073.210 --Yes.
073.211 --But how can a potion prepared for M. Noirtier poison Mme de Saint-Méran?
073.212 --Nothing could be simpler: you know that in certain illnesses poisons become a remedy; paralysis is one such illness. For about three months, after having used everything to restore movement and speech to Mr. Noirtier, I decided to try a last means; for three months, I say, I have been treating him with brucine; thus, in the last potion I ordered for him, six centigrams entered; six centigrams without action on the paralyzed organs of Mr. Noirtier, and to which, moreover, he has become accustomed by successive doses, six centigrams are enough to kill anyone other than him.
073.213 -My dear doctor, there is no communication between the apartment of M. Noirtier and that of Mme de Saint-Méran, and Barrois never entered my mother-in-law's house. Finally, I will tell you, doctor, although I know you to be the most skilful and above all the most conscientious man in the world, although in all circumstances your word is for me a torch which guides me as well as the light of the sun, well, doctor, well, I need, in spite of this conviction, to lean on this axiom, _errare humanum est_.
073.214 --Listen, Villefort," said the doctor, "is there a colleague of mine in whom you have as much confidence as in me?
073.215 --Why is that, you ask? What are you getting at?
073.216 --Call him, I'll tell him what I saw, what I noticed, we'll do the autopsy.
073.217 --And you will find traces of poison?
073.218 -- No, not poison, I didn't say that, but we will note the exasperation of the nervous system, we will recognize the patent, unquestionable asphyxia and we will say to you: Dear Villefort, if it is by negligence that the thing has happened, watch over your servants; if it is by hatred, watch over your enemies.
073.219 --Oh, my God! what are you proposing to me, d'Avrigny?" replied Villefort, dejected; "from the moment that there is someone other than yourself in the secret, an investigation will become necessary, and an investigation in my house, impossible! Yet," continued the King's Prosecutor, recovering himself and looking at the doctor with concern, "yet if you want it, if you absolutely demand it, I will do it. Indeed, perhaps I must follow up this matter; my character commands it. But, doctor, you can see that I am already saddened: to bring so much scandal into my house after so much pain! Oh, my wife and daughter will die; and I, doctor, you know that a man does not get to where I am, a man has not been a king's prosecutor for twenty-five years without having made many enemies; mine are many. This revealed affair will be for them a triumph which will make them tremble with joy, and I will cover myself with shame. Doctor, forgive me these worldly ideas. If you were a priest, I would not dare to say that to you; but you are a man, but you know the other men; doctor, doctor, you did not say anything to me, did you?
073.220 "My dear Monsieur de Villefort," replied the shaken doctor, "my first duty is humanity. I would have saved Mme de Saint-Méran if science had had the power to do so, but she is dead, I owe it to the living. Let us bury this terrible secret deep in our hearts. I will allow, if the eyes of some are opened on it, that one imputes to my ignorance the silence which I will have kept. However, sir, search still, search actively, because perhaps it will not stop there .... And when you have found the culprit, if you find him, I will tell you: You are a magistrate, do what you want!
073.221 --Oh! thank you, thank you, doctor!" said Villefort with inexpressible joy, "I have never had a better friend than you.
073.222 And as if he had feared that Doctor d'Avrigny would reconsider this concession, he got up and led the doctor to the side of the house.
073.223 They walked away.
073.224 Morrel, as if he needed to breathe, poked his head out of the copse, and the moonlight shone on a face so pale that it could have been mistaken for a ghost.
073.225 "God is protecting me in a manifest but terrible way," he said. But Valentine, Valentine! poor friend! will she withstand so much pain?"
073.226 As he said these words he looked alternately at the window with the red curtains and the three windows with the white curtains.
073.227 The light had almost completely disappeared from the window with the red curtains. No doubt Mme de Villefort had just turned off her lamp, and the night-light alone sent its reflection to the panes.
073.228 At the far end of the building, on the other hand, he saw one of the three windows with white curtains open. A candle on the mantelpiece threw out a few rays of its pale light, and a shadow came for a moment to lean against the balcony.
073.229 Morrel shivered; it seemed to him that he had heard a sob.
073.230 It was not surprising that this soul, ordinarily so brave and strong, now troubled and exalted by the two strongest of human passions, love and fear, had weakened to the point of superstitious hallucinations.
073.231 Although it was impossible, hidden as he was, for Valentine's eye to distinguish him, he believed he saw himself called by the shadow of the window; his troubled mind told him so, his ardent heart repeated it to him. This double error became an irresistible reality, and, by one of these incomprehensible impulses of youth, he leaped out of his hiding place, and in two strides, at the risk of being seen, at the risk of frightening Valentine, at the risk of giving the alarm by some involuntary cry escaped to the young girl, He crossed the flowerbed, which the moon made as wide and white as a lake, and, gaining the row of orange-tree boxes which stretched out in front of the house, he reached the steps of the porch, which he climbed quickly, and pushed open the door, which opened without resistance before him.
073.232 Valentine had not seen him; her eyes raised to heaven followed a silver cloud gliding over the azure, and whose form was that of a shadow ascending to heaven; her poetic and exalted spirit told her that it was the soul of her grandmother.
073.233 However, Morrel had crossed the antechamber and found the banister of the staircase; carpets spread over the steps muffled his steps; besides, Morrel had reached this point of exaltation that the presence of M. de Villefort himself would not have frightened him. If M. de Villefort had come in sight of him, his mind was made up: he would approach him and confess everything to him, begging him to excuse and approve this love which united him to his daughter, and his daughter to him; Morrel was mad.
073.234 Fortunately he saw no one.
073.235 It was then especially that this knowledge which he had taken by Valentine of the interior plan of the house was useful to him; he arrived without accident at the top of the staircase, and as, arrived there, he directed himself, a sob of which he recognized the expression indicated to him the way which he had to follow; he turned over; a door ajar let arrive at him the reflection of a light and the sound of the groaning voice. He pushed open the door and entered.
073.236 At the back of an alcove, under the white sheet that covered her head and outlined her shape, lay the dead woman, even more frightening to Morrel's eyes since the revelation of the secret which chance had made him the possessor.
073.237 Beside the bed, on her knees, with her head buried in the cushions of a large shepherdess, Valentine, shivering and lifted by sobs, stretched out her two clasped and stiffened hands above her head, which could not be seen.
073.238 She had left the open window, and prayed aloud with accents that would have touched the most insensitive heart, the word escaped from her lips, fast, incoherent, unintelligible, so much the pain tightened her throat of its burning embraces.
073.239 The moon, slipping through the opening of the shutters, made the light of the candle pale, and azure of its funeral tints this picture of desolation.
073.240 Morrel could not resist this spectacle; he was not of exemplary piety, he was not easy to impress, but Valentine suffering, crying, twisting his arms at the sight of him, it was more than he could bear in silence. He heaved a sigh, murmured a name, and the head drowned in tears and marbled on the velvet of the armchair, a head of Madeleine of Correggio, rose and remained turned towards him.
073.241 Valentine saw it and did not show astonishment. There are no more intermediate emotions in a heart swollen by a supreme despair.
073.242 Morrel held out his hand to his friend. Valentine, as an excuse for not having gone to find him, showed him the corpse lying under the funeral sheet and began to sob again.
073.243 Neither of them dared to speak in that room. Everyone hesitated to break the silence that Death seemed to command, standing in some corner with his finger on his lips.
073.244 Finally Valentine dared to speak first.
073.245 "Friend," she said, "how are you here? Alas! I would say to you: welcome, if it were not Death who had opened the door of this house to you.
073.246 --Valentine, said Morrel in a trembling voice and with clasped hands, I had been here since half-past eight; I did not see you coming, anxiety took hold of me, I jumped over the wall, I entered the garden; then voices which were talking about the fatal accident....
073.247 --What voices?" said Valentine.
073.248 Morrel shuddered, for the whole conversation of the doctor and M. de Villefort came back to his mind, and, through the sheet, he thought he saw those twisted arms, that stiffened neck, those purple lips.
073.249 "The voices of your servants," he said, "have taught me everything.
073.250 -But to come all the way here is to lose us, my friend," said Valentine, without fear or anger.
073.251 --Pardon me, replied Morrel in the same tone, I will withdraw.
073.252 --No, said Valentine, we would meet you, stay.
073.253 --But if we came?"
073.254 The girl shook her head.
073.255 "No one will come," she said, "rest assured, here is our safeguard."
073.256 And she pointed to the shape of the corpse molded by the sheet.
073.257 "But what has happened to M. d'Épinay? Tell me, I beg you," continued Morrel.
073.258 --Mr. Franz arrived to sign the contract just as my good grandmother was breathing her last.
073.259 --Alas!" said Morrel with a feeling of selfish joy, for he thought within himself that this death would delay Valentine's marriage indefinitely.
073.260 --But what redoubles my pain, continued the young girl, as if this feeling should have received its punishment at once, is that this poor grandmother, in dying, ordered that the marriage be completed as soon as possible; she too, my God! in believing herself to be protecting me, she too was acting against me.
073.261 --Listen!" said Morrel.
073.262 The two young men remained silent.
073.263 The door was heard to open, and footsteps made the corridor floor and the steps of the stairs creak.
073.264 "It's my father coming out of his study," said Valentine.
073.265 --And driving the doctor away, added Morrel.
073.266 --How do you know it's the doctor?" asked Valentine in astonishment.
073.267 --I presume so," said Morrel.
073.268 Valentine looked at the young man.
073.269 However, the door to the street was heard to close. M. de Villefort went to turn the key to the garden door and then went up the stairs.
073.270 When he reached the anteroom, he stopped for a moment, as if hesitating whether to enter his own house or Mme de Saint-Méran's room. Morrel threw himself behind a door. Valentine did not make a movement; it was as if a supreme pain placed her above ordinary fears.
073.271 M. de Villefort returned home.
073.272 "Now," said Valentine, "you can no longer go out either by the garden gate or by the street gate."
073.273 Morrel looked at the girl in astonishment.
073.274 "Now," she said, "there is only one permitted and safe way out, and that is through my grandfather's apartment."
073.275 She stood up.
073.276 "Come," she said.
073.277 --Where?" asked Maximilian.
073.278 --My grandfather's house.
073.279 --Moi, at M. Noirtier's?
073.280 --Yes.
073.281 --Are you thinking about it, Valentine?
073.282 -- I have been thinking about it, and for a long time. I have only this friend left in the world, and we both need him.... Come.
073.283 --Prenez garde, Valentine, said Morrel, hesitating to do what the young girl ordered him to do; take care, the blindfold has fallen from my eyes: in coming here, I have accomplished an act of madness. Are you quite sane yourself, dear friend?
073.284 --Yes, said Valentine, and I have no scruples in the world, except to leave alone the remains of my poor grandmother, whom I have taken upon myself to guard.
073.285 --Valentine, said Morrel, death is sacred by itself.
073.286 --Yes, replied the girl; besides, it will be short, come on."
073.287 Valentine crossed the corridor and descended a small staircase that led to Noirtier's house. Morrel followed her on tiptoe. When they reached the landing of the apartment, they found the old servant.
073.288 "Barrois," said Valentine, "close the door and let no one in."
073.289 She went in first.
073.290 Noirtier, still in his armchair, attentive to the slightest noise, instructed by his old servant of all that was going on, fixed eager glances on the entrance to the room; he saw Valentine, and his eye shone.
073.291 There was something grave and solemn in the girl's walk and attitude that struck the old man. Also, from being bright, his eye became questioning.
073.292 "Dear father," she said in a brief voice, "listen to me carefully: you know that good mother Saint-Méran died an hour ago, and that now, except for you, I have no one left in the world who loves me?"
073.293 An expression of infinite tenderness passed into the old man's eyes.
073.294 "So it is to you alone, is it not, that I must confide my sorrows or my hopes?"
073.295 The paralytic nodded.
073.296 Valentine took Maximilian by the hand.
073.297 "Then," she said to him, "take a good look at him."
073.298 The old man fixed his scrutinizing and slightly astonished eye on Morrel.
073.299 "This is M. Maximilien Morrel," she said, "the son of that merchant man from Marseilles of whom you have doubtless heard?
073.300 --Yes," said the old man.
073.301 --That is an irreproachable name, which Maximilien is making glorious, for, at thirty years of age, he is a captain of spahis, officer of the Legion of Honor."
073.302 The old man nodded that he remembered.
073.303 "Well, good papa," said Valentine, putting herself on both knees before the old man and pointing to Maximilian with one hand, "I love him and will be only to him! If I am forced to marry another, I will let myself die or kill myself."
073.304 The eyes of the paralytic expressed a whole world of tumultuous thoughts.
073.305 "You love Mr. Maximilien Morrel, don't you, good papa?" asked the girl.
073.306 --Yes," said the old man motionless.
073.307 --And can you protect us, who are also your children, against my father's will?"
073.308 Noirtier fixed his intelligent gaze on Morrel, as if to say to him:
073.309 "It is according to."
073.310 Maximilien understood.
073.311 "Mademoiselle," he said, "you have a sacred duty to perform in your grandmother's room; will you allow me to have the honor of talking with M. Noirtier for a moment?
073.312 --Yes, yes, that's right," said the old man's eye.
073.313 Then he looked at Valentine with concern.
073.314 "How will he understand you, you mean, good father?
073.315 --Yes.
073.316 --Oh, be quiet; we have talked about you so often, he knows well how I talk to you."
073.317 Then, turning to Maximilian with a lovely smile, though that smile was veiled by a deep sadness:
073.318 "He knows everything I know," she said.
073.319 Valentine got up, took a seat for Morrel, advised Barrois not to let anyone in; and after kissing her grandfather tenderly and saying a sad farewell to Morrel, she left. Then Morrel, to prove to Noirtier that he had Valentine's confidence and knew all their secrets, took the dictionary, the quill, and the paper, and placed them on a table where there was a lamp.
073.320 "But first," said Morrel, "allow me, sir, to tell you who I am, how I love Miss Valentine, and what my designs are towards her.
073.321 --I am listening," said Noirtier.
073.322 It was quite an imposing spectacle that this old man, useless as a burden in appearance, had become the only protector, the only support, the only judge of two young, beautiful, strong lovers entering into life.
073.323 His figure, imbued with a remarkable nobility and austerity, imposed on Morrel, who began his story with trembling.
073.324 He then told how he had known, how he had loved Valentine, and how Valentine, in his isolation and unhappiness, had accepted the offer of his devotion. He told her what his birth, his position, his fortune were; and more than once, when he questioned the gaze of the paralytic, that gaze answered him:
073.325 "That's fine, go on.
073.326 --Now, said Morrel when he had finished this first part of his narrative, now that I have told you, sir, my love and my hopes, shall I tell you our plans?
073.327 --Yes, said the old man.
073.328 --Well, that is what we had resolved."
073.329 And then he told Noirtier everything: how a cabriolet was waiting in the enclosure, how he intended to kidnap Valentine, take her to his sister's house, marry her, and in respectful expectation hope for M. de Villefort's pardon.
073.330 "No," said Noirtier.
073.331 --No?" said Morrel, "that is not the way to do it?
073.332 --No.
073.333 --So this project does not have your assent?
073.334 --No.
073.335 --Well, there is another way," said Morrel.
073.336 The old man's questioning look asked:
073.337 "Which one?"
073.338 "I will go," continued Maximilien, "I will go and find M. Franz d'Épinay, I am glad to be able to tell you this in the absence of Mlle. de Villefort, and I will conduct myself with him in such a way as to force him to be a gallant man.
073.339 Noirtier's gaze continued to interrogate.
073.340 "What I will do?
073.341 --Yes.
073.342 --Here it is. I will go to him, as I told you, I will tell him of the ties which unite me to Miss Valentine; if he is a delicate man, he will prove his delicacy by renouncing of his own accord the hand of his fiancée, and my friendship and devotion are from this hour acquired for him until death; If he refuses, either because interest drives him, or because ridiculous pride makes him persist, after having proved to him that he would constrain my wife, that Valentine loves me and cannot love any other than me, I will fight with him, giving him every advantage, and I will kill him or he will kill me; if I kill him, he will not marry Valentine; if he kills me, I will be quite sure that Valentine will not marry him. "
073.343 Noirtier regarded with unspeakable pleasure this noble and sincere physiognomy on which were painted all the sentiments that his tongue expressed, adding to it by the expression of a beautiful face all that color adds to a solid and true drawing.
073.344 However, when Morrel had finished speaking, Noirtier closed his eyes several times, which was, as we know, his way of saying no.
073.345 "No?" said Morrel. So you disapprove of this second project, as you have already disapproved of the first?
073.346 --Yes, I disapprove," said the old man.
073.347 --But what to do then, sir? The last words of Madame de Saint-Méran were that the marriage of her granddaughter should not be delayed: shall I let things be accomplished?"
073.348 Noirtier remained motionless.
073.349 "Yes, I understand," said Morrel, "I must wait.
073.350 --Yes.
073.351 --But any delay will lose us, sir," continued the young man. Alone, Valentine is without strength, and one will constrain her like a child. I have entered here miraculously to know what is going on, admitted miraculously before you, I cannot reasonably hope that these good chances will be renewed. Believe me, there is only one or the other of the two parties which I propose to you, forgive this vanity of my youth, which is the right one; tell me which of the two you prefer: do you authorize Miss Valentine to confide in my honor?
073.352 --No.
073.353 --Do you prefer that I go to M. d'Épinay?
073.354 --No.
073.355 --But, my God! from whom will come the help we expect from Heaven?"
073.356 The old man smiled with his eyes as he used to smile when one spoke to him of Heaven. There had always remained a little atheism in the old Jacobin's ideas.
073.357 "Of chance?" said Morrel.
073.358 --No.
073.359 --From you?
073.360 --Yes.
073.361 --From you?
073.362 --Yes, repeated the old man.
073.363 --Do you understand what I am asking you, sir? Excuse my insistence, for my life depends on your answer: our salvation will come from you?
073.364 --Yes.
073.365 --Are you sure?
073.366 --Yes.
073.367 --You answer to that?
073.368 --Yes."
073.369 And there was in the look that gave this statement such firmness, that there was no way to doubt the will, if not the power.
073.370 "Oh, thank you, sir, thank you a hundred times! But how, unless a miracle from the Lord restores to you speech, gesture, movement, how will you, you, chained in this chair, you, mute and immobile, be able to oppose this marriage?"
073.371 A smile lit up the old man's face, a strange smile that of eyes on a motionless face.
073.372 "So I must wait?" asked the young man.
073.373 --Yes. But the contract?"
073.374 The same smile appeared again.
073.375 "Do you mean to tell me that it will not be signed?
073.376 --Yes," said Noirtier.
073.377 --And so the contract will not even be signed! Oh, forgive me, sir! at the announcement of a great happiness, it is quite permissible to doubt; the contract will not be signed?
073.378 -- No," said the paralytic.
073.379 In spite of this assurance, Morrel hesitated to believe. This promise of an impotent old man was so strange, that instead of coming from a force of will, it could emanate from a weakening of the organs; is it not natural that the fool who is unaware of his folly should pretend to achieve things above his power? The weak man speaks of the burdens he lifts, the timid man of the giants he faces, the poor man of the treasures he handles, the humblest peasant, on account of his pride, is called Jupiter.
073.380 Either Noirtier had understood the young man's indecision, or he did not fully believe the docility he had shown, and he stared at him.
073.381 "What do you want, sir?" asked Morrel, "that I should renew my promise to you to do nothing?"
073.382 Noirtier's gaze remained fixed and firm, as if to say that a promise was not enough for him; then it passed from his face to his hand.
073.383 "Do you want me to swear, sir?" asked Maximilien.
073.384 --Yes," said the paralytic with equal solemnity, "I do."
073.385 Morrel understood that the old man attached great importance to this oath.
073.386 He extended his hand.
073.387 "On my honor," he said, "I swear to you that I will wait for what you decide before acting against M. d'Épinay.
073.388 --Good," the old man made eye contact.
073.389 -- "Now, sir," asked Morrel, "do you order me to withdraw?
073.390 --Yes.
073.391 --Without seeing Miss Valentine again?
073.392 --Yes."
073.393 Morrel signaled that he was ready to obey.
073.394 "Now," Morrel continued, "will you allow, sir, your son to kiss you as your daughter did just now!"
073.395 There was no mistaking the expression in Noirtier's eyes.
073.396 The young man placed his lips on the old man's forehead in the same place where the girl had placed hers.
073.397 Then he greeted the old man a second time and left.
073.398 On the square he found the old servant, warned by Valentine; this one waited for Morrel, and guided him through the detours of a dark corridor which led to a small door giving on the garden.
073.399 Arrived there, Morrel gained the gate, by the bower, he was in an instant at the top of the wall, and by his ladder in a second, he was in the enclosure with the alfalfa, where his cabriolet always awaited him.
073.400 He went up there, and broken by so many emotions, but with a freer heart, he returned towards midnight to rue Meslay, threw himself on his bed and slept as if he had been plunged into a deep intoxication.
074.000 The vault of the Villefort family.
074.001 Two days later, at about ten o'clock in the morning, a large crowd had gathered at M. de Villefort's door, and a long line of mourning cars and private carriages had been seen advancing all along the Faubourg Saint-Honoré and the Rue de la Pépinière.
074.002 Among these cars, there was one of a singular form, and which seemed to have made a long voyage. It was a kind of van painted in black, and which one of the first had been at the funeral appointment.
074.003 Then one had inquired, and one had learned that, by a strange coincidence, this car contained the body of M. de Saint-Méran, and that those who had come for a single convoy would follow two corpses.
074.004 The number of these was great; the Marquis de Saint-Méran, one of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of King Louis XVIII and King Charles X, had kept a large number of friends who, joined to the people whom social convenience put in relation with Villefort, formed a considerable troop.
074.005 The authorities were immediately notified, and it was agreed that the two convoys would be made at the same time. A second carriage, decked out with the same mortuary pomp, was brought to Mr. de Villefort's door, and the coffin was transported from the post van to the funeral carriage.
074.006 The two bodies were to be buried in the Père-Lachaise cemetery, where M. de Villefort had long since had a vault built for the burial of his entire family.
074.007 In this vault had already been placed the body of poor Renée, whom her father and mother had come to join after ten years of separation.
074.008 Paris, always curious, always moved by the funeral procession, saw with religious silence the splendid procession that accompanied to their last resting place two of the names of this old aristocracy, the most famous for the traditional spirit, for the safety of the business and the obstinate devotion to the principles.
074.009 In the same mourning car, Beauchamp, Albert and Château-Renaud were talking about this almost sudden death.
074.010 "I saw Mme de Saint-Méran only last year in Marseilles," said Château-Renaud, "I had just returned from Algeria; she was a woman destined to live a hundred years, thanks to her perfect health, her ever-present spirit, and her always prodigious activity. How old was she?
074.011 --Sixty-six, answered Albert, at least as far as Franz assured me. But it was not age that killed her, it was the grief she felt at the death of the Marquis; it seems that since this death, which had shaken her violently, she has not completely regained her reason.
074.012 -But what did she die of?" asked Beauchamp.
074.013 --A cerebral congestion, it seems, or a lightning apoplexy. Isn't that the same thing?
074.014 --But just about.
074.015 --Apoplexy?" said Beauchamp, "that is hard to believe. Mme. de Saint-Méran, whom I also saw once or twice in my life, was small, slender of form and of a constitution much more nervous than sanguine; they are rare apoplexies produced by grief on a body of a constitution like that of Mme. de Saint-Méran.
074.016 -- In any case, said Albert, whatever the illness or the doctor who killed her, here is M. de Villefort, or rather Miss Valentine, or rather our friend Franz in possession of a magnificent inheritance: eighty thousand pounds of income, I believe.
074.017 --Inheritance which will be almost doubled on the death of that old Jacobin Noirtier.
074.018 --Here is a tenacious grandfather, says Beauchamp. He bet against death, I believe, that he would bury all his heirs. He will succeed, my faith. It is indeed the old conventionalist of 93, who said to Napoleon in 1814:
074.019 "--You go down, because your empire is a young stem tired by its growth; take the Republic for tutor, let us return with a good constitution on the battlefields and I promise you five hundred thousand soldiers, another Marengo and a second Austerlitz. Ideas do not die, Sire, they sometimes slumber, but they wake up stronger than before they fell asleep.
074.020 --It seems, said Albert, that for him men are like ideas; only one thing worries me, it is to know how Franz d'Épinay will deal with a grandfather-in-law who cannot do without his wife; but where is he, Franz?
074.021 -But he is in the first carriage with M. de Villefort, who already considers him to be family."
074.022 In each of the carriages that followed the mourners, the conversation was much the same; they were surprised at these two deaths so close together and so quickly, but in none of them was there any suspicion of the terrible secret that M. d'Avrigny had, in his nightly walk, revealed to M. de Villefort.
074.023 After about an hour's walk, they arrived at the gate of the cemetery: the weather was calm, but gloomy, and therefore quite in harmony with the funeral ceremony that was to be performed there. Among the groups which went towards the family vault, Château-Renaud recognized Morrel, who had come alone and in a cabriolet; he walked alone, very pale and silent, on the small path bordered with yews.
074.024 "You here!" said Château-Renaud, passing his arm under that of the young captain; "you know M. de Villefort then? How is it, then, that I have never seen you at his house?
074.025 - "It is not M. de Villefort that I know," replied Morrel, "it is Mme. de Saint-Méran that I knew.
074.026 At this moment Albert joined them with Franz.
074.027 "The place is ill-chosen for a presentation," said Albert; "but never mind, we are not superstitious. Mr. Morrel, allow me to introduce you to Mr. Franz d'Épinay, an excellent fellow traveler with whom I have made the tour of Italy. My dear Franz, M. Maximilien Morrel, an excellent friend whom I have acquired in your absence, and whose name you will hear recurring in my conversation whenever I have to speak of heart, mind, and amiability."
074.028 Morrel had a moment of indecision. He wondered if it was not a condemnable hypocrisy that this almost friendly greeting addressed to the man he was deafly fighting; but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances came back to his mind: he endeavored not to let anything show on his face, and greeted Franz by containing himself.
074.029 "Miss de Villefort is very sad, isn't she?" said Debray, to Franz.
074.030 --Oh, sir," replied Franz, with inexplicable sadness; "this morning she was so defeated that I hardly recognized her."
074.031 These words, so simple in appearance, broke Morrel's heart. This man had thus seen Valentine, he had thus spoken to her?
074.032 It was then that the young and ebullient officer needed all his strength to resist the desire to violate his oath.
074.033 He took Château-Renaud's arm and led him quickly to the vault, in front of which the funeral directors had just placed the two coffins.
074.034 "Magnificent dwelling," said Beauchamp, casting his eyes on the mausoleum; summer palace, winter palace. You will stay there in your turn, my dear d'Épinay, for you will soon be a member of the family. As for me, as a philosopher, I want a little house in the country, a cottage there under the trees, and not so many stones on my poor body. When I die, I will say to those around me what Voltaire wrote to Piron: _Eo rus_, and all will be finished.... Come on, damn it! Franz, courage, your wife inherits.
074.035 --In truth, Beauchamp, says Franz, you are unbearable. Political affairs have given you the habit of laughing at everything, and men who conduct business are used to believing in nothing. But finally, Beauchamp, when you have the honor of finding yourself with ordinary men, and the happiness of leaving politics for a moment, try to take back your heart that you leave at the office of the canes of the Chamber of Deputies or the Chamber of Peers.
074.036 --Eh, my God!" said Beauchamp, "what is life? a pause in the anteroom of death.
074.037 --I take Beauchamp to task," said Albert. And he withdrew four steps back with Franz, leaving Beauchamp to continue his philosophical dissertations with Debray.
074.038 The vault of the Villefort family formed a square of white stone about twenty feet high, an interior partition divided the Saint-Méran family and the Villefort family into two compartments, and each compartment had its own entrance door.
074.039 One did not see, as in the other tombs, those ignoble superimposed drawers in which a thrifty distribution locks up the dead with an inscription that resembles a label; all one saw at first through the bronze door was a severe and dark antechamber, separated by a wall from the real tomb.
074.040 It was in the middle of this wall that the two doors we mentioned earlier opened, and which communicated with the Villefort and Saint-Méran tombs.
074.041 There, sorrows could be exhaled in freedom without the foolish walkers, who make a visit to Père-Lachaise a part of the countryside or a rendezvous of love, coming to disturb by their songs, by their cries or by their running the silent contemplation or the prayer bathed in tears of the inhabitant of the vault.
074.042 The two coffins entered the right-hand vault, that of the Saint-Méran family; they were placed on the prepared trestles, which awaited their mortuary deposit in advance; Villefort, Franz and some close relatives entered the sanctuary alone.
074.043 As the religious ceremonies had been performed at the door, and there were no speeches to be made, the attendants separated at once; Château-Renaud, Albert and Morrel withdrew to their side and Debray and Beauchamp to theirs.
074.044 Franz remained, with M. de Villefort, at the door of the cemetery; Morrel stopped at the first opportunity; he saw Franz and M. de Villefort leave in a mourning car, and he concluded that this tête-à-tête was a bad omen. He therefore returned to Paris, and, although he himself was in the same carriage as Château-Renaud and Albert, he did not hear a word the two young men said.
074.045 Indeed, just as Franz was about to leave M. de Villefort
074.046 "Monsieur le baron," said the latter, "when shall I see you again?
074.047 -- Whenever you like, sir," Franz replied.
074.048 --As soon as possible.
074.049 --I am at your command, sir; would you like us to come back together?
074.050 --If it does not cause you any inconvenience.
074.051 --None."
074.052 It was thus that the future father-in-law and the future son-in-law got into the same car, and that Morrel, seeing them pass, conceived with reason serious worries.
074.053 Villefort and Franz returned to the Faubourg Saint-Honoré.
074.054 The king's prosecutor, without entering anyone's house, without speaking to either his wife or his daughter, showed the young man into his study and showed him a chair:
074.055 "Monsieur d'Épinay," he said to him, "I think I remember you, and perhaps the moment is not so badly chosen as one might think at first sight, for obedience to the dead is the first offering that must be laid on the coffin; I must therefore remind you of the vow which Mme. de Saint-Méran expressed the day before yesterday on her bed of agony, that Valentine's marriage should not suffer any delay. You know that the affairs of the deceased are perfectly in order; that her will assures Valentine all the fortune of the Saint-Mérans; the notary showed me yesterday the acts which allow to draw up in a definitive way the marriage contract. You can see the notary and have me communicate these acts to you. The notary is Mr. Deschamps, place Beauveau, faubourg Saint-Honoré.
074.056 --Monsieur, answered d'Épinay, it is not perhaps the moment for Miss Valentine, plunged as she is in grief, to think of a husband; in truth, I would fear....
074.057 --Valentine," interrupted M. de Villefort, "will have no greater desire than that of fulfilling her grandmother's last intentions; so the obstacles will not come from this side, I can assure you.
074.058 --In this case, sir," replied Franz, "as they will not come from mine either, you can do as you please; my word is binding, and I will fulfill it, not only with pleasure, but with happiness.
074.059 - "Then," said Villefort, "there is nothing to stop you any longer; the contract was to be signed three days ago, we will find it all prepared: it can be signed today.
074.060 --But the mourning? said Franz hesitatingly.
074.061 - "Don't worry, sir," continued Villefort; "it is not in my house that propriety is neglected. I am not going to be able to say that I am going to have a good time, but I am going to have to say that I am not going to have a good time. There, in eight days, if you wish, without noise, without pomp, the civil marriage will be concluded. It was Mme de Saint-Méran's wish that her granddaughter should marry on this land. The marriage concluded, sir, you will be able to return to Paris, while your wife will spend the time of her mourning with her mother-in-law.
074.062 --As you wish, sir, said Franz.
074.063 - "Then," said M. de Villefort, "take the trouble to wait half an hour; Valentine will come down to the salon. I will send for M. Deschamps, we will read and sign the contract now, and, this evening, Mme de Villefort will take Valentine to her land, where in eight days we will go to join them.
074.064 --Monsieur, said Franz, I have only one request to make of you.
074.065 --What is it?
074.066 -- I wish that Albert de Morcerf and Raoul de Château-Renaud be present at this signing; you know that they are my witnesses.
074.067 -- Half an hour is enough to warn them; do you want to go and get them yourself? do you want to send for them?
074.068 -- I prefer to go, sir.
074.069 --I will wait for you in half an hour, Baron, and in half an hour Valentine will be ready."
074.070 Franz saluted M. de Villefort and went out.
074.071 No sooner had the door to the street closed behind the young man, than Villefort sent to warn Valentine that she had to come down to the salon in half an hour, because the notary and M. d'Épinay's witnesses were expected.
074.072 This unexpected news caused a great sensation in the house. Mme de Villefort did not want to believe it, and Valentine was crushed by it as by a thunderbolt.
074.073 She looked around as if to find out whom she could ask for help.
074.074 She wanted to go down to her grandfather's house, but she met M. de Villefort on the stairs, who took her by the arm and led her into the living room.
074.075 In the anteroom Valentine met Barrois, and gave the old servant a desperate look.
074.076 A moment after Valentine, Mme de Villefort entered the salon with little Edouard. It was obvious that the young woman had had her share of family sorrows; she was pale and looked horribly tired.
074.077 She sat down, took Edward on her lap, and from time to time pressed, with almost convulsive movements, on her breast this child on whom her whole life seemed to be concentrated.
074.078 Soon the sound of two cars entering the courtyard was heard.
074.079 One was the notary's, the other Franz's and his friends'.
074.080 In an instant, everyone was gathered in the living room.
074.081 Valentine was so pale, that one saw the blue veins of her temples draw around her eyes and run along her cheeks.
074.082 Franz could not defend himself from a rather sharp emotion.
074.083 Château-Renaud and Albert looked at each other with astonishment: the ceremony that had just ended did not seem to them sadder than the one that was about to begin.
074.084 Mme de Villefort had placed herself in the shadows, behind a velvet curtain, and, as she was constantly bending over her son, it was difficult to read on her face what was going on in her heart.
074.085 M. de Villefort was, as always, impassive. The notary, after having, with the ordinary method of people of law, arranged the papers on the table, having taken place in his armchair and having raised his glasses, turned towards Franz:
074.086 "Are you Monsieur Franz de Quesnel, Baron d'Épinay?" he asked, although he knew it perfectly well.
074.087 --Yes, sir," answered Franz.
074.088 The notary bowed.
074.089 "I must therefore warn you, sir," he said, "and this on behalf of M. de Villefort, that your planned marriage to Mlle. de Villefort has changed M. Noirtier's dispositions towards his granddaughter, and that he is entirely alienating the fortune he was to have transmitted to her. Let us hasten to add," continued the notary, "that the testator having the right to alienate only a part of his fortune, and having alienated the whole, the will will not withstand the attack but will be declared null and void.
074.090 -- Yes, said Villefort; only I warn M. d'Épinay in advance that, during my lifetime, my father's will will never be attacked, my position defending me from even the shadow of a scandal.
074.091 --Sir, says Franz, I am annoyed that one raised such a question in front of Miss Valentine. I never inquired about the figure of her fortune, which, however small it may be, will be even more considerable than mine. What my family sought in the alliance of M. de Villefort was consideration; what I seek is happiness."
074.092 Valentine made an imperceptible sign of thanks, while two silent tears rolled down her cheeks.
074.093 "Besides, sir," said Villefort, addressing his future son-in-law, "apart from this loss of a portion of your hopes, there is nothing in this unexpected will that should personally hurt you; it is explained by the weakness of mind of M. Noirtier. What displeases my father is not that Mlle de Villefort should marry you, but that Valentine should marry: a union with any other man would have caused him the same grief. Old age is selfish, sir, and Mlle. de Villefort was a faithful companion to M. Noirtier that Mme. The unhappy state in which my father finds himself causes him to be seldom spoken to about serious affairs, which the weakness of his mind would not permit him to follow, and I am perfectly convinced that at this hour, while retaining the memory that his granddaughter is marrying, M. Noirtier has forgotten even the name of the one who is to become his grandson."
074.094 No sooner had M. de Villefort finished these words, to which Franz replied with a salute, than the door of the salon opened and Barrois appeared.
074.095 "Gentlemen," he said in a voice strangely firm for a servant speaking to his masters on such a solemn occasion, "gentlemen, M. Noirtier de Villefort wishes to speak at once to M. Franz de Quesnel, Baron d'Épinay."
074.096 He too, like the notary, and so that there could be no mistake, gave all his titles to the groom.
074.097 Villefort shuddered, Mme de Villefort let her son slip from her lap, Valentine stood up pale and mute as a statue.
074.098 Albert and Château-Renaud exchanged a second glance, even more astonished than the first.
074.099 The notary looked at Villefort.
074.100 --That is impossible, said the king's prosecutor; besides, M. d'Épinay cannot leave the salon at this moment.
074.101 -It is precisely at this moment, Barrois continued with the same firmness, that M. Noirtier, my master, wishes to speak to M. Franz d'Épinay about important matters.
074.102 --So now he is talking, good Papa Noirtier?" asked Edouard with his usual impertinence.
074.103 But this remark did not even make Mme de Villefort smile, so preoccupied were the spirits, so solemn did the situation seem.
074.104 "Tell M. Noirtier," resumed Villefort, "that what he asks cannot be done.
074.105 --Then M. Noirtier warns these gentlemen," resumed Barrois, "that he is going to have himself brought to the salon."
074.106 The astonishment was at its height.
074.107 A sort of smile appeared on Mme de Villefort's face. Valentine, as if in spite of herself, raised her eyes to the ceiling to thank Heaven.
074.108 "Valentine," said M. de Villefort, "go and find out a little, I pray you, what this new fancy of your grandfather's is."
074.109 Valentine took a few quick steps to leave, but M. de Villefort changed his mind.
074.110 "Wait," he said, "I'll accompany you.
074.111 --Pardon, sir," said Franz in his turn; "it seems to me that, since it is I whom M. Noirtier has asked to see you, it is especially up to me to comply with his wishes; besides, I shall be happy to pay my respects to him, as I have not yet had occasion to ask for this honor.
074.112 --Oh, my God!" said Villefort with visible anxiety, "don't bother.
074.113 --Excuse me, sir," said Franz in the tone of a man who has made up his mind. I do not wish to miss this opportunity of proving to M. Noirtier how wrong he would be to conceive against me repugnancies which I am determined to overcome, whatever they may be, by my profound devotion."
074.114 And, without allowing himself to be detained any longer by Villefort, Franz rose in his turn and followed Valentine, who was already descending the staircase with the joy of a shipwrecked man who puts his hand on a rock.
074.115 M. de Villefort followed them both.
074.116 Château-Renaud and Morcerf exchanged a third glance, even more astonished than the first two.
075.000 The minutes.
075.001 Noirtier was waiting, dressed in black and seated in his armchair.
075.002 When the three people he expected to see came in, he looked at the door, which his valet closed at once.
075.003 "Be careful," said Villefort low to Valentine, who could not conceal his joy, "that if M. Noirtier wants to communicate to you things that prevent your marriage, I forbid you to understand him."
075.004 Valentine blushed, but did not answer.
075.005 Villefort approached Noirtier:
075.006 "Here is M. Franz d'Épinay," he said to him, "you have mandated him, sir, and he is surrendering to your wishes. No doubt we have long wished for this interview, and I shall be charmed if it proves to you how little your opposition to Valentine's marriage was founded."
075.007 Noirtier replied only with a look that sent a shiver through Villefort's veins.
075.008 He made a sign with his eye to Valentine to approach.
075.009 In a moment, thanks to the means she was accustomed to use in conversations with her grandfather, she had found the word "key.
075.010 Then she consulted the paralytic's gaze, which was fixed on the drawer of a small cabinet between the two windows.
075.011 She opened the drawer and found a key. When she had the key and the old man had signaled that it was the one he was asking for, the paralytic's eyes went to an old secretary that had been forgotten for many years, and which, it was believed, contained nothing but useless papers.
075.012 "Shall I open the desk?" asked Valentine.
075.013 --Yes, said the old man.
075.014 --Should I open the drawers?
075.015 --Yes.
075.016 --Those on the sides?
075.017 --No.
075.018 --Middle one?
075.019 --Yes."
075.020 Valentine opened it and pulled out a bundle.
075.021 "Is this what you want, good father?" she said.
075.022 --No."
075.023 She pulled out all the other papers in succession, until there was absolutely nothing left in the drawer.
075.024 "But the drawer is empty now," she said.
075.025 Noirtier's eyes were fixed on the dictionary.
075.026 "Yes, good father, I understand you," said the girl.
075.027 And she repeated, one after the other, each letter of the alphabet; at the S Noirtier stopped her.
075.028 She opened the dictionary, and looked up the word _secret_.
075.029 "Ah! there is a secret?" said Valentine.
075.030 --Yes," said Noirtier.
075.031 --And who knows this secret?"
075.032 Noirtier looked at the door through which the servant had gone out.
075.033 "Barrois?" she said.
075.034 --Yes," said Noirtier.
075.035 --Shall I call him?
075.036 --Yes."
075.037 Valentine went to the door and called Barrois.
075.038 Meanwhile, the sweat of impatience trickled down Villefort's forehead, and Franz remained stunned with astonishment.
075.039 The old servant appeared.
075.040 "Barrois," said Valentine, "my grandfather commanded me to take the key from this console, to open this secretary and to pull out this drawer; now there is a secret in this drawer, it seems you know it, open it."
075.041 Barrois looked at the old man.
075.042 "Obey," said the intelligent eye of Noirtier.
075.043 Barrois obeyed; a double bottom opened and presented a bundle of papers tied with a black ribbon.
075.044 "Is this what you want, sir?" asked Barrois.
075.045 --Yes," said Noirtier.
075.046 --To whom should these papers be given? To M. de Villefort?
075.047 --No.
075.048 --To Miss Valentine?
075.049 --No.
075.050 --To Monsieur Franz d'Épinay?
075.051 --Yes."
075.052 Franz, astonished, took a step forward.
075.053 "To me, sir?" he said.
075.054 --Yes."
075.055 Franz received the papers from Barrois' hands, and casting his eyes on the cover, he read:
075.056 "To be deposited, after my death, with my friend General Durand, who himself on dying will bequeath this packet to his son, with an injunction to preserve it as containing a paper of the greatest importance."
075.057 "Well, sir," asked Franz, "what do you want me to do with this paper?
075.058 --To keep it sealed as it is, no doubt," said the king's attorney.
075.059 -- "No, no," replied Noirtier briskly.
075.060 --Do you perhaps want monsieur to read it? asked Valentine.
075.061 --Yes, replied the old man.
075.062 --You hear, Monsieur le Baron, my grandfather asks you to read this paper, said Valentine.
075.063 --Then let us sit down, Villefort said impatiently, for it will take some time.
075.064 --Sit down," said the old man's eye.
075.065 Villefort sat down, but Valentine remained standing next to his father, leaning against his chair, and Franz stood before him. He held the mysterious paper in his hand.
075.066 "Read," said the old man's eyes.
075.067 Franz untied the envelope, and a great silence fell in the room. In the midst of this silence he read:
075.068 "_Extract from the minutes of a session of the Bonapartist club of the Rue Saint-Jacques, held on February 5, 1815_."
075.069 Franz paused.
075.070 "February 5, 1815! That's the day my father was murdered!"
075.071 Valentine and Villefort remained mute; the old man's eye alone said clearly, "Continue."
075.072 "But it was on the way out of this club," continued Franz, "that my father disappeared!"
075.073 Noirtier's gaze continued to say, "Read."
075.074 He continued:
075.075 "The undersigned Louis-Jacques Beaurepaire, lieutenant-colonel of artillery, Etienne Duchampy, brigadier general, and Claude Lecharpal, director of waters and forests,
075.076 "Declare that, on February 4, 1815, a letter arrived from the island of Elba, which recommended to the benevolence and confidence of the members of the Bonapartist club the general Flavien de Quesnel, who, having served the Emperor from 1804 until 1815, was to be completely devoted to the Napoleonic dynasty, in spite of the title of baron that Louis XVIII had just attached to his land of Épinay.
075.077 "Consequently, a bill was addressed to General de Quesnel, asking him to attend the next day's session. The bill did not indicate the street or the number of the house where the meeting was to be held; it bore no signature, but it announced to the general that, if he wanted to be ready, he would be picked up at nine o'clock in the evening.
075.078 "The meetings were held from nine o'clock in the evening until midnight.
075.079 "At nine o'clock the president of the club came to the general's house, the general was ready; the president told him that one of the conditions of his introduction was that he would be eternally unaware of the place of the meeting, and that he would allow himself to be blindfolded, swearing not to try to lift the blindfold.
075.080 "General de Quesnel accepted the condition, and promised on his honor not to try to see where he would be led.
075.081 "The general had his carriage prepared; but the president told him that it was impossible to use it, since there was no point in blindfolding the master if the coachman kept his eyes open and recognized the streets through which they would pass.
075.082 "--What to do then?" asked the general.
075.083 "--I have my car," said the president.
075.084 "--Are you so sure of your coachman that you entrust to him a secret that you judge imprudent to tell to mine?
075.085 "--Our coachman is a member of the club," said the president; "we shall be driven by a state councilor.
075.086 "--Then," said the general, laughing, "we run another risk, that of pouring."
075.087 "We record this joke as proof that the general was not in the least forced to attend the session, and that he came of his own free will."
075.088 "Once in the car, the president reminded the general of the promise he had made to allow himself to be blindfolded. The general made no objection to this formality: a scarf, prepared for this purpose in the car, did the trick.
075.089 "During the drive, the president thought he saw that the general was trying to look under his blindfold: he reminded him of his oath.
075.090 "--Ah, that's right," said the general.
075.091 "The carriage stopped in front of an alley of the Rue Saint-Jacques. The general got out, leaning on the arm of the president, whose dignity he did not know, and whom he took to be a simple member of the club; they crossed the alley, went up one floor, and entered the deliberation room.
075.092 "The meeting had begun. The members of the club, who had been informed of the kind of presentation that was to take place that evening, were in full attendance. Arrived in the middle of the room, the general was invited to remove his blindfold. He immediately accepted the invitation, and seemed very surprised to find such a large number of acquaintances in a society whose existence he had not even suspected until then.
075.093 "He was questioned about his feelings, but he contented himself with answering that the letters from Elba must have made them known...."
075.094 Franz interrupted himself.
075.095 "My father was a royalist, he said; one did not need to question him about his feelings, they were known.
075.096 --And from this," said Villefort, "came my liaison with your father, my dear Monsieur Franz; one binds oneself easily when one shares the same opinions."
075.097 "Read," continued the old man's eye.
075.098 Franz continued:
075.099 "The president then took the floor to urge the general to speak more explicitly; but M. de Quesnel replied that he wished above all to know what was desired of him.
075.100 "It was then given communication to the general of this same letter of the island of Elba which recommended him to the club as a man on whose assistance one could count. A whole paragraph exposed the probable return from the island of Elba, and promised a new letter and more ample details with the arrival of the _Pharaon_, building belonging to the shipowner Morrel, of Marseilles, and whose captain was with the whole devotion of the emperor.
075.101 "During the whole of this reading, the general, on whom one had thought one could count as a brother, gave instead visible signs of discontent and repugnance.
075.102 "When the reading was over, he remained silent and frowned.
075.103 "--Well," asked the president, "what do you say to this letter, General?
075.104 "--I say that it was not long ago," he replied, "that the oath was taken to King Louis XVIII, only to be violated already for the benefit of the ex-emperor."
075.105 "This time the answer was too clear for anyone to mistake his sentiments.
075.106 "--General," said the president, "there is no more for us a King Louis XVIII than there is an ex-emperor. There is only His Majesty the Emperor and King, removed for ten months from France, his State, by violence and treason.
075.107 "-Pardon, gentlemen," said the general; "there may not be a King Louis XVIII for you, but there is one for me: since he made me a baron and a marshal of camp, and I will never forget that it is to his happy return to France that I owe these two titles.
075.108 "--Monsieur, said the president in the most serious tone and while rising, take care of what you say; your words show us clearly that one was mistaken on your account with the island of Elba and that one deceived us. The communication which was made to you has to do with the confidence which one had in you, and consequently with a feeling which honors you. Now we were in error: a title and a rank rallied you to the new government which we want to overthrow. We will not compel you to lend us your support; we will not enlist anyone against his conscience and his will; but we will compel you to act as a gallant man, even if you are not willing to do so.
075.109 "--You call being a gentleman knowing your conspiracy and not revealing it! I call that being your accomplice. You see that I am even more frank than you are ....
075.110 "Ah, father," said Franz, interrupting himself, "I understand now why they murdered you."
075.111 Valentine could not help glancing at Franz; the young man was truly beautiful in his filial enthusiasm.
075.112 Villefort walked up and down behind him.
075.113 Noirtier followed with his eyes the expression of each one, and kept his dignified and severe attitude.
075.114 Franz returned to the manuscript and continued:
075.115 "--Sir," said the president, "you were asked to go to the assembly, you were not dragged there by force; you were offered a blindfold, you accepted. When you acceded to this double request you knew perfectly well that we were not concerned with securing the throne of Louis XVIII, otherwise we would not have taken so much care to hide ourselves from the police. Now, you understand it, it would be too convenient to put on a mask with the help of which one surprises the secret of the people, and to have then only to remove this mask to lose those who trusted you. No, no, you will first say frankly whether you are for the king of chance who reigns at the moment, or for His Majesty the Emperor.
075.116 "--I am a royalist," replied the general; "I have sworn an oath to Louis XVIII, I will keep my oath.
075.117 "These words were followed by a general murmur, and one could see by the looks of a great number of the members of the club that they were agitating the question of making M. d'Epinay repent of these imprudent words.
075.118 "The president rose again and imposed silence.
075.119 "-Monsieur," he said to him, "you are too serious a man and too sensible not to understand the consequences of the situation in which we find ourselves in front of one another, and your very frankness dictates to us the conditions that we have left to make to you: you will therefore swear on your honor not to reveal anything of what you have heard.
075.120 "The general raised his hand to his sword and exclaimed:
075.121 "--If you speak of honor, begin by not disregarding its laws, and impose nothing by violence.
075.122 "--And you, sir," continued the president, with a calm that was perhaps more terrible than the general's anger, "do not touch your sword; that is an advice I give you.
075.123 "The general turned around him with glances that revealed a beginning of anxiety. However, he did not yield yet; on the contrary, recalling all his strength:
075.124 "--I will not swear, he said.
075.125 "--Then, sir, you will die," replied the president calmly.
075.126 "M. d'Épinay became very pale: he looked around him a second time; several members of the club were whispering and looking for weapons under their coats.
075.127 "--General," said the president, "be at ease; you are among people of honor who will try every means to convince you before going against you to the last extremity, but also, as you have said, you are among conspirators, you hold our secret, it must be returned to us."
075.128 "A silence full of meaning followed these words, and as the general answered nothing:
075.129 "--Close the doors, said the president to the ushers.
075.130 "The same deadly silence followed his words.
075.131 "Then the general stepped forward, and making a violent effort on himself:
075.132 "--I have a son, he said, and I must think of him while I am among assassins.
075.133 "--General," said the leader of the assembly nobly, "one man always has the right to insult fifty: it is the privilege of weakness. Only he is wrong to use this right. Believe me, General, swear and do not insult us.
075.134 "The general, once again tamed by this superiority of the leader of the assembly, hesitated for a moment; but finally, advancing to the president's desk, he said
075.135 "--What is the formula?" he asked.
075.136 "--Here it is:
075.137 "--I swear on honor never to reveal to anyone in the world what I saw and heard on February 5, 1815, between nine and ten o'clock at night, and I declare that I deserve death if I violate my oath.
075.138 "The general seemed to experience a nervous shudder which prevented him from answering for a few seconds; finally, overcoming an obvious reluctance, he pronounced the required oath, but in a voice so low that it was barely heard: so several members demanded that he repeat it in a louder and more distinct voice, which was done.
075.139 "--Now I wish to retire," said the general; "am I free at last?
075.140 "The president rose, designated three members of the assembly to accompany him, and got into the car with the general, after having blindfolded him. Among these three members was the coachman who had brought him.
075.141 "The other members of the club separated in silence.
075.142 "--Where do you want us to drive you?" asked the president.
075.143 "--Anywhere I can be delivered from your presence," replied M. d'Épinay.
075.144 "-Monsieur," then resumed the president, "beware, you are no longer in the assembly, you are dealing only with isolated men; do not insult them if you do not want to be made responsible for the insult.
075.145 "But instead of understanding this language, M. d'Épinay replied:
075.146 "--You are always as brave in your carriage as you are in your club, by the reason, sir, that four men are always stronger than one."
075.147 "The president stopped the car.
075.148 "We were just at the entrance to the Quai des Ormes, where the stairway down to the river is.
075.149 "--Why are you stopping here?" asked M. d'Épinay.
075.150 "--Because, sir," said the president, "you have insulted a man, and this man does not want to take another step without loyally asking you for separation.
075.151 "--Another way of murder," said the general, shrugging his shoulders.
075.152 "--Don't make any noise," replied the president, "if you don't want me to look at you yourself as one of those men you were pointing out just now, that is to say, as a coward who takes his weakness as a shield. You are alone, only one will answer you; you have a sword at your side, I have one in this cane; you have no witness, one of these gentlemen will be yours. Now, if it suits you, you can take off your blindfold.
075.153 "The general immediately tore off the handkerchief that he had over his eyes.
075.154 "--Finally," he said, "I will know then who I am dealing with."
075.155 "The car was opened: the four men got out...."
075.156 Franz paused again. He wiped a cold sweat from his forehead; there was something frightening in seeing the son, trembling and pale, reading aloud the details, hitherto unknown, of his father's death.
075.157 Valentine joined her hands as if in prayer.
075.158 Noirtier looked at Villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and pride.
075.159 Franz continued:
075.160 "It was, as we have said, the 5th of February. For three days it had been freezing at five or six degrees; the staircase was all stiff with ice, the general was fat and tall, the president offered him the side of the banister to go down.
075.161 "The two witnesses followed from behind.
075.162 "It was a dark night, the ground from the stairs to the river was wet with snow and frost, one could see the water flowing, black, deep and carrying some ice cubes.
075.163 "One of the witnesses fetched a lantern from a coal boat, and by the light of this lantern they examined the weapons.
075.164 "The sword of the president, which was simply, as he had said, a sword that he carried in a cane, was shorter than that of his opponent, and had no guard.
075.165 "General d'Epinay proposed drawing lots for the two swords: but the president replied that it was he who had provoked, and that in provoking he had claimed that each one would use his weapons.
075.166 "The witnesses tried to insist; the president imposed silence on them.
075.167 "The lantern was placed on the ground: the two adversaries placed themselves on each side; the fight began.
075.168 "The light made two flashes from the two swords. As for the men, one could hardly see them, so thick was the shadow.
075.169 "Mr. General passed for one of the best blades of the army. But he was pressed so hard from the first boots that he broke; in breaking he fell.
075.170 "The witnesses thought he was killed; but his adversary, who knew he had not been hit, offered him his hand to help him up. This circumstance, instead of calming him, irritated the general, who in turn attacked his adversary.
075.171 "But his adversary did not break stride, receiving him on his sword. Three times the general retreated, finding himself too involved, and returned to the charge.
075.172 "At the third time, he fell again.
075.173 "It was thought that he slipped as the first time; however, the witnesses, seeing that he did not get up, approached him and tried to put him back on his feet; but the one who had taken him by the arm felt a wet heat under his hand. It was blood.
075.174 "The general, who had almost fainted, regained his senses.
075.175 "--Ah!" he said, "they have sent me some spadassin, some master-at-arms of the regiment.
075.176 "The president, without answering, approached the one of the two witnesses who was holding the lantern and, raising his sleeve, he showed his arm pierced by two sword blows; then, opening his habit and unbuttoning his vest, he showed his flank cut by a third wound.
075.177 "However, he had not even sighed.
075.178 "General d'Épinay entered into agony and expired five minutes later...."
075.179 Franz read these last words in a voice so strangled, that they could hardly be heard; and after reading them he stopped, passing his hand over his eyes as if to drive a cloud from them.
075.180 But, after a moment's silence, he continued:
075.181 "The president went up the stairs, having pushed his sword back into his cane; a trail of blood marked his path in the snow. He was not yet at the top of the stairs, when he heard a dull splash in the water: it was the body of the general that the witnesses had just thrown into the river after having ascertained his death.
075.182 "The general had therefore died in a fair duel, and not in an ambush, as one might say.
075.183 "In witness whereof we have signed the present to establish the truth of the facts, lest the time come when one of the actors in this terrible scene is accused of premeditated murder or of breaking the laws of honor.
075.184 "_Signed_: BEAUREGARD, DUCHAMPY AND LECHARPEL."
075.185 When Franz had finished this reading, so terrible for a son, when Valentine, pale with emotion, had wiped away a tear, when Villefort, trembling and huddled in a corner, had tried to ward off the storm by imploring glances addressed to the implacable old man:
075.186 "Monsieur," said d'Épinay to Noirtier, "since you know this terrible story in all its details, since you have had it attested by honorable signatures, since at last you seem to be interested in me, though your interest has as yet been revealed only by sorrow, do not refuse me one last satisfaction; tell me the name of the president of the club, that I may at last know him who killed my poor father."
075.187 Villefort sought, as if lost, for the door knob. Valentine, who had understood the old man's answer before anyone else, and who had often noticed on his forearm the trace of two sword strokes, took a step back.
075.188 "In the name of Heaven!" said Franz, addressing his fiancée, "join me, that I may know the name of that man who made me an orphan at two years of age."
075.189 Valentine remained motionless and mute.
075.190 "Here, sir," said Villefort, "believe me, do not prolong this horrible scene; the names, moreover, have been hidden on purpose. My father himself does not know this president, and, if he does, he would not know how to say it: proper names are not found in the dictionary.
075.191 --Oh, woe!" cried Franz, "the only hope that sustained me during all this reading and gave me the strength to go on to the end, was to know at least the name of the man who killed my father! Sir! sir!" he cried, turning back to Noirtier, "in the name of Heaven! do what you can... succeed, I beg you, in indicating to me, in making me understand ....
075.192 --Yes," replied Noirtier.
075.193 -- Oh mademoiselle, mademoiselle!" cried Franz, "your grandfather has made a sign that he can point out to me... this man.... Help me... you understand it... lend me your assistance."
075.194 Noirtier looked at the dictionary.
075.195 Franz took it with a nervous tremble, and pronounced successively the letters of the alphabet up to M.
075.196 At this letter the old man nodded.
075.197 "M!" repeated Franz.
075.198 The young man's finger slid over the words; but at every word Noirtier answered with a negative sign. Valentine hid his head in his hands. Finally Franz arrived at the word ME.
075.199 "Yes," said the old man.
075.200 --You!" exclaimed Franz, whose hair stood on end; "you, Monsieur Noirtier! are you the one who killed my father?
075.201 --Yes," replied Noirtier, fixing a majestic look on the young man.
075.202 Franz fell helplessly into an armchair.
075.203 Villefort opened the door and fled, for the idea had come to him of smothering that little bit of existence which still remained in the old man's terrible heart.
076.000 The progress of Cavalcanti fils.
076.001 However Mr. Cavalcanti father had left to go to take again his service, not in the army of His Majesty the Emperor of Austria, but at the roulette of the baths of Lucca, of which he was one of the most assiduous courtiers.
076.002 It goes without saying that he had carried away with the most scrupulous exactitude to the last paul of the sum which had been allotted to him for his voyage, and for the reward of the majestic and solemn way with which he had played his role of father.
076.003 M. Andrea had inherited at this departure of all the papers which established that he had indeed the honor to be the son of the marquis Bartolomeo and the marquise Leonora Corsinari.
076.004 He was thus more or less anchored in this Parisian society, so easy to receive the foreigners, and to treat them, not according to what they are, but according to what they want to be.
076.005 Besides, what is required of a young man in Paris? To speak more or less his own language, to be properly dressed, to be a good sport and to pay in gold.
076.006 It goes without saying that one is even less difficult for a foreigner than for a Parisian.
076.007 Andrea had thus taken in two weeks a rather beautiful position; one called him sir the count, one said that he had fifty thousand livres of income, and one spoke about the immense treasures of his father, buried, it was said, in the careers of Saravezza.
076.008 A scholar, before whom this last circumstance was mentioned as a fact, declared to have seen the quarries of which it was spoken, which gave a great weight to assertions until then floating in the state of doubt, and which from then on took the consistency of the reality.
076.009 It was at this point in the circle of Parisian society to which we have introduced our readers, when Monte Cristo came one evening to visit Mr. Danglars. Mr. Danglars had gone out, but it was proposed to the Count to introduce him to the Baroness, who was visible, which he accepted.
076.010 It was never without a sort of nervous twitch that, since the dinner at Auteuil and the events that had followed, Mrs. Danglars heard the name Monte Cristo pronounced. If the presence of the count did not follow the sound of his name, the painful sensation became more intense; if on the contrary the count appeared, his open face, his bright eyes, his friendliness, his gallantry even for Mme; It seemed to the baroness impossible that a man so charming on the surface could harbor evil designs against her; besides, the most corrupt hearts can believe in evil only by resting it on some interest; useless and causeless evil is repugnant as an anomaly.
076.011 When Monte Cristo entered the boudoir into which we have already once introduced our readers, and where the baroness was following with a rather anxious eye the drawings which her daughter was passing to her after having looked at them with Mr. Cavalcanti, son, his presence produced its ordinary effect, and it was with a smile that, after having been somewhat upset by his name, the baroness received the count.
076.012 This one, on his side, embraced all the scene of a glance.
076.013 Close to the baroness, about lying on a loveseat, Eugenie was sitting, and Cavalcanti standing.
076.014 Cavalcanti, dressed in black like one of Goethe's heroes, in varnished shoes and white silk stockings, passed a rather white and rather neat hand through his blond hair, in the middle of which glittered a diamond that, in spite of Monte Cristo's advice, the vain young man had not been able to resist the desire to put on his little finger.
076.015 This movement was accompanied by murderous glances thrown at Mlle Danglars, and sighs sent to the same address as the glances.
076.016 Mlle Danglars was always the same, that is to say, beautiful, cold and mocking. Not one of these glances, not one of these sighs of Andrea escaped to him, one would have said that they slipped on the armour of Minerva, armour which some philosophers claim to cover sometimes the chest of Sapho.
076.017 Eugenie greeted the Count coldly, and took advantage of the first preoccupations of the conversation to retire to her study salon, from which two voices soon exhaled laughing and noisy, mingled with the first chords of a piano, let Monte Cristo know that Mlle. Danglars had just preferred, to his own and to that of M. Cavalcanti, the society of Mlle. Louise d'Armilly, his singing mistress.
076.018 It was then especially that, while chatting with Mrs. Danglars and appearing absorbed by the charm of the conversation, the count noticed the solicitude of Mr. Andrea Cavalcanti, his way of going to listen to the music at the door which he did not dare to cross, and of showing his admiration.
076.019 Soon the banker returned. His first glance was for Monte Cristo, it is true, but the second for Andrea.
076.020 As for his wife, he greeted her in the way that some husbands greet their wives, and of which single people will only be able to form an idea when a very extensive code of conjugality has been published.
076.021 "Didn't these ladies invite you to play music with them?" asked Danglars to Andrea.
076.022 --Alas! no, sir," answered Andrea with a sigh even more remarkable than the others.
076.023 Danglars went at once to the door of communication and opened it.
076.024 One saw then the two young girls sitting on the same seat, in front of the same piano. They were each accompanying with one hand, an exercise to which they had become accustomed by fancy, and in which they had become remarkably strong.
076.025 Mlle. d'Armilly, who could be seen at the time, forming with Eugenie, thanks to the frame of the door, one of those tableaux vivants such as are often made in Germany, was of a rather remarkable beauty, or rather of an exquisite kindness. She was a small, slim woman, blonde as a fairy, with large curly hair falling on her neck, a little too long, as Perugino sometimes gives to his virgins, and eyes veiled by fatigue. It was said that she had a weak chest, and that, like Antonia of the _Violone de Cremona_, she would die one day while singing.
076.026 Monte Cristo plunged into this gynecology with a quick and curious glance; it was the first time he had seen Mlle. d'Armilly, of whom he had so often heard in the house.
076.027 "Well," asked the banker to his daughter, "are we excluded, then?"
076.028 Then he led the young man into the small salon, and, either by chance or by skill, behind Andrea the door was pushed back so that, from where they were seated, Monte Cristo and the baroness could see nothing more, but, as the banker had followed Andrea, Mme. Danglars did not even seem to notice this circumstance.
076.029 Soon after, the count heard Andrea's voice resounding to the chords of the piano, accompanying a Corsican song.
076.030 While the Count listened with a smile to this song, which made him forget Andrea and remind him of Benedetto, Madame Danglars praised to Monte Cristo the fortitude of her husband, who, only that morning, had lost three or four hundred thousand francs in a Milanese bankruptcy.
076.031 And, indeed, the praise was deserved; for, if the Count had not known it from the baroness, or perhaps from one of the means he had of knowing everything, the baron's face would not have told him a word of it.
076.032 "Good!" thought Monte Cristo, "he is already hiding what he is losing: a month ago he was bragging about it.
076.033 Then out loud:
076.034 "Oh, madam," said the Count, "M. Danglars knows the Stock Exchange so well that he will always make up there what he can lose elsewhere.
076.035 --I see that you share the common error, said Madame Danglars.
076.036 --And what is this error?" said Monte Cristo.
076.037 --It is that M. Danglars plays, while on the contrary he never plays.
076.038 --Ah, yes, it is true, madam, I remember that M. Debray told me... By the way, what has become of Mr. Debray? It is three or four days since I last saw him.
076.039 --And so have I," said Madame Danglars with miraculous aplomb. But you began a sentence which remained unfinished.
076.040 --What is it?
076.041 --Mr. Debray told you, you said....
076.042 --Ah! it's true; Mr. Debray told me that it was you who were sacrificing to the demon of the game.
076.043 --I had this taste for some time, I confess," said Mrs. Danglars, "but I no longer have it.
076.044 --And you are wrong, madam. My God! the chances of fortune are precarious, and if I were a woman, and if chance had made this wife that of a banker, whatever confidence I have in my husband's happiness, for in speculation, as you know, everything is happiness and misfortune; well, I say, whatever confidence I have in my husband's happiness, I would always begin by securing my own independent fortune, even if I were to acquire this fortune by placing my interests in hands that would be unfamiliar to him.
076.045 Mrs. Danglars blushed despite herself.
076.046 "Here," said Monte-Cristo, as if he had seen nothing, "there is talk of a fine trick that was done yesterday on the bonds of Naples.
076.047 --I have none," said the baroness sharply, "and I have never had any; but, in truth, it is enough to talk about the stock market as it is, Monsieur le Comte, we look like two stockbrokers; let us speak a little of these poor Villeforts, who are so tormented at the moment by fate.
076.048 --What is happening to them?" asked Monte Cristo with perfect naivety.
076.049 --But you know it; after having lost M. de Saint-Méran three or four days after his departure, they have just lost the marquise three or four days after her arrival.
076.050 --Ah, it is true, said Monte Cristo, I have learned that; but as Clodius said to Hamlet, it is a law of nature: their fathers had died before them, and they had mourned them; they will die before their sons, and their sons will mourn them.
076.051 --But that's not all.
076.052 --How is that not the whole thing?
076.053 --No; you knew they were going to marry their daughter....
076.054 --Mr. Franz d'Épinay.... Is the wedding missed?
076.055 --Yesterday morning, it seems, Franz gave them their word.
076.056 --Ah! really.... And do we know the causes of this break?
076.057 --No.
076.058 --What do you announce to me there, good God! and M. de Villefort, how does he accept all these misfortunes?
076.059 --As always, as a philosopher."
076.060 At this moment Danglars returned alone.
076.061 "Well," said the baroness, "you leave M. Cavalcanti with your daughter?
076.062 --And Mlle. d'Armilly, said the banker, for whom do you take her?
076.063 Then turning to Monte Cristo:
076.064 "Charming young man, isn't he, Monsieur le Comte, that Prince Cavalcanti?... Only, is he really a prince?
076.065 --I do not answer for it, said Monte-Cristo. I was presented to his father as a marquis, he would be a count; but I believe that he himself has no great claim to that title.
076.066 -Why? said the banker. If he is a prince, he is wrong not to boast. Everyone has his right. I don't like it when people deny their origin.
076.067 --Oh! you are a pure democrat, said Monte Cristo, smiling.
076.068 --But see, said the baroness, what you are exposing yourself to: If M. de Morcerf came by chance, he would find M. Cavalcanti in a room where he, Eugenie's fiancé, has never been allowed to enter.
076.069 --You do well to say by chance," said the banker, "for, in truth, one would say, so rarely do we see him, that it is indeed chance that brings him to us.
076.070 -- Well, if he came and found this young man near your daughter, he might be displeased.
076.071 --Him? oh, my God! you are mistaken, Mr. Albert does not do us the honor of being jealous of his fiancée, he does not love her enough for that. Besides, what does it matter to me whether he is dissatisfied or not!
076.072 --However, at this point we are....
076.073 --Yes, to the point: do you want to know, to the point? that at his mother's ball he danced once with my daughter, that Mr. Cavalcanti danced three times with her, and that he didn't even notice it.
076.074 --Mr. Viscount Albert de Morcerf!" announced the valet.
076.075 The baroness rose briskly. She was going to pass to the drawing room of studies to warn her daughter, when Danglars stopped her by the arm.
076.076 "Leave," he said.
076.077 She looked at him astonished.
076.078 Monte-Cristo pretended not to have seen this play.
076.079 Albert entered, he was very beautiful and very merry. He greeted the baroness with ease, Danglars with familiarity, Monte Cristo with affection; then turning to the baroness:
076.080 "Will you allow me, madam," he said, "to ask you how Miss Danglars is doing?
076.081 --Fortunately, sir," replied Danglars, "she is at the moment making music in her little salon with Mr. Cavalcanti."
076.082 Albert kept his calm and indifferent air: perhaps he felt some interior spite; but he felt Monte Cristo's gaze fixed on him.
076.083 "Mr. Cavalcanti has a very fine tenor voice," he said, "and Miss Eugenie a magnificent soprano, not to mention that she plays the piano like Thalberg. It must be a charming concert.
076.084 --The fact is, said Danglars, that they match up wonderfully."
076.085 Albert seemed not to have noticed this equivocation, so crude, however, that Mrs. Danglars blushed.
076.086 "I, too," continued the young man, "am a musician, at least as far as my masters say; well, strange thing, I have never yet been able to tune my voice with any voice, and with soprano voices especially even less than with the others."
076.087 Danglars made a little smile that meant: But get angry!
076.088 "Also," he said, hoping no doubt to achieve the goal he desired, "the prince and my daughter were the general admiration yesterday. Were you not there yesterday, Monsieur de Morcerf?
076.089 --What prince?" asked Albert.
076.090 --Prince Cavalcanti," said Danglars, who still insisted on giving the young man that title.
076.091 --Ah! pardon, said Albert, I did not know he was a prince. Ah! Prince Cavalcanti sang yesterday with Miss Eugenie? In truth, it must have been delightful, and I regret very much not having heard it. But I could not go to your invitation, I was forced to accompany Mme. de Morcerf to the Baroness de Château-Renaud's, the mother, where the Germans were singing."
076.092 Then, after a silence, and as if there had been no question of anything:
076.093 "Will I be permitted," repeated Morcerf, "to pay my respects to Mlle. Danglars?
076.094 --Oh! wait, wait, I beg you," said the banker, stopping the young man; "can you hear the delicious cavatina, ta, ta, ta, ti, ti, ta, ta, ta, it's ravishing, it's going to be over... one second: perfect! bravo! bravi! brava!"
076.095 And the banker began to applaud frantically.
076.096 "Indeed," said Albert, "it is exquisite, and it is impossible to understand the music of one's country better than Prince Cavalcanti does. You said prince, didn't you? Besides, if he is not a prince, he will be made a prince, that's easy in Italy. But to return to our lovely singers, you should do us a favor, Mr. Danglars: without warning them that there is a stranger there, you should ask Mlle. Danglars and Mr. Cavalcanti to start another piece. It is such a delightful thing to enjoy music from a little distance, in a half-light, without being seen, without seeing, and, therefore, without disturbing the musician, who can thus give himself up to all the instinct of his genius or to all the impulse of his heart."
076.097 This time Danglars was dismantled by the young man's phlegm.
076.098 He took Monte Cristo aside.
076.099 "Well," he said, "what do you say about our lover!
076.100 --Dame! He seems cold to me, that is undeniable, but what do you want? you are engaged!
076.101 --Surely I am committed, but to give my daughter to a man who loves her and not to a man who does not. See this one, cold as a marble, proud like his father; if he were still rich, if he had the fortune of the Cavalcanti, we would pass over it. Well, I did not consult my daughter; but if she had good taste ....
076.102 --Oh!" said Monte Cristo, "I don't know whether it is my friendship for him that blinds me, but I assure you that M. de Morcerf is a charming young man who will make your daughter happy and who will sooner or later achieve something; for after all, her father's position is excellent.
076.103 --Hum!" said Danglars.
076.104 --Why this doubt?
076.105 --There is always the past--that obscure past.
076.106 --But the father's past is not the son's business.
076.107 --So done, so done!
076.108 --Let's see, don't get worked up; a month ago, you thought it was excellent to have this wedding.... You understand, I am desperate: it is at my place that you saw this young Cavalcanti, whom I do not know, I repeat to you.
076.109 --I know him, says Danglars, that is enough.
076.110 --Do you know him? Have you made inquiries about him? asked Monte Cristo.
076.111 -- Is there any need for that, and at first sight does one not know who one is dealing with? He is rich first of all.
076.112 -- I do not assure him.
076.113 --You answer for him, though?
076.114 --Fifty thousand pounds, a pittance.
076.115 --He has a distinguished education.
076.116 --Hum!" said Monte Cristo in turn.
076.117 -- He is a musician.
076.118 --All Italians are.
076.119 --Hold on Count, you are not fair to this young man.
076.120 --Well, yes, I confess, I see with sorrow that, knowing your engagements with the Morcerfs, he should thus come to throw himself across and abuse his fortune."
076.121 Danglars began to laugh.
076.122 "Oh, how puritanical you are!" he said, "but that is done every day in the world.
076.123 --You cannot, however, break up like that, my dear Monsieur Danglars: the Morcerfs are counting on this marriage.
076.124 --Are they counting on it?
076.125 --Positively.
076.126 --So let them explain themselves. You should slip two words of this to the father, my dear count, you who are so well in the house.
076.127 --Me! And where on earth did you see that?
076.128 --But at their ball, I think. How! the Countess, the proud Mercedes, the disdainful Catalan, who scarcely deigns to open her mouth to her oldest acquaintances, took you by the arm, went out with you into the garden, took the little alleys, and did not come back until half an hour later.
076.129 --Ah! baron, baron, said Albert, you are preventing us from hearing: for a music lover like you, what barbarity!
076.130 - "That's good, that's good," said Danglars.
076.131 Then turning back to Monte Cristo:
076.132 "Will you tell him that, the father?
076.133 --Willingly, if you wish.
076.134 --But let it be done in an explicit and definitive manner, especially that he ask for my daughter, that he set a time, that he declare his conditions for money, finally that we agree or that we fall out; but, you understand, no more delays.
076.135 -- Well, the procedure will be done.
076.136 --I won't say that I await it with pleasure, but I do await it: a banker, as you know, must be a slave to his word."
076.137 And Danglars uttered one of those sighs which Cavalcanti fils had uttered half an hour before.
076.138 "Bravi! bravo! brava!" cried Morcerf, parodying the banker and applauding the end of the piece.
076.139 Danglars was beginning to look at Albert sideways, when two words came to him in a low voice.
076.140 "I'll be right back," said the banker to Monte Cristo, "wait for me, I may have something to tell you later.
076.141 And he left.
076.142 The baroness took advantage of her husband's absence to push open the door of her daughter's study, and M. Andrea, who was sitting at the piano with Miss Eugenie, was seen to rise like a spring.
076.143 Albert smilingly greeted Miss Danglars, who, without appearing in any way disturbed, returned his greeting as coolly as usual.
076.144 Cavalcanti appeared obviously embarrassed, and saluted Morcerf, who returned his greeting with the most impertinent air in the world.
076.145 Then Albert began to confound himself in praise of Mlle. Danglars' voice, and of the regret he felt, from what he had just heard, at not having attended the previous evening....
076.146 Cavalcanti, left to himself, took Monte Cristo aside.
076.147 "Let's see," said Madame Danglars, "enough music and compliments like this, come and have tea.
076.148 -- "Come, Louise," said Miss Danglars to her friend.
076.149 They passed into the next room, where tea was indeed being prepared. At the moment when one started to leave, in the English manner, the spoons in the cups, the door reopened, and Danglars reappeared visibly very agitated.
076.150 Monte Cristo especially noticed this agitation and questioned the banker with his eyes.
076.151 "Well," said Danglars, "I have just received my mail from Greece.
076.152 --Ah! ah!" said the Count, "is that why you were called?
076.153 --How is King Otto doing?" asked Albert in his most cheerful tone.
076.154 Danglars looked at him sideways without answering, and Monte Cristo turned away to hide the expression of pity that had just appeared on his face and which faded almost immediately.
076.155 "We will go away together, won't we?" said Albert to the Count.
076.156 -- "Yes, if you like," replied the latter.
076.157 Albert could not understand this look of the banker's; so he turned to Monte Cristo, who had understood perfectly:
076.158 "Did you see," he said, "how he looked at me?
076.159 --Yes," replied the Count, "but do you find anything peculiar in his look?
076.160 --I think so; but what does he mean with his news from Greece?
076.161 --How do you want me to know that?
076.162 --Because, I presume, you have intelligences in the country."
076.163 Monte Cristo smiled as one always smiles when one wants to dispense with an answer.
076.164 "Here," said Albert, "here he comes to you, I'm going to compliment Mlle. Danglars on her cameo; meanwhile, the father will have time to talk to you.
076.165 --If you compliment her, compliment her on her voice, at least, said Monte Cristo.
076.166 --No, that is what anyone would do.
076.167 --Mon cher vicomte, said Monte Cristo, you have the fatuity of impertinence."
076.168 Albert advanced toward Eugenie with a smile on his lips. Meanwhile, Danglars leaned into the ear of the count.
076.169 "You have given me excellent advice," he said, "and there is a whole horrible story about these two words: Fernand and Janina.
076.170 --Ah bah!" said Monte Cristo.
076.171 --Yes, I will tell you that; but take the young man away: I would be too embarrassed to stay with him now.
076.172 -I do, he accompanies me; now, must I always send you the father?
076.173 --More than ever.
076.174 --Good."
076.175 The Count made a sign to Albert. Both saluted the ladies and went out: Albert with an air of perfect indifference to Mlle. Danglars' scorn; Monte Cristo reiterating to Mme. Danglars his advice about the prudence a banker's wife should have in securing her future.
076.176 M. Cavalcanti remained master of the battlefield.
077.000 Haydée.
077.001 No sooner had the Count's horses turned the corner of the boulevard, than Albert turned back to the Count, bursting into a laugh that was too loud not to be a little forced.
077.002 "Well," he said to him, "I will ask you, as King Charles IX asked Catherine de Medici after the St. Bartholomew's Day: How do you think I played my little part?"
077.003 --In what respect?" asked Monte Cristo.
077.004 --But about the installation of my rival at Mr. Danglars' house....
077.005 --What rival?
077.006 --Parbleu! What rival? Your protégé, Mr. Andrea Cavalcanti!
077.007 --Oh! no bad jokes, viscount; I do not protect M. Andrea at all, at least near M. Danglars.
077.008 --And that is the reproach I would make to you if the young man needed protection. But, fortunately for me, he can do without it.
077.009 --How can you think he's courting?
077.010 -- I can tell you: he rolls his eyes like a suitor and makes the sounds of a lover; he longs for the hand of the proud Eugenie. Here, I have just made a verse! Word of honor, it is not my fault. Anyway, I repeat: he aspires to the hand of the proud Eugenie.
077.011 --What does it matter, if one thinks only of you?
077.012 -- Don't say that, my dear Count; I am being bullied on both sides.
077.013 --How, on both sides?
077.014 --Without a doubt: Mlle. Eugenie barely answered me, and Mlle. d'Armilly, her confidante, did not answer me at all.
077.015 --Yes, but the father adores you, said Monte Cristo.
077.016 --Him? but on the contrary, he thrust a thousand daggers into my heart; daggers that fit into the handle, it is true, daggers of tragedy, but which he believed to be real.
077.017 -The jealousy indicates the affection.
077.018 --Yes, but I am not jealous.
077.019 --He is.
077.020 --From whom? From Debray?
077.021 --No, of you.
077.022 --From me? I bet that within a week he closed the door in my face.
077.023 --You are mistaken, my dear viscount.
077.024 --Proof?
077.025 --Do you want it?
077.026 --Yes.
077.027 --I am instructed to ask the Count de Morcerf to make a definite approach to the Baron.
077.028 --By whom?
077.029 --Per the baron himself.
077.030 --Oh! said Albert with all the cuddliness of which he was capable, you will not do that, will you, my dear Count?
077.031 --You are mistaken, Albert, I will do it, since I have promised.
077.032 --Come on, said Albert with a sigh, it seems that you absolutely want to marry me.
077.033 -- I want to be good to everyone; but, about Debray, I don't see him at the Baroness' anymore.
077.034 -- There is a quarrel.
077.035 --With Madame?
077.036 -- No, with the gentleman.
077.037 --So he has noticed something?
077.038 --Ah! the good joke!
077.039 --Do you think he suspected it?" said Monte Cristo with charming naivety.
077.040 --Ah, but where are you coming from, my dear Count?
077.041 --From the Congo, if you like.
077.042 --That's not far enough.
077.043 --Do I know your Parisian husbands?
077.044 --Eh! my dear Count, husbands are the same everywhere; from the moment you have studied the individual in any country, you know the race.
077.045 --But then what cause could Danglars and Debray have fallen out? They seemed to get along so well," said Monte Cristo with renewed naivety.
077.046 --Ah, there! we are entering the mysteries of Isis, and I am not initiated. When Mr. Cavalcanti son is one of the family, you will ask him that.
077.047 The car stopped.
077.048 "Here we are," said Monte Cristo; "it is only half past ten, so get in.
077.049 --Gladly.
077.050 --My carriage will take you.
077.051 --No, thank you, my coupe must have followed us.
077.052 --In effect, there it is," said Monte Cristo, jumping to the ground.
077.053 Both entered the house; the living room was lit, they went in.
077.054 "You're going to make us some tea, Baptistin," said Monte Cristo.
077.055 Baptistin left without uttering a word. Two seconds later, he reappeared with a tray all served, and which, like the snacks of the fairy plays, seemed to come out of the ground.
077. 056 "In truth," said Morcerf, "what I admire in you, my dear Count, is not your wealth; perhaps there are people richer than you; it is not your spirit; Beaumarchais had no more, but he had as much; It is your way of being served, without being answered a word, by the minute, by the second, as if one guessed, by the way you ring, what you wish to have, and as if what you wish to have was always ready.
077.057 --That which you say is a little true. One knows my habits. For example, you'll see: don't you want to do something while you drink your tea?
077.058 --Forgive me, I want to smoke."
077.059 Monte Cristo approached the bell and struck a blow.
077.060 After a second, a particular door opened, and Ali appeared with two chibouques all stuffed with excellent latakia.
077.061 "That's wonderful," said Morcerf.
077.062 -But no, it is quite simple," continued Monte Cristo; "Ali knows that I usually smoke while taking tea or coffee: he knows that I asked for tea, he knows that I have returned with you, he hears that I am calling him, he suspects the cause, and as he comes from a country where hospitality is exercised with the pipe above all, instead of one shibboleth, he brings two.
077.063 --Certainly, it is an explanation like any other; but it is not less true that there is only you.... Oh, but, what do I hear?"
077.064 And Morcerf inclined towards the door, through which sounds corresponding to those of a guitar were indeed entering.
077.065 "My goodness, my dear viscount, you are devoted to music tonight; you escape from Miss Danglars' piano only to fall into Haydée's guzla.
077.066 --Haydée! what an adorable name! So there are women who are really called Haydée somewhere else than in Lord Byron's poems?
077.067 --Certainly, Haydée is a very rare name in France, but quite common in Albania and Epirus; it is as if you were to say, for example, chastity, modesty, innocence; it is a sort of baptismal name, as your Parisians say.
077.068 --Oh, how charming!" said Albert, "how I would like to see our Frenchwomen called Miss Kindness, Miss Silence, Miss Christian Charity! Say, if Mlle. Danglars, instead of being called Claire-Marie-Eugénie, as she is called, were called Mlle. Chastity-Pudeur-Innocence Danglars, pest, what an effect that would have on the publication of banns!
077.069 --Crazy! said the count, do not joke so loudly, Haydée might hear you.
077.070 --And she would be angry?
077.071 --No," said the Count, with his haughty air.
077.072 --Is she a good person? asked Albert.
077.073 --That is not kindness, it is duty: a slave does not let go of her master.
077.074 --Come on! Don't joke yourself. Are there still slaves?
077.075 --Surely, since Haydée is mine.
077.076 -- Indeed, you do nothing and have nothing like anyone else. Slave of M. le Comte de Monte-Cristo! that is a position in France. The way you stir up the gold, it's a position that must be worth a hundred thousand écus a year.
077.077 --A hundred thousand écus! The poor child has possessed more than that; she came into the world lying on treasures next to which those of the _Mille et une Nuits_ are very little.
077.078 -So she is really a princess?
077.079 -- You said so, and even one of the greatest in her country.
077.080 --I suspected as much. But how did a great princess become a slave?
077.081 --How did Dionysius the Tyrant become a schoolmaster? The chance of war, my dear viscount, the caprice of fortune.
077.082 --And his name is a secret?
077.083 --For everyone, yes; but not for you, my dear viscount, who are friends of mine, and who will keep your mouth shut, won't you, if you promise to keep quiet?
077.084 --Oh! word of honor!
077.085 --You know the story of the pasha of Janina?
077.086 --Ali-Tebelin? no doubt, since it was in his service that my father made his fortune.
077.087 --That's true, I had forgotten it.
077.088 --Well, what is Haydée to Ali-Tebelin?
077.089 --Simply her daughter.
077.090 --How! the daughter of Ali-Pasha?
077.091 --And of the beautiful Vasiliki.
077.092 --And she is your slave?
077.093 --Oh, my God, yes.
077.094 --How so?
077.095 --Lady! One day I was passing through the market of Constantinople, I bought her.
077.096 --It is splendid! With you, my dear count, one does not live, one dreams. Now, listen, it is very indiscreet what I am going to ask you there.
077.097 --Say always.
077.098 --But since you go out with her, since you take her to the Opera....
077.099 --After?
077.100 -- May I venture to ask you that?
077.101 --You may venture to ask me anything.
077.102 -- Well, my dear Count, introduce me to your princess.
077.103 --Willingly, but on two conditions.
077.104 -- I accept them in advance.
077.105 --The first is that you will never entrust this presentation to anyone.
077.106 --Very well (Morcerf extended his hand). I swear it.
077.107 --The second is that you will not tell him that your father served his.
077.108 -- I swear again.
077.109 -- Wonderful, Viscount, you will remember these two oaths, won't you?
077.110 --Oh!" said Albert.
077.111 -- Very well. I know you are a man of honor."
077.112 The Count struck the bell again; Ali appeared again.
077.113 "Tell Haydée," he said, "that I am going to take coffee at her house, and make her understand that I ask permission to introduce her to a friend of mine."
077.114 Ali bowed and went out.
077.115 "So it is agreed, no direct questions, dear Viscount. If you wish to know something, ask me, and I will ask her.
077.116 -It is agreed."
077.117 Ali reappeared for the third time and held up the door, to indicate to his master and Albert that they could pass.
077.118 "Let's go in," said Monte Cristo.
077.119 Albert ran a hand through his hair and curled his moustache, the Count took off his hat, put on his gloves and preceded Albert into the apartment which was guarded, like an advanced sentry, by Ali, and which was defended, like a post, by the three French maids commanded by Myrtho.
077.120 Haydée was waiting in the first room, which was the salon, with large eyes dilated with surprise; for it was the first time that another man than Monte Cristo had penetrated to her; she was seated on a sofa, in a corner, with her legs crossed under her, and had made herself, as it were, a nest, in the richest striped and embroidered silk fabrics of the Orient. Near her was the instrument whose sounds had denounced her; she was charming as she was.
077.121 When she saw Monte Cristo, she lifted herself up with that double smile of a girl and a lover which belonged only to her; Monte Cristo went to her and offered her his hand on which, as usual, she pressed her lips.
077.122 Albert had remained near the door, under the influence of this strange beauty which he was seeing for the first time, and of which one could not form any idea in France.
077.123 "Whom do you bring to me?" asked the young girl in Roman to Monte Cristo; "a brother, a friend, a mere acquaintance, or an enemy?
077.124 --A friend, said Monte Cristo in the same language.
077.125 --His name?
077.126 --Count Albert; he is the same one I rescued from the hands of the bandits in Rome.
077.127 --In what language do you want me to speak to him?"
077.128 Monte Cristo turned back to Albert:
077.129 "Do you know modern Greek?" he asked the young man.
077.130 --Alas!" said Albert, "not even ancient Greek, my dear Count, never have Homer and Plato had a poorer, and I would even dare to say a more disdainful pupil.
077.131 --Then," said Haydée, proving by the request she herself was making that she had just heard Monte Cristo's question and Albert's answer, "I will speak in French or in Italian, if my lord, however, wills me to speak."
077.132 Monte Cristo thought for a moment:
077.133 "You will speak in Italian," he said.
077.134 Then turning to Albert:
077.135 "It is unfortunate that you do not hear modern Greek or ancient Greek, both of which Haydée speaks admirably; the poor child will be forced to speak Italian to you, which will perhaps give you a false idea of her."
077.136 He made a sign to Haydee.
077.137 "Welcome, friend, who comes with my lord and master," said the girl in excellent Tuscan, with that sweet Roman accent which makes the language of Dante as sonorous as the language of Homer; "Ali! coffee and pipes!"
077.138 And Haydée beckoned Albert with her hand to approach, while Ali withdrew to carry out the orders of his young mistress.
077.139 Monte Cristo showed Albert two folders, and each one went to get his own to approach a sort of pedestal table, with a hookah in the center, and loaded with natural flowers, drawings, and music albums.
077.140 Ali returned, bringing coffee and shibboleths; as for Mr. Baptistin, this part of the apartment was forbidden to him.
077.141 Albert pushed away the pipe that the Nubian presented to him.
077.142 "Oh, take, take," said Monte Cristo; "Haydée is almost as civilized as a Parisian: Havana is disagreeable to her, because she does not like bad smells; but Oriental tobacco is a perfume, you know that."
077.143 Ali went out.
077.144 The cups of coffee were prepared; only a sugar bowl had been added for Albert. Monte Cristo and Haydée took the Arabian liquor in the Arabian way, that is, without sugar.
077.145 Haydée stretched out her hand and took the Japanese porcelain cup with the tips of her slender pink fingers, which she raised to her lips with the naive pleasure of a child who drinks or eats something he likes.
077.146 At the same time two women entered, carrying two other trays loaded with ice cream and sorbets, which they placed on two small tables intended for that purpose.
077.147 "My dear host, and you, signora," said Albert in Italian, "excuse my amazement. I am quite stunned, and that is natural enough; here I find the Orient, the true Orient, not unfortunately such as I have seen, but such as I have dreamed in the bosom of Paris; just now I heard omnibuses rolling and the tinkling of lemonade sellers' bells. O signora!... I don't know Greek, but your conversation, together with this fairy-tale environment, would make up an evening I would always remember.
077.148 --I speak Italian well enough to speak with you, sir," said Haydée quietly; "and I will do my best, if you love the East, to make it your own here.
077.149 --What can I talk about?" asked Albert quietly to Monte Cristo.
077.150 --But about anything you like: his country, his youth, his memories; then, if you like it better, about Rome, Naples or Florence.
077.151 --Oh!" said Albert, "it would not be worth while to have a Greek woman before you to talk to her about everything you would talk to a Parisian woman; let me talk to her about the Orient.
077.152 --Do, my dear Albert, that is the conversation that is most agreeable to him."
077.153 Albert turned back to Haydée.
077.154 "At what age did the signora leave Greece?" he asked.
077.155 --At five years of age," replied Haydée.
077.156 --And do you remember your homeland?" asked Albert.
077.157 -- When I close my eyes, I see again everything I have seen. There are two looks: the look of the body and the look of the soul. The gaze of the body can sometimes forget, but that of the soul always remembers.
077.158 --And what is the longest time you can remember?
077.159 --I was barely walking, my mother, who is called Vasiliki (Vasiliki means royal, the girl added, raising her head), my mother took me by the hand, and, both covered with a veil, after putting all the gold we possessed in the bottom of the purse, we went to ask for alms for the prisoners, saying:
077.160 "He who gives to the poor lends to the Lord."
077.161 [Proverb XIX]
077.162 "Then, when our purse was full, we returned to the palace, and, without saying anything to my father, we sent all this money that had been given to us, taking us for poor women, to the egoumenos* of the convent who distributed it among the prisoners.
077.163 [In Greek, priest, abbot (Editor's note.)]
077.164 --And at that time how old were you?
077.165 --Three years old, said Haydée.
077.166 --So, do you remember everything that has happened around you since you were three years old?
077.167 --Everything.
077.168 --Count, said Morcerf softly to Monte Cristo, you should allow the signora to tell us something of her story. You have forbidden me to speak to her of my father, but perhaps she will speak to me of him, and you have no idea how happy I should be to hear his name come out of so pretty a mouth."
077.169 Monte Cristo turned to Haydée, and with a sign of his eyebrow that indicated that he would pay the greatest attention to the recommendation he was about to make to her, he said to her in Greek:
077.170 [Greek: Word for word: "Of thy father the fate, but not the name of the traitor, nor the treachery, tell us."]
077.171 Haydee heaved a long sigh, and a dark cloud passed over her brow so pure.
077.172 "What do you say to him?" asked Morcerf, softly.
077.173 --I tell her again that you are a friend, and that she has no need to hide from you.
077.174 --So, said Albert, this old pilgrimage for the prisoners is your first memory; what is the other?
077.175 -The other? I see myself under the shade of the sycamores, near a lake whose trembling mirror I can still see through the foliage; against the oldest and bushiest one, my father was sitting on cushions, and I, a weak child, while my mother lay at his feet, was playing with his white beard that descended on his chest, and with the diamond-handled cangiar passed on his belt; Then, from time to time, an Albanian would come to him and say a few words to which I paid no attention, and to which he would answer with the same tone of voice: "Kill! " or: "Be merciful!"
077.176 -It is strange, said Albert, to hear such things come out of the mouth of a young girl, other than on a stage, and to say to oneself: This is not a fiction. And," asked Albert, "how, with such a poetic horizon, how, with this marvelous distance, do you find France?
077.177 -- I think it is a beautiful country, said Haydée, but I see France as it is, because I see it with the eyes of a woman, while it seems to me, on the contrary, that my country, which I have seen only with the eyes of a child, is always enveloped in a luminous or dark fog, depending on whether my eyes make it a sweet homeland or a place of bitter suffering.
077.178 --So young, signora," said Albert yielding in spite of himself to the power of banality, "how could you suffer?"
077.179 Haydée turned her eyes toward Monte Cristo, who, with an imperceptible sign, murmured:
077.180 "[Greek: Raconte].
077.181 --Nothing composes the depths of the soul like the first memories, and, except for the two I have just told you, all the memories of my youth are sad.
077.182 --Speak, speak, signora," said Albert, "I swear I am listening to you with inexpressible happiness."
077.183 Haydée smiled sadly.
077.184 "So you want me to go on to my other memories?" she said.
077.185 --I beg you, said Albert.
077.186 -- Well, I was four years old when, one evening, I was awakened by my mother. We were in the palace of Janina; she took me on the cushions where I was lying, and, opening my eyes, I saw hers filled with big tears.
077.187 "She took me away without saying a word.
077.188 "Seeing her cry, I was about to cry too.
077.189 "--Silence! child, she said.
077.190 "Often, in spite of my mother's consolations or threats, capricious like all children, I continued to cry; but, this time, there was such an intonation of terror in my poor mother's voice, that I was silent at once.
077.191 "She carried me away quickly.
077.192 "Then I saw that we were descending a wide staircase; before us, all my mother's wives, carrying chests, bags, ornaments, jewels, gold purses, were descending the same staircase or rather rushing down it.
077.193 "Behind the women came a guard of twenty men, armed with long rifles and pistols, and dressed in that costume which you know in France since Greece became a nation again.
077.194 "There was something sinister, believe me," added Haydee, shaking her head and turning pale at the mere memory, "in that long line of slaves and women half weighed down by sleep, or at least I pictured it that way, I, who perhaps believed the others to be asleep because I was badly awake.
077.195 "In the staircase ran gigantic shadows that the fir-tree torches made tremble in the vaults.
077.196 "--Let's hurry!" said a voice from the back of the gallery.
077.197 "This voice made everyone bend, as the wind passing over the plain makes a field of corn bend.
077.198 "It made me tremble.
077.199 "That voice was my father's.
077.200 "He walked last, dressed in his splendid clothes, holding in his hand his rifle that your emperor had given him; and, leaning on his favorite Selim, he pushed us before him like a shepherd made of a distraught flock.
077.201 "-My father," said Haydée, raising his head, "was an illustrious man whom Europe knew as Ali-Tebelin, pasha of Janina, and before whom Turkey trembled."
077.202 Albert, without knowing why, shuddered as he heard these words pronounced with an indefinable accent of height and dignity; it seemed to him that something dark and frightening radiated from the girl's eyes, when, like a pythoness evoking a spectre, she awakened the memory of that bloody figure which his terrible death made appear gigantic to the eyes of contemporary Europe.
077.203 "Soon," continued Haydée, "the march stopped; we were at the bottom of the staircase and at the edge of a lake. My mother pressed me against her bouncing chest, and I saw, two steps behind, my father casting anxious glances on all sides.
077.204 "In front of us were four marble steps, and at the bottom of the last step a boat was waving.
077.205 "From where we were we could see a black mass standing in the middle of a lake; it was the kiosk where we were going.
077.206 "This kiosk seemed to me to be at a considerable distance, perhaps because of the darkness.
077.207 "We got into the boat. I remember that the oars did not make any noise when they touched the water; I bent down to look at them: they were wrapped with the belts of our Palicares.
077.208 "Besides the rowers, there were only women in the boat, my father, my mother, Selim and me.
077.209 "The Palicares had remained at the edge of the lake, kneeling on the last step, and making themselves, in case they had been pursued, a rampart of the other three.
077.210 "Our boat went like the wind.
077.211 "-Why is the boat going so fast?" I asked my mother.
077.212 "-Hush, my child," she said, "it is because we are running away.
077.213 "I did not understand. Why was my father running away, he who was all-powerful, he before whom the others usually ran away, he who had taken as his motto:
077.214 _They hate me, therefore they fear me?_
077.215 "Indeed, it was an escape that my father made on the lake. He has since told me that the garrison of the castle of Janina, tired of a long service...."
077.216 Here Haydée stopped her expressive glance at Monte Cristo, whose eye did not leave her eyes any more. The girl continued thus slowly, like someone who invents or suppresses.
077.217 "You were saying, signora," resumed Albert, who was paying the greatest attention to this account, "that the garrison of Janina, tired of a long service.
077.218 --had made a treaty with the seraskier Kurchid, sent by the sultan to seize my father; it was then that my father had resolved to retire, after sending to the sultan a frank officer, in whom he had full confidence, to the asylum which he himself had long since prepared, and which he called _kataphygion_, that is to say, his refuge.
077.219 --And this officer," asked Albert, "do you remember his name, signora?"
077.220 Monte Cristo exchanged a glance with the young girl as quick as a flash of lightning, and which remained unnoticed by Morcerf.
077.221 "No," she said, "I do not remember it; but perhaps later I shall remember it, and say it."
077.222 Albert was about to pronounce his father's name, when Monte Cristo gently raised his finger in silence; the young man remembered his oath and remained silent.
077.223 "It was towards this kiosk that we were sailing.
077.224 "A first floor decorated with arabesques, bathing its terraces in water, and a second floor overlooking the lake, here was all that the palace offered that was visible to the eyes.
077.225 "But below the first floor, extending into the island, was a subterranean, a vast cavern to which my mother and I and our wives were led, and where lay, forming a single heap, sixty thousand purses and two hundred barrels; in these purses were twenty-five million in gold, and in the barrels thirty thousand pounds of gunpowder.
077.226 "Near these barrels stood Selim, that favorite of my father of whom I have spoken to you; he kept watch day and night, with a spear at the end of which shone a lighted wick in his hand; he had orders to blow up everything, kiosk, guards, pasha, women and gold, at the first sign of my father.
077.227 "I remember that our slaves, knowing this dreadful vicinity, spent the days and nights praying, crying, and moaning.
077.228 "As for me, I always see the young soldier with the pale complexion and the black eye; and when the angel of death descends to me, I am sure that I will recognize Selim.
077.229 "I could not say how long we remained like that: at that time I still did not know what time was; sometimes, but rarely, my father called my mother and me to the palace terrace; these were my hours of pleasure to me, who saw in the subterranean nothing but groaning shadows and the fiery spear of Selim. My father, seated in front of a large opening, fixed a dark glance on the depths of the horizon, questioning each black point which appeared on the lake, while my mother, half lying close to him, leaned her head on his shoulder, and that, I, played at his feet, admiring, with these astonishments of childhood which still grow the objects, the escarpments of Pindus, which rose on the horizon, the castles of Janina, emerging white and angular from the blue waters of the lake, the immense tufts of black greenery, attached like lichens to the rocks of the mountain, which from afar seemed like mosses, and which up close are gigantic firs and immense myrtles.
077.230 "One morning my father sent for us, and we found him quite calm, but paler than usual.
077.231 "-Please be patient, Vasiliki, today everything will be over; today the master's firman arrives, and my fate will be decided. If the pardon is complete, we will return to Janina triumphant; if the news is bad, we will flee tonight.
077.232 "--But if they don't let us flee? said my mother.
077.233 "--Oh, don't worry," replied Ali, smiling; "Selim and his lighted spear answer to me. They would like me to be dead, but not on condition that they die with me.
077.234 "My mother responded only with sighs to these consolations, which did not come from my father's heart.
077.235 "She prepared for him the ice water which he drank every moment, because, since his retreat to the kiosk, he had been burned by a burning fever; she perfumed his white beard and lit the chibouque, whose smoke he sometimes followed absent-mindedly with his eyes for hours on end as it vanished into the air.
077.236 "Suddenly he made a movement so sudden that I was seized with fear.
077.237 "Then, without looking away from the point that was fixing his attention, he asked for his spyglass.
077.238 "My mother passed it to him, whiter than the stucco against which she leaned.
077.239 "I saw my father's hand tremble.
077.240 "--One boat!... two!... three!... murmured my father; four!...
077.241 "And he rose, seizing his weapons, and pouring, I remember, powder into the basin of his pistols.
077.242 "--Vasiliki, he said to my mother with a visible flinch, here is the moment that will decide us, in half an hour we will know the answer of the sublime emperor, withdraw to the underground with Haydée.
077.243 "--I do not want to leave you," said Vasiliki; "if you die, my master, I want to die with you.
077.244 "-Go to Selim!" shouted my father.
077.245 "--Farewell, lord!" murmured my mother, obedient and bent in two as if by the approach of death.
077.246 "--Get Vasiliki," said my father to his Palicares.
077.247 "But I, who was forgotten, ran to him and stretched out my hands on his side; he saw me, and, bending towards me, he pressed my forehead with his lips.
077.248 "Oh, that kiss was the last, and it is still there on my forehead.
077.249 "As we descended, we could see through the trellises of the terrace the boats that were growing on the lake, and which, like black dots in the past, already seemed like birds skimming the surface of the waves.
077.250 "Meanwhile, in the kiosk, twenty Palicares, seated at my father's feet and hidden by the woodwork, spied with a bloody eye the arrival of these boats, and held ready their long rifles inlaid with mother-of-pearl and silver: cartridges in great numbers were strewn on the floor; my father looked at his watch and walked about anxiously.
077.251 "This is what struck me when I left my father after the last kiss I received from him.
077.252 "My mother and I went through the underground. Selim was still at his post; he smiled sadly at us. We went to find cushions on the other side of the cave, and came to sit by Selim: in great perils, devoted hearts seek each other out, and, as a child, I felt instinctively that a great misfortune was hanging over our heads."
077.253 Albert had often heard the story, not from his father, who never spoke of it, but from strangers, of the last moments of the Janina vizier; he had read various accounts of his death; but this story, brought to life in the person and voice of the girl, this lively accent and lamentable elegy, penetrated him at once with an inexpressible charm and horror.
077.254 As for Haydée, all in these terrible memories, she had ceased for a moment to speak; her forehead, like a flower that bends on a stormy day, had bowed on her hand, and her eyes, vaguely lost, seemed to see still on the horizon the verdant Pindus and the blue waters of the lake of Janina, a magic mirror that reflected the dark picture she was sketching.
077.255 Monte Cristo looked at her with an indefinable expression of interest and pity.
077.256 "Go on, my daughter," said the Count in the Roman language.
077.257 Haydée raised her forehead, as if the sonorous words Monte Cristo had just uttered had awakened her from a dream, and she continued:
077.258 "It was four o'clock in the evening; but although the day was pure and bright outside, we were immersed in the shadow of the underground.
077.259 "Only one light shone in the cave, like a star trembling in a dark sky: it was Selim's wick. My mother was a Christian, and she prayed.
077.260 "Selim repeated these consecrated words from time to time:
077.261 "-God is great!
077.262 "However, my mother still had some hope. On her way down, she thought she recognized the Frank who had been sent to Constantinople, and in whom my father had every confidence, for he knew that the soldiers of the French sultan are usually noble and generous. She advanced a few steps toward the staircase and listened.
077.263 "--They are approaching," she said; "provided they bring peace and life.
077.264 "--What do you fear, Vasiliki?" answered Selim in his voice, so sweet and so proud at the same time; "if they do not bring peace, we will give them death."
077.265 "And he rekindled the flame of his spear with a gesture that made him look like the Dionysus of ancient Crete.
077.266 "But I, who was so childish and naive, was afraid of this courage, which I found fierce and foolish, and I was afraid of this dreadful death in the air and in the flame.
077.267 "My mother had the same impressions, for I felt her shiver.
077.268 "-My God! My God, Mother!
077.269 "And at my voice the cries and prayers of the slaves increased.
077.270 "--Child," said Vasiliki to me, "God forbid that you should come to desire that death which you fear today!
077.271 "Then, quite low:
077.272 "--Selim, she said, what is the master's order?
077.273 "-If he sends me his dagger, it is because the Sultan refuses to receive it in grace, and I set fire to it; if he sends me his ring, it is because the Sultan forgives him, and I deliver the powder magazine.
077.274 "--Among you," said my mother, "when the master's order comes, if it is the dagger that he sends, instead of killing us both with that death which frightens us, we will hold out our throats to you and you will kill us with that dagger.
077.275 "--Yes, Vasiliki," Selim answered quietly.
077.276 "Suddenly we heard a great shout; we listened: they were cries of joy; the name of the Frank who had been sent to Constantinople was repeated by our Palicars; it was evident that he was bringing back the answer of the sublime emperor, and that the answer was favorable.
077.277 --And you do not remember this name?" said Morcerf, ready to help the narrator's memory.
077.278 Monte Cristo made a sign to him.
077.279 "I don't remember it," replied Haydée.
077.280 "The noise redoubled; closer footsteps sounded; the steps of the underground passage were being descended.
077.281 "Selim readied his spear.
077.282 "Soon a shadow appeared in the bluish twilight formed by the rays of daylight penetrating to the entrance of the underground.
077.283 "--Who are you?" shouted Selim. But, whoever you are, don't take another step.
077.284 "--Hail to the Sultan!" said the shadow. All grace is granted to the Vizier Ali; and not only is his life saved, but his fortune and possessions are returned to him.
077.285 "My mother gave a cry of joy and held me close to her heart.
077.286 "-Stop!" said Selim to her, seeing that she was already rushing out; you know that I need the ring.
077.287 "-That's right, said my mother, and she fell on her knees and lifted me up to heaven, as if, at the same time as she was praying to God for me, she still wanted to lift me up to him."
077.288 And, for the second time, Haydée stopped overcome by such emotion that the sweat ran down her pale forehead, and her strangled voice seemed unable to pass her arid throat.
077.289 Monte Cristo poured a little iced water into a glass, and presented it to her, saying with a gentleness in which a tinge of command pierced:
077.290 "Have courage, my daughter!"
077.291 Haydee wiped her eyes and forehead, and continued:
077.292 "Meanwhile, our eyes, accustomed to the darkness had recognized the envoy of the pasha: it was a friend.
077.293 "Selim had recognized him; but the brave young man knew only one thing: to obey!
077.294 "--In what name do you come?
077.295 "--I come in the name of our master, Ali-Tebelin.
077.296 "--If you come in the name of Ali, do you know what you must give me?
077.297 "--Yes," said the envoy, "and I bring you his ring.
077.298 "At the same time he raised his hand above his head; but he was too far away and it was not light enough for Selim to be able, from where we were, to distinguish and recognize the object he was presenting to him.
077.299 "--I don't see what you are holding," said Selim.
077.300 "--Come closer, said the messenger, or I will come closer.
077.301 "--Neither, replied the young soldier; lay down in the place where you are, and under this ray of light, the object that you show me, and withdraw until I have seen it.
077.302 "-So be it, said the messenger.
077.303 "And he withdrew after depositing the sign of recognition in the place indicated.
077.304 "And our hearts beat fast: for the object seemed to us to be indeed a ring. Only, was it my father's ring?
077.305 "Selim, still holding his burning wick in his hand, came to the opening, bowed radiantly under the ray of light and picked up the sign.
077.306 "--The ring of the master, he said, kissing it, it is good!
077.307 "And turning the wick over on the ground, he stepped on it and extinguished it.
077.308 "The messenger gave a shout of joy and clapped his hands. At this signal, four soldiers of the seraskier Kurchid came running, and Selim fell with five stab wounds. Each had given his own.
077.309 "And yet, drunk with their crime, though still pale with fear, they rushed into the underground, looking everywhere for fire, and rolling over the bags of gold.
077.310 "In the meantime my mother took me in her arms, and, nimble, leaping by sinuosities known only to us, she reached a hidden staircase of the kiosk in which a frightening tumult reigned.
077.311 "The lower rooms were entirely populated by the Chodoars of Kurchid, that is, by our enemies.
077.312 "Just as my mother was about to push open the little door, we heard the terrible and threatening voice of the pasha.
077.313 "My mother glued her eye to the cracks in the boards; an opening happened to be in front of mine, and I looked.
077.314 "--What do you want?" said my father to some people who were holding a paper with golden characters in their hands.
077.315 "--What we want," answered one of them, "is to communicate to you the will of His Highness. Do you see this firman?
077.316 "--I see it," said my father.
077.317 "--Well, read; he asks for your head.
077.318 "My father gave a burst of laughter more frightening than a threat would have been; he had not yet ceased, that two pistol shots had left his hands and killed two men.
077.319 "The Palicares, who were lying all around my father with their faces to the floor, then rose and fired; the room was filled with noise, flame and smoke.
077.320 "Immediately the fire began on the other side, and the bullets pierced the boards all around us.
077.321 "Oh! how beautiful, how great, the vizier Ali-Tebelin, my father, in the midst of the bullets, the scimitar in his fist, his face black with powder! How his enemies fled!
077.322 "--Selim! Sélim!" he shouted, "keeper of the fire, do your duty!
077.323 "--Selim is dead!" answered a voice that seemed to come from the depths of the kiosk, "and you, my lord Ali, are lost!
077.324 "At the same time a dull detonation was heard, and the floor shattered all around my father.
077.325 "The Chodoars fired through the floor. Three or four Palicars fell, hit from the bottom up by wounds that plowed through their bodies.
077.326 "My father roared, thrust his fingers through the bullet holes and tore off a whole board.
077.327 "But at the same time, through this opening, twenty shots burst out, and the flame, coming out as if from the crater of a volcano, reached the hangings, which it devoured.
077.328 "In the midst of all this awful tumult, in the midst of these terrible cries, two blasts more distinct than all others, two cries more heart-rending than all cries, chilled me with terror. These two explosions had mortally struck my father, and it was he who had uttered these two cries.
077.329 "However, he had remained standing, clinging to a window. My mother was shaking the door to go and die with him; but the door was locked on the inside.
077.330 "All around him the Palicars were writhing in the convulsions of agony; two or three, who were uninjured or slightly wounded, leaped out of the windows. At the same time, the whole floor cracked underneath. My father fell on one knee; at the same time twenty arms stretched out, armed with sabers, pistols, and daggers, twenty blows struck one man at a time, and my father disappeared in a whirlwind of fire, fanned by these roaring demons as if hell had opened up beneath his feet.
077.331 "I felt myself roll to the ground: it was my mother who had fainted."
077.332 Haydée dropped both her arms with a groan and looked at the Count as if to ask him if he was satisfied with her obedience.
077.333 The Count got up, came to her, took her hand and said remarkably:
077.334 "Rest, dear child, and take courage in the thought that there is a God who punishes traitors.
077.335 --This is a dreadful story, Count," said Albert, frightened by Haydée's pallor, "and I now reproach myself for having been so cruelly indiscreet.
077.336 --That is nothing," replied Monte Cristo.
077.337 Then placing his hand on the girl's head:
077.338 "Haydée," he continued, "is a brave woman; she has sometimes found relief in the recital of her sorrows.
077.339 -Because, my lord," said the girl sharply, "because my pains remind me of your kindnesses."
077.340 Albert looked at her curiously, for she had not yet told what he most desired to know, namely, how she had become the count's slave.
077.341 Haydée saw in both the Count's and Albert's eyes the same expressed desire.
077.342 She continued:
077.343 "When my mother regained her senses," she said, "we were in front of the seraglio.
077.344 "-Kill me, she said, but spare the honor of Ali's widow.
077.345 "--It is not to me that you must address yourself, said Kourchid.
077.346 "--To whom then?
077.347 "--To your new master.
077.348 "--What is he?
077.349 "--Here he is.
077.350 "And Kourchid showed us one of those who had contributed most to the death of my father," continued the girl with dark anger.
077.351 --Then, asked Albert, you became the property of this man?
077.352 -- No, replied Haydée; he did not dare to keep us, he sold us to slave traders who were going to Constantinople. We crossed Greece, and we arrived dying at the imperial gate, crowded with onlookers who were moving aside to let us pass, when all of a sudden my mother followed the direction of their gaze with her eyes, let out a cry, and fell down, showing me a head above that gate.
077.353 "Below this head were written these words:
077.354 "This is the head of Ali-Tebelin, pasha of Janina."
077.355 "I tried, weeping, to raise my mother: she was dead!
077.356 "I was taken to the bazaar; a rich Armenian bought me, had me educated, gave me teachers, and when I was thirteen sold me to Sultan Mahmud.
077.357 -- "Which," said Monte Cristo, "I bought back, as I told you, Albert, for that emerald like the one I put my hashish pellets in.
077.358 --Oh! you are good, you are great, my lord," said Haydée, kissing Monte Cristo's hand, "and I am very happy to belong to you!"
077.359 Albert had remained quite dazed by what he had just heard.
077.360 "Finish your cup of coffee," said the Count to him; "the story is over."
078.000 One writes to us from Janina.
078.001 Franz had come out of Noirtier's room so staggering and so lost, that Valentine herself had taken pity on him.
078.002 Villefort, who had spoken only a few words without following up, and who had fled to his study, received, two hours later, the following letter:
078.003 "After what has been revealed this morning, M. Noirtier de Villefort cannot suppose that an alliance is possible between his family and that of M. Franz d'Épinay. M. Franz d'Épinay is horrified to think that M. de Villefort, who seemed to be aware of the events related this morning, did not warn him of this thought."
078.004 Anyone who had seen the magistrate bent over under the blow at that moment would not have believed that he foresaw it; indeed, he would never have thought that his father would have pushed the frankness, or rather the rudeness, so far as to tell such a story. It is true that M. Noirtier, disdainful enough as he was of his son's opinion, had never bothered to clarify the fact in Villefort's eyes, and that the latter had always believed that General de Quesnel, or Baron d'Epinay, as he might be called, either by the name he had made for himself or by the name he had been given, had been killed by assassination and not loyally killed in a duel.
078.005 This harsh letter from a young man who had been so respectful until then was fatal to the pride of a man like Villefort.
078.006 No sooner was he in his study than his wife entered.
078.007 The exit of Franz, called by M. Noirtier, had so astonished everyone that Mme de Villefort's position, left alone with the notary and the witnesses, became more embarrassing from moment to moment. Then Mme de Villefort made up her mind and left, announcing that she was going to the news.
078.008 M. de Villefort contented himself with telling her that following an explanation between himself, M. Noirtier and M. d'Épinay, Valentine's marriage to Franz had broken off.
078.009 This was difficult to report to those who were waiting; so Mme de Villefort, on her way home, contented herself with saying that M. Noirtier, having had, at the beginning of the conference, a sort of stroke, the contract was naturally postponed for a few days.
078.010 This news, false as it was, came so strangely in the wake of two similar misfortunes that the listeners looked at each other in astonishment and withdrew without saying a word.
078.011 Meanwhile, Valentine, happy and frightened at the same time, after having embraced and thanked the weak old man, who had just broken thus in one blow a chain which she already regarded as indissoluble, had asked to retire to her house to recover and Noirtier had, with his eye, granted her the permission she had requested.
078.012 But, instead of going back to her house, Valentine, once out, took the corridor, and, going out by the small door, dashed into the garden. In the midst of all the events that had just piled up one upon the other, a dull terror had constantly compressed her heart. She expected from one moment to another to see Morrel appear pale and threatening like the laird of Ravenswood at the contract of Lucie de Lammermoor.
078.013 Indeed, it was time that she arrived at the gate. Maximilien, who had suspected what was going to happen when he saw Franz leave the cemetery with M. de Villefort, had followed him; then, after having seen him enter, had seen him leave again and return with Albert and Château-Renaud. For him, therefore, there was no longer any doubt. He had then thrown himself into his enclosure, ready for any event, and quite certain that at the first moment of freedom that she could seize, Valentine would run to him.
078.014 He had not been mistaken; his eye, stuck to the boards, saw indeed appear the girl, who, without taking any precaution of use, ran to the gate. At the first glance he cast upon her, Maximilian was reassured; at the first word she uttered he leapt with joy.
078.015 "Saved!" said Valentine.
078.016 --Saved!" repeated Morrel, unable to believe in such happiness: "but by whom saved?
078.017 --By my grandfather. Oh! love him well, Morrel."
078.018 Morrel swore to love the old man with all his soul, and this oath did not cost him anything to make, for at that moment he was not content to love him as a friend or as a father, he adored him as a god.
078.019 "But how did it happen?" asked Morrel; "what strange means did he employ?"
078.020 Valentine opened her mouth to tell everything; but she thought that there was at the bottom of it all a terrible secret which did not belong to her grandfather alone.
078.021 "Later," she said, "I will tell you all about it.
078.022 --But when?
078.023 --When I am your wife."
078.024 This was putting the conversation on a chapter that made it easy for Morrel to hear everything: so he even heard that he should be content with what he knew, and that it was enough for one day. However, he consented to withdraw only on the promise that he would see Valentine the next evening.
078.025 Valentine promised what Morrel wanted. Everything was changed in her eyes, and certainly it was less difficult for her to believe now that she would marry Maximilian, than to believe an hour before that she would not marry Franz.
078.026 Meanwhile, Mme de Villefort had gone up to Noirtier's house.
078.027 Noirtier looked at her with that dark and severe eye with which he was accustomed to receive her.
078.028 "Sir," she said to him, "I don't need to tell you that Valentine's marriage has broken down, since it is here that this break-down has taken place.
078.029 Noirtier remained impassive.
078.030 "But," continued Mme de Villefort, "what you don't know, sir, is that I have always been opposed to this marriage, which was made in spite of myself."
078.031 Noirtier looked at his daughter-in-law like a man waiting for an explanation.
078.032 "Now that this marriage, for which I knew your repugnance, is broken off, I have come to make a move towards you that neither M. de Villefort nor Valentine can make."
078.033 Noirtier's eyes asked what this step was.
078.034 "I have come to beg you, sir," continued Mme. de Villefort, "as the only one who has the right to do so, for I am the only one to whom nothing will come of it; I have come to beg you to restore, I will not say your good graces, she has always had them, but your fortune, to your granddaughter."
078.035 Noirtier's eyes remained uncertain for a moment: he was evidently looking for the motives for this step and could not find them.
078.036 "May I hope, sir," said Mme. de Villefort, "that your intentions were in harmony with the prayer I came to make to you?
078.037 --Yes," said Noirtier.
078.038 --In that case, sir," said Mme. de Villefort, "I retire both grateful and happy."
078.039 And saluting M. Noirtier, she withdrew.
078.040 Indeed, the very next day Noirtier sent for the notary: the first will was torn up, and a new one was made, in which he left all his fortune to Valentine, on condition that she should not be separated from him.
078.041 Some people then calculated throughout the world that Mlle de Villefort, heiress of the Marquis and the Marquise de Saint-Méran, and returned to the grace of her grandfather, would one day have almost three hundred thousand livres of income.
078.042 While this marriage was breaking up at the Villeforts', M. le Comte de Morcerf had received a visit from Monte Cristo, and, to show his eagerness to Danglars, he donned his great lieutenant general's uniform, which he had had decorated with all his crosses, and asked for his best horses. Thus adorned, he went to the rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin, and made himself known to Danglars, who was taking his end-of-month statement.
078.043 It was not the moment when, for some time, it was necessary to take the banker to find him in good mood.
078.044 Also, with the aspect of his old friend, Danglars took his majestic air and established himself squarely in his armchair.
078.045 Morcerf, so empesé usually, had borrowed on the contrary a laughing and affable air; consequently, more or less sure that his opening was going to receive a good reception, he did not make diplomacy, and arriving at the goal of a single blow:
078.046 "Baron," he said, "here I am. For a long time we have been circling around our words of old...."
078.047 Morcerf expected, at these words, to see the banker's face bloom, whose darkening he attributed to his silence; but, on the contrary, that face became, what was almost incredible, more impassive and colder still.
078.048 This is why Morcerf had stopped in the middle of his sentence.
078.049 "What words, Monsieur le Comte?" asked the banker, as if searching in vain in his mind for an explanation of what the general meant.
078.050 --Oh!" said the count, "you are a formalist, my dear sir, and you remind me that the ceremonial must be done according to all the rites. Very well! my faith. Forgive me, as I have only one son, and as this is the first time I have thought of marrying him, I am still in my apprenticeship: come, I will perform it."
078.051 And Morcerf, with a forced smile, rose, made a deep bow to Danglars, and said to him:
078.052 "Monsieur le baron, I have the honor of asking you for the hand of Mlle. Eugénie Danglars, your daughter, for my son the viscount Albert de Morcerf."
078.053 But Danglars, instead of welcoming these words with a favor that Morcerf might have expected from him, frowned, and, without inviting the count, who had remained standing, to sit down:
078.054 "Monsieur le Comte," he said, "before answering you, I shall need to think.
078.055 --Reflect!" said Morcerf, more and more astonished; "haven't you had time to reflect since eight years ago when we first discussed this marriage?
078.056 --Monsieur le comte," said Danglars, "every day things happen which make the reflections that one thought were done have to be redone.
078.057 --How is that?" asked Morcerf; "I don't understand you anymore, baron!
078.058 --I mean to say, sir, that for the last fortnight new circumstances....
078.059 --Permit, said Morcerf; is this or is this not a comedy that we are playing?
078.060 --How do you mean, a comedy?
078.061 --Yes, let us explain ourselves categorically.
078.062 --I don't ask for more.
078.063 --You have seen M. de Monte Cristo!
078.064 --I see him very often, said Danglars, shaking his ruffle, he is a friend of mine.
078.065 -- Well, one of the last times you saw him, you told him that I seemed forgetful, irresolute, about this marriage.
078.066 --That's true.
078.067 -- Well, here I am. I am neither forgetful nor irresolute, you see, since I have come to summon you to keep your promise."
078.068 Danglars did not answer.
078.069 "Have you so soon changed your mind," added Morcerf, "or have you only provoked my request to give yourself the pleasure of humiliating me?"
078.070 Danglars understood that, if he continued the conversation in the tone in which he had begun it, the thing might turn out badly for him.
078.071 "Monsieur le comte," he said, "you must be rightly surprised at my reserve; I understand that: also, believe well that I, first of all, am afflicted by it; believe well that it is commanded to me by imperious circumstances.
078.072 --These are empty words, my dear sir," said the Count, "and which the first comer might perhaps be content with; but the Count de Morcerf is not the first comer; and when a man like him comes to another man, reminds him of the word he has given, and that man fails to keep his word, he has the right to demand in place of it that he should at least be given a good reason.
078.073 Danglars was a coward, but he did not want to appear so: he was stung by the tone Morcerf had just taken.
078.074 "So it is not good reason that I lack," he replied.
078.075 --What do you mean?
078.076 -- That I have a good reason, but that it is difficult to give.
078.077 --You feel, however," said Morcerf, "that I cannot afford your reticence; and one thing, in any case, seems clear to me, that you refuse my alliance.
078.078 -- No, sir," said Danglars, "I am suspending my resolution, that is all.
078.079 --But you do not, however, presume, I suppose, to believe that I subscribe to your whims to the point of waiting quietly and humbly for the return of your good graces?
078.080 --Then, sir count, if you cannot wait, let us look upon our projects as unavailing."
078.081 The count bit his lips to the quick in order not to make the outburst that his superb and irritable character led him to make; however, understanding that in such a circumstance ridicule would be on his side, he had already begun to gain the door of the salon, when, changing his mind, he retraced his steps.
078.082 A cloud had just passed over his forehead, leaving there, instead of offended pride, the trace of a vague anxiety.
078.083 "Let us see," he said, "my dear Danglars, we have known each other for many years, and, therefore, we must have some consideration for each other. You owe me an explanation, and it is the least I know to what unfortunate event my son owes the loss of your good intentions towards him.
078.084 --That is not personal to the viscount, that is all I can tell you, sir," replied Danglars, who became impertinent again when he saw that Morcerf was softening.
078.085 --And to whom, then, is this personal?" asked Morcerf in an altered voice, whose forehead grew pale.
078.086 Danglars, to whom none of these symptoms escaped, fixed on him a look more assured than he was accustomed to do.
078.087 "Thank me for not explaining myself further," he said.
078.088 A nervous tremor, which doubtless came from a contained anger, agitated Morcerf.
078.089 "I have the right," he replied, making a violent effort on himself, "I have the project of demanding that you explain yourself; is it then against Mme. de Morcerf that you have something? Is it my fortune that is not sufficient? Is it my opinions which, being contrary to yours ....
078.090 - "None of this, sir," said Danglars; "I would be unforgivable, for I have committed myself knowing all this. No, don't look any further, I am really ashamed to make you do this examination of conscience; let us leave it at that, believe me. Let's take the middle term of the delay, which is neither a break nor a commitment. There is no hurry, my God! My daughter is seventeen, and your son twenty-one. During our halt, time will go on; it will bring events; things which seem obscure the day before are sometimes too clear the day after; sometimes thus, in one day, the most cruel calumnies fall.
078.091 --Slander, did you say, sir?" cried Morcerf, becoming livid. I am being slandered!
078.092 --Monsieur le comte, let us not explain ourselves, I tell you.
078.093 --And so, sir, I will have to suffer this refusal quietly?
078.094 --Painful especially for me, sir. Yes, more painful for me than for you, for I was counting on the honor of your alliance, and a failed marriage always does more harm to the fiancée than to the fiancé.
078.095 - "That's all right, sir, let's not talk about it anymore," said Morcerf.
078.096 And crumpling up his gloves with rage, he left the apartment.
078.097 Danglars noticed that not once had Morcerf dared to ask if it was because of him, Morcerf, that Danglars was withdrawing his word.
078.098 In the evening he had a long conference with several friends, and M. Cavalcanti, who had been constantly in the ladies' room, was the last to leave the banker's house.
078.099 The next day, on awakening, Danglars asked for the newspapers; they were brought to him at once: he discarded three or four and took _l'Impartial_.
078.100 It was the one of which Beauchamp was the editor-manager.
078.101 He quickly broke open the envelope, opened it with nervous haste, passed disdainfully over the _Premier Paris_, and, arriving at the miscellaneous facts, stopped with his wicked smile at an entry beginning with these words: They write to us from Janina.
078.102 "Well," he said after reading, "here is a little piece of news about Colonel Fernand which, in all probability, will dispense me from giving explanations to M. le Comte de Morcerf."
078.103 At the same moment, that is, as nine o'clock in the morning sounded, Albert de Morcerf, dressed in black, buttoned up methodically, his gait agitated and his speech brief, presented himself at the house on the Champs-Élysées.
078.104 "M. le Comte has just gone out about half an hour ago," said the concierge.
078.105 -Did he take Baptistin with him?
078.106 --No, Monsieur le Vicomte.
078.107 --Call Baptistin, I want to talk to him."
078.108 The concierge went to fetch the valet de chambre himself, and a moment later returned with him.
078.109 "My friend," said Albert, "I beg your pardon for my indiscretion, but I wanted to ask you yourself if your master had really gone out?
078.110 --Yes, sir," answered Baptistin.
078.111 --Even for me?
078.112 --I know how happy my master is to receive him, and I would be careful not to confuse him in any way.
078.113 --You are right, for I have a serious matter to discuss with him. Do you think he will be late in returning?
078.114 --No, because he ordered his lunch at ten o'clock.
078.115 --Well, I'm going to take a walk to the Champs-Élysées, at ten o'clock I'll be here; if the Count gets back before me, tell him I beg him to wait.
078.116 --I will not fail to do so, sir may be sure."
078.117 Albert left the cabriolet he had taken at the Count's door and went for a walk.
078.118 As he passed the allée des Veuves, he thought he recognized the Count's horses parked at the door of Gosset's shot; he approached and, having recognized the horses, recognized the coachman.
078.119 "Is M. le Comte at the shooting?" asked Morcerf.
078.120 --Yes, sir," replied the coachman.
078.121 Indeed, several regular shots had been heard since Morcerf had been in the vicinity of the shooting.
078.122 He entered.
078.123 In the little garden stood the boy.
078.124 "Pardon," he said, "but would monsieur le vicomte care to wait a moment?
078.125 -Why is that, Philip?" asked Albert, who, being a regular, was surprised by this obstacle that he did not understand.
078.126 --Because the person who is practicing at the moment is shooting alone, and never shoots in front of anyone.
078.127 --Not even in front of you, Philippe?
078.128 --You see, sir, I am at the door of my dressing room.
078.129 --And who loads his pistols?
078.130 --His servant.
078.131 --A Nubian?
078.132 --A Negro.
078.133 --That's right.
078.134 --So you know this lord?
078.135 -- I have come to look for him; he is my friend.
078.136 --Oh, well, that's something else. I will go in to warn him."
078.137 And Philip, impelled by his own curiosity, entered the plank hut. A second later Monte Cristo appeared on the threshold.
078.138 "Pardon me for pursuing you so far, my dear count," said Albert; "but I begin by telling you that it is not the fault of your people, and that I alone am indiscreet. I came to your house and was told that you were out for a walk, but that you would return at ten o'clock for lunch. I took a walk in my turn while waiting for ten o'clock, and, while walking, I saw your horses and your carriage.
078.139 --What you are telling me now gives me the hope that you are coming to ask me to lunch.
078.140 --No, thank you, it is not a question of lunch at this hour; perhaps we shall have lunch later, but in bad company, for God's sake!
078.141 --What on earth are you talking about?
078.142 --My dear, I am fighting today.
078.143 --You? And for what?
078.144 --To fight, by God!
078.145 --Yes, I hear you, but for what? We fight for all sorts of things, you understand.
078.146 --For the sake of honor.
078.147 --Ah, this is serious.
078.148 --So serious, that I have come to ask you to do me a favor.
078.149 -What?
078.150 --To be my witness.
078.151 --Then it becomes serious; let's not talk about anything here, and let's go home. Ali, give me some water."
078.152 The Count rolled up his sleeves and passed into the little vestibule which precedes the shooting, and where the shooters are accustomed to wash their hands.
078.153 "Come in, then, Monsieur le Vicomte," said Philippe softly, "you will see something funny."
078.154 Morcerf entered. Instead of flies, playing cards were stuck to the plate.
078.155 From a distance, Morcerf thought it was the complete set; there were from the ace to the ten.
078.156 "Ah! ah!" said Albert, "were you playing piquet?
078.157 --No," said the Count, "I was playing cards.
078.158 --How so?
078.159 --Yes, those are aces and twos you see; only my balls made threes, fives, sevens, eights, nines and tens."
078.160 Albert approached.
078.161 Indeed, the bullets had, with perfectly exact lines and perfectly equal distances, replaced the missing signs and punctured the cardboard where it should have been painted. On his way to the plate, Morcerf picked up, in addition, two or three swallows which had had the imprudence to pass within range of the Count's pistol, and which the Count had shot.
078.162 "Devil!" said Morcerf.
078.163 --What do you want, my dear viscount," said Monte Cristo, wiping his hands with some linen brought by Ali, "I must occupy my idle moments, but come, I am waiting for you."
078.164 Both climbed into Monte Cristo's coupe, which, after a few moments, had deposited them at the door of No. 30.
078.165 Monte Cristo led Morcerf into his study, and showed him a seat. They both sat down.
078.166 "Now, let us talk quietly," said the Count.
078.167 --You see that I am perfectly calm.
078.168 --With whom do you want to fight?
078.169 --With Beauchamp.
078.170 --A friend of yours!
078.171 --It is always with friends that one fights.
078.172 --At least you need a reason.
078.173 --I have one.
078.174 --What did he do to you?
078.175 --There is, in a newspaper from last night... but here, read.
078.176 Albert handed Monte Cristo a newspaper in which he read these words:
078.177 "They write to us from Janina:
078.178 "A fact hitherto unknown, or at least unpublished, has come to our knowledge; the castles which defended the city have been surrendered to the Turks by a French officer in whom the vizier Ali-Tebelin had put all his confidence, and whose name was Fernand."
078.179 "Well," asked Monte Cristo, "what do you see in this that shocks you?
078.180 --How can I see that?
078.181 --Yes. What does it matter to you that the castles of Janina were delivered by an officer named Fernand?
078.182 --It matters to me that my father, the Count de Morcerf, was named Fernand by his Christian name.
078.183 --And your father served Ali-Pacha?
078.184 --That is to say, he fought for the independence of the Greeks; that is where the calumny lies.
078.185 --Ah, my dear viscount, let's talk reason.
078.186 -- I don't ask for more.
078.187 --Tell me a little: who the hell knows in France that the officer Fernand is the same man as the Count de Morcerf and who is occupying himself at this hour with Janina, who was taken in 1822 or 1823, I believe?
078.188 --That is precisely where the perfidy lies: one has let time pass on this, and then today one returns to forgotten events in order to bring out a scandal which can tarnish a high position. Well, I, heir to my father's name, do not want even a shadow of doubt to float over this name. I will send Beauchamp, whose newspaper published this note, two witnesses, and he will retract it.
078.189 --Beauchamp will not retract anything.
078.190 --Then we will fight.
078.191 --No, you will not fight, because he will answer that there were perhaps fifty officers in the Greek army named Fernand.
078.192 --We will fight in spite of this answer. Oh! I want this to go away.... My father, such a noble soldier, such an illustrious career....
078.193 --Or he will put: We are justified in believing that this Fernand has nothing in common with M. le Comte de Morcerf, whose baptismal name is also Fernand.
078.194 --I need a full and complete retraction; I will not be satisfied with this one!
078.195 --And you are going to send him your witnesses?
078.196 --Yes.
078.197 --You are wrong.
078.198 --That means you are refusing me the service I came to ask you for.
078.199 --Ah! you know my theory about the duel; I made my profession of faith to you in Rome, do you remember it?
078.200 --However, my dear Count, I found you this morning, just now, engaged in an occupation not very much in harmony with that theory.
078.201 --Because, my dear friend, you understand, one must never be exclusive. When one lives with fools, one must also learn to be a fool, from one moment to the next some burnt-out brain, which will have no more reason to quarrel with me than you have to quarrel with Beauchamp, will come to me for the first nonsense that comes along, or will send its witnesses to me, or will insult me in a public place: well, this burnt-out brain, I will have to kill it.
078.202 -- So you admit that you yourself would fight?
078.203 --Goddamn it!
078.204 --Well, then, why do you want me not to fight?
078.205 --I'm not saying that you shouldn't fight; I'm only saying that a duel is a serious thing and that you should think about it.
078.206 -Did he think about insulting my father?
078.207 -If he has not thought it over, let him admit it to you; you must not blame him.
078.208 --Oh, my dear Count, you are far too indulgent!
078.209 --And you, much too strict. Let's see, I suppose... listen carefully to this: I suppose .... Don't get angry at what I say!
078.210 --I am listening.
078.211 --I suppose that the fact reported is true....
078.212 --A son should not admit such an assumption about his father's honor.
078.213 --My God! We live in an age where so many things are admitted!
078.214 --That is precisely the vice of the age.
078.215 --Do you presume to reform it?
078.216 --Yes, in regard to what concerns me.
078.217 --My God! what a rigorist you are, my dear friend!
078.218 --I am so.
078.219 --Are you inaccessible to good advice?
078.220 --No, when it comes from a friend.
078.221 --Do you believe me to be yours?
078.222 --Yes.
078.223 --Well, before you send your witnesses to Beauchamp, find out.
078.224 --From whom?
078.225 --With Haydée, for example.
078.226 --What can a woman have to do with all this?
078.227 --To declare to you that your father had nothing to do with the defeat or death of his father, for example, or to enlighten you on this subject, if by chance your father had had the misfortune....
078.228 --I have already told you, my dear Count, that I cannot admit such a supposition.
078.229 --So you refuse to accept it?
078.230 --I refuse it.
078.231 --Absolutely?
078.232 --Absolutely!
078.233 --Then, one last piece of advice.
078.234 --So be it, but the last.
078.235 --Do you not want it?
078.236 --On the contrary, I ask you.
078.237 --Do not send witnesses to Beauchamp.
078.238 --How?
078.239 --Go and find him yourself.
078.240 --That is against all custom.
078.241 --Your case is out of the ordinary.
078.242 --And why do I have to go myself, let's see?
078.243 --Because that way the matter stays between you and Beauchamp.
078.244 --Explain yourself.
078.245 --Without a doubt; if Beauchamp is willing to withdraw, he must be given the credit of good will: the withdrawal will not be any less made. If he refuses, on the contrary, it will be time to put two strangers in your secret.
078.246 --They will not be two strangers, they will be two friends.
078.247 --Today's friends are tomorrow's enemies.
078.248 --Oh! for example!
078.249 --Witness Beauchamp.
078.250 --So....
078.251 --So, I recommend caution.
078.252 --So, you think I should go find Beauchamp myself?
078.253 --Yes.
078.254 --Alone?
078.255 --Alone. When you want to get something from a man's self-esteem, you have to save that man's self-esteem even the appearance of suffering.
078.256 -- I think you are right.
078.257 --Ah, how fortunate!
078.258 --I will go alone.
078.259 --Come on; but you had better not go at all.
078.260 --That's impossible.
078.261 --Do it this way; it will always be better than what you wanted to do.
078.262 --But in this case, let's see, if in spite of all my precautions, all my procedures, if I have a duel, will you serve as my witness?
078.263 -My dear viscount, said Monte Cristo with supreme gravity, you must have seen that in time and place I was all for you; but the service you will ask of me there is beyond the circle of those I can render you.
078.264 --Why is that?
078.265 --Perhaps you will know one day.
078.266 --But until then?
078.267 --I ask your indulgence for my secret.
078.268 --That's fine. I will take Franz and Château-Renaud.
078.269 -Take Franz and Château-Renaud, it will be wonderful.
078.270 --But, finally, if I fight, will you give me a little lesson in swords or pistols?
078.271 --No, that is still an impossible thing.
078.272 --Singular man that you are! So you don't want to interfere in anything?
078.273 --Absolutely nothing.
078.274 --So let's not talk about it anymore. Farewell, Count.
078.275 --Farewell, Viscount."
078.276 Morcerf took his hat and went out.
078.277 At the door he found his cabriolet, and, containing his anger as best he could, he made himself drive to Beauchamp's; Beauchamp was at his newspaper.
078.278 Albert had himself driven to the newspaper.
078.279 Beauchamp was in a dark, powdery office, as newspaper offices are founded.
078.280 Albert de Morcerf was announced to him. He had the announcement repeated twice; then, still not convinced, he shouted:
078.281 "Enter!"
078.282 Albert appeared. Beauchamp uttered an exclamation as he saw his friend pass the bundles of paper and tread with an ill-trained foot the newspapers of all sizes which littered not the parquet floor, but the reddened tile of his office.
078.283 "This way, this way, my dear Albert," he said, holding out his hand to the young man; "who on earth has brought you here? Are you lost like Tom Thumb, or have you simply come to ask me for lunch? Try to find a chair; here, over there, near this geranium which, alone here, reminds me that there are leaves in the world which are not sheets of paper.
078.284 --Beauchamp; said Albert, it is of your newspaper that I have come to speak to you.
078.285 --You, Morcerf? what do you want?
078.286 --I desire a correction.
078.287 --You, a rectification? About what, Albert? Sit down!
078.288 --Thank you, answered Albert for the second time, and with a slight nod.
078.289 --Explain yourself.
078.290 --A rectification of a fact that impugns the honor of a member of my family.
078.291 --Come on! said Beauchamp, surprised. What fact? That cannot be.
078.292 --The fact that someone wrote to you from Janina.
078.293 --From Janina?
078.294 --Yes, from Janina. In truth you seem to be unaware of what brings me here?
078.295 --On my honor... Baptiste! a newspaper from yesterday!" cried Beauchamp.
078.296 --It is useless, I am bringing you mine."
078.297 Beauchamp read, stammering:
078.298 "We have been written to from Janina, etc."
078.299 "You understand that the fact is serious," said Morcerf, when Beauchamp had finished.
078.300 --This officer is therefore your relative?" asked the journalist.
078.301 --Yes, said Albert, blushing.
078.302 --Well, what do you want me to do to please you?
078.303 --I would like, my dear Beauchamp, that you retract this fact."
078.304 Beauchamp looked at Albert with an attention that certainly announced much benevolence.
078.305 "Let's see," he said, "this is going to lead us into a long talk; for it is always a serious thing to recant. Sit down; I will read these three or four lines again."
078.306 Albert sat down, and Beauchamp reread the lines incriminated by his friend with more attention than the first time.
078.307 "Well, you see," said Albert firmly, rudely even, "someone in your paper has insulted one of my family, and I want a retraction.
078.308 --You... want....
078.309 --Yes, I do!
078.310 --Permit me to tell you that you are not a parliamentarian, my dear viscount.
078.311 --I don't want to be," replied the young man, rising to his feet; "I am pursuing the retraction of a fact which you stated yesterday, and I shall obtain it. You are my friend enough," continued Albert, with tight lips, seeing that Beauchamp, on his side, was beginning to raise his disdainful head; "you are my friend enough, and as such you know me enough, I hope, to understand my tenacity in such circumstances.
078.312 -If I am your friend, Morcerf, you will end up making me forget it with words like those of a moment ago .... But let's not get angry, or at least not yet.... You are worried, irritated, stung.... Let's see, who is this relative called Fernand?
078.313 -It is my father, quite simply, said Albert; M. Fernand Mondego, Count de Morcerf, an old soldier who has seen twenty battlefields, and whose noble scars one would like to cover with the impure mire collected in the stream.
078.314 -Is this your father? said Beauchamp: then it is something else; I understand your indignation, my dear Albert... Let us read again...."
078.315 And he read the note again, this time weighing up every word.
078.316 "But where do you see," asked Beauchamp, "that the Fernand of the newspaper is your father?
078.317 --Nowhere, I know it well; but others will see it. That is why I want the fact to be denied."
078.318 At the words _I want_, Beauchamp raised his eyes to Morcerf, and lowering them almost immediately, remained for a moment thoughtful.
078.319 "You will deny this, won't you, Beauchamp?" repeated Morcerf with increasing, though still concentrated, anger.
078.320 --Yes, said Beauchamp.
078.321 -- That's a good thing! said Albert.
078.322 --But when I am sure that the fact is false.
078.323 --How!
078.324 --Yes, the thing is worth clearing up, and I will clear it up.
078.325 --But what do you see in all this to clear up, sir? said Albert, out of all proportion. If you do not believe that it is my father, say so at once; if you believe that it is him, give me reason for that opinion."
078.326 Beauchamp looked at Albert with that smile which was peculiar to him, and which knew how to take the shade of all passions.
078.327 "Sir," he resumed, "since there is a gentleman, if it is to ask me for a reason that you have come, you should have done so first and not come to speak to me of friendship and other idle things like those I have had the patience to hear for half an hour. Is this the ground on which we are going to walk from now on, let's see!
078.328 --Yes, if you do not retract the infamous slander!
078.329 -- One moment! No threats, please, Monsieur Albert Mondego, Viscount de Morcerf, I don't suffer them from my enemies, let alone from my friends. So you want me to deny the fact about Colonel Fernand, a fact in which I have, on my honor, taken no part?
078.330 --Yes, I do! said Albert, whose head was beginning to wander.
078.331 --Without which we will fight? continued Beauchamp with the same calm.
078.332 --Yes!" said Albert, raising his voice.
078.333 -- Well, said Beauchamp, here is my answer, my dear sir: this fact was not inserted by me, I did not know it; but you have, by your approach, drawn my attention to it, it clings to it; it will therefore remain until it is denied or confirmed by whom it may concern.
078.334 --Sir," said Albert, rising to his feet, "I will have the honor of sending you my witnesses; you will discuss with them the place and the weapons.
078.335 --Perfectly, my dear sir.
078.336 --And tonight, please, or tomorrow at the latest, we will meet.
078.337 --No! No! I will be in the field when it is necessary, and, in my opinion (I have the right to give it, since it is I who receive the provocation), and, in my opinion, I say, the time has not yet come. I know that you draw a sword very well, I draw it fairly well; I know that you make three flies out of six, that's my strength about; I know that a duel between us will be a serious one, because you are brave and that... I am too. So I don't want to expose myself to killing you or being killed by you without a cause. It is I who will ask the question and ca-té-go-ri-que-ment.
078.338 "Are you so intent on this recantation that you will kill me if I do not, even though I have told you, even though I repeat to you, even though I affirm on my honor that I did not know the fact; even though I declare to you, finally, that it is impossible for anyone other than a Don Japhet like you to guess M. le Comte de Morcerf under the name of Fernand?
078.339 --I am absolutely sure of it.
078.340 -- Well, my dear sir, I agree to cut my throat with you, but I want three weeks; in three weeks you will find me to tell you: Yes, the fact is false, I will erase it; or else: Yes, the fact is true, and I will take the swords out of the scabbard, or the pistols out of the box, as you choose.
078.341 --Three weeks!" cried Albert; "but three weeks is three centuries during which I am dishonored!
078.342 --If you had remained my friend, I would have said to you: Patience, friend; you have made an enemy of me, and I say to you: What do I care, sir?
078.343 -- Well, in three weeks, so be it, said Morcerf. But think of it, in three weeks there will be no more delay or subterfuge that can exempt you....
078.344 --Monsieur Albert de Morcerf, said Beauchamp, rising in his turn, I can only throw you out of the window in three weeks, that is to say, in twenty-four days, and you, you have the right to attack me only at that time. This is the 29th of August, so the 21st of September. Until then, believe me, and this is a gentleman's advice I give you, let us spare ourselves the barking of two doggos chained at a distance."
078.345 And Beauchamp, bowing gravely to the young man, turned his back on him and passed into his print shop.
078.346 Albert took his revenge on a pile of newspapers, which he scattered with great blows of his dagger, after which he left, not without having turned around two or three times toward the door of the printing shop.
078.347 While Albert was whipping the front of his cabriolet after having whipped the innocent blackened papers that could not but be discomfited by his disappointment, he saw Morrel crossing the boulevard, who, with his nose to the wind, his eye alert and his arms free, was passing in front of the Chinese baths, coming from the Porte Saint-Martin side, and going to the Madeleine side.
078.348 "Ah!" he said, sighing, "here is a happy man!"
078.349 By chance, Albert was not mistaken.
079.000 The lemonade.
079.001 Indeed, Morrel was very happy.
079.002 M. Noirtier had just sent for him, and he was so anxious to know why, that he had not taken a cabriolet, trusting much more to his two legs than to the legs of a horse; he had thus left the Rue Meslay and was going to the Faubourg Saint-Honoré.
079.003 Morrel walked at a gymnastic pace, and poor Barrois followed him as best he could. Morrel was thirty-one years old, Barrois was sixty; Morrel was drunk with love, Barrois was impaired by the great heat. These two men, thus divided of interests and age, resembled the two lines which form a triangle: separated by the base, they join at the top.
079.004 The top, it was Noirtier, who had sent to seek Morrel by recommending to him to make diligence, recommendation which Morrel followed to the letter, with the great despair of Barrois.
079.005 By arriving, Morrel was not even out of breath: love gives wings, but Barrois, who for a long time had not been in love, Barrois was in swimming.
079.006 The old servant made Morrel enter by the particular door, closed the door of the cabinet, and soon a rustling of dress on the parquet announced the visit of Valentine.
079.007 Valentine was beautiful to charm under his clothes of mourning.
079.008 The dream became so soft that Morrel would almost have done without conversing with Noirtier; but the old man's armchair soon rolled on the parquet, and he entered.
079.009 Noirtier received with a benevolent glance the thanks that Morrel lavished on him for this marvelous intervention which had saved them, Valentine and him, from despair. Then the glance of Morrel went to provoke, on the new favor which was granted to him, the girl, who, timid and sat far from Morrel, waited to be forced to speak.
079.010 Noirtier looked at her in turn.
079.011 "So I must say what you have charged me with?" she asked.
079.012 --Yes," said Noirtier.
079.013 --Monsieur Morrel, said Valentine to the young man who was devouring her with his eyes, my good father Noirtier had a thousand things to say to you, which for three days he has been telling me. Today, he sends for you so that I repeat them to you; I will thus repeat them to you, since he chose me for his interpreter, without changing a word of his intentions.
079.014 --Oh! I am listening very impatiently," replied the young man; "speak, miss, speak."
079.015 Valentine lowered his eyes: it was an omen which seemed sweet to Morrel. Valentine was weak only in happiness.
079.016 "My father wants to leave this house," she said. Barrois is looking for a suitable apartment for him.
079.017 --But you, mademoiselle," said Morrel, "you who are so dear and so necessary to M. Noirtier?
079.018 - I," said the young girl, "will not leave my grandfather; it is agreed between him and me. My apartment will be near his. I will either have the consent of M. de Villefort to go and live with good Papa Noirtier, or I will be refused: in the first case, I will leave at once; in the second, I will wait for my majority, which comes in eighteen months. Then I will be free, I will have an independent fortune, and ....
079.019 --And?" asked Morrel.
079.020 --And, with good father's permission, I will keep the promise I made you."
079.021 Valentine pronounced these last words so low, that Morrel could not have heard them without the interest he had in devouring them.
079.022 "Is it not your thought that I expressed there, good father?" added Valentine, addressing Noirtier.
079.023 --Yes," said the old man.
079.024 -Once at my grandfather's, Valentine added, M. Morrel will be able to come and see me in the presence of this good and worthy protector. If this bond which our hearts, perhaps ignorant or capricious, had begun to form seems suitable and offers guarantees of future happiness to our experience (alas! it is said, hearts inflamed by obstacles cool down in security!) then M. Morrel will be able to ask me myself, I will wait for him.
079.025 --Oh!" cried Morrel, tempted to kneel before the old man as before God, before Valentine as before an angel; "oh, what good have I done in my life to deserve such happiness?
079.026 -- Until then," continued the young girl in her pure and severe voice, "we respect propriety, the very will of our parents, provided that this will does not tend to separate us forever; in a word, and I repeat this word because it says it all, we will wait.
079.027 --And the sacrifices that this word imposes, sir," said Morrel, "I swear to you to accomplish them, not with resignation, but with happiness.
079.028 --And so, continued Valentine with a very gentle look at Maximilian's heart, no more imprudence, my friend, do not compromise her who, from this day forward, considers herself destined to bear your name purely and worthily."
079.029 Morrel pressed his hand to his heart.
079.030 However Noirtier looked at them both with tenderness. Barrois, who had remained in the background like a man to whom one has nothing to hide, smiled while wiping the large drops of water which fell from his bald forehead.
079.031 "Oh, my God, how hot he is, this good Barrois," said Valentine.
079.032 --Ah! said Barrois, it is that I ran well, come on, miss; but M. Morrel, I must do him that justice, ran even faster than I did."
079.033 Noirtier indicated with his eye a tray on which were served a carafe of lemonade and a glass. What was missing from the carafe had been drunk half an hour before by Noirtier.
079.034 "Here, good Barrois," said the young girl, "take, for I see that you are looking at this half-finished carafe with your eyes.
079.035 --The fact is, says Barrois, that I am dying of thirst, and that I will gladly drink a glass of lemonade to your health.
079.036 --Go ahead, said Valentine, and come back in a moment."
079.037 Barrois took the tray away, and no sooner was he in the corridor, than through the door, which he had forgotten to close, he could be seen leaning his head back to empty the glass that Valentine had filled.
079.038 Valentine and Morrel were exchanging farewells in the presence of Noirtier, when the bell rang in Villefort's staircase.
079.039 It was the signal for a visit.
079.040 Valentine looked at the clock.
079.041 "It's noon," she said, "today is Saturday, good Papa, it's probably the doctor."
079.042 Noirtier nodded that indeed it must be him.
079.043 "He will come here, Mr. Morrel must go, mustn't he, good papa?
079.044 --Yes," replied the old man. Barrois!" called Valentine; "Barrois, come!
079.045 The voice of the old servant was heard answering:
079.046 "I'm going, mademoiselle.
079.047 --Barrois is going to lead you to the door," said Valentine to Morrel; "and now remember one thing, Monsieur l'officier, that my good father recommends that you do not risk any step capable of compromising our happiness.
079.048 --I promised to wait, said Morrel, and I will wait."
079.049 At this moment, Barrois entered.
079.050 "Who rang?" asked Valentine.
079.051 --Monsieur le docteur d'Avrigny, said Barrois, staggering on his legs.
079.052 --Well, what is it, Barrois?" asked Valentine.
079.053 The old man did not answer; he looked at his master with frightened eyes, while with his clenched hand he sought a support to remain standing.
079.054 "But he is going to fall!" cried Morrel.
079.055 Indeed, the trembling of which Barrois was seized increased by degrees; the features of the face, altered by the convulsive movements of the muscles of the face, announced a nervous attack of the most intense.
079.056 Noirtier, seeing Barrois thus disturbed, multiplied his glances in which were painted, intelligible and palpitating, all the emotions which agitate the heart of the man.
079.057 Barrois made some steps towards his master.
079.058 "Ah, my God! my God! Lord," he said, "what is the matter with me? I am suffering... I cannot see. A thousand fiery spikes go through my skull. Oh, do not touch me, do not touch me!
079.059 Indeed, the eyes became protruding and haggard, and the head tipped back, while the rest of the body stiffened.
079.060 Valentine cried out in horror; Morrel took her in his arms as if to defend her against some unknown danger.
079.061 "Monsieur d'Avrigny! Monsieur d'Avrigny!" cried Valentine in a choked voice, "Help us!
079.062 Barrois turned on himself, took three steps backward, stumbled, and came to fall at the feet of Noirtier, on whose knee he pressed his hand, shouting:
079.063 "My master! my good master!"
079.064 At this moment M. de Villefort, attracted by the cries, appeared on the threshold of the room.
079.065 Morrel dropped Valentine, half fainting, and throwing himself back, sank into the corner of the room and almost disappeared behind a curtain.
079.066 Pale as if he had seen a snake rise up before him, he fixed an icy gaze on the unfortunate dying man.
079.067 Noirtier boiled with impatience and terror; his soul flew to the aid of the poor old man, his friend rather than his servant. One could see the terrible struggle of life and death reflected on his forehead by the swelling of the veins and the contraction of a few muscles that remained alive around his eyes.
079.068 Barrois, his face agitated, his eyes bloodshot, his neck turned back, lay beating the floor with his hands, while his stiff legs seemed to have to break rather than bend.
079.069 A slight foam rose to his lips, and he gasped painfully.
079.070 Villefort, stunned, remained for a moment with his eyes fixed on this picture, which, as soon as he entered the room, attracted his attention.
079.071 He had not seen Morrel.
079.072 After a moment of silent contemplation during which one could see his face turn pale and his hair stand on end:
079.073 "Doctor! doctor!" he cried, rushing to the door, "come! come!
079.074 --Madam! madam!" cried Valentine, calling her mother-in-law as she bumped against the walls of the staircase, "come! come quickly and bring your bottle of salts!
079.075 --What is the matter?" asked the metallic and restrained voice of Mme. de Villefort.
079.076 --Oh! come! come!
079.077 --But where is the doctor!" cried Villefort; "where is he?
079.078 Mme. de Villefort descended slowly; one could hear the boards creak under her feet. In one hand she held the handkerchief with which she wiped her face, in the other a bottle of English salts.
079.079 Her first glance, on reaching the door, was at Noirtier, whose face, except for the natural emotion in such a circumstance, announced equal health; her second glance met the dying man.
079.080 She paled, and her eye rebounded, so to speak, from the servant to the master.
079.081 "But in the name of Heaven, madam, where is the doctor? It is an apoplexy, you see, with a bloodletting we will save him.
079.082 - Has he eaten recently?" asked Mme de Villefort, evading the question.
079.083 --Madame, said Valentine, he has not had breakfast, but he ran a lot this morning to do an errand that good father had charged him with. On the way back he only took a glass of lemonade.
079.084 --Ah!" said Mme de Villefort, "why not wine? It is very bad, lemonade.
079.085 --The lemonade was there under his hand, in good father's carafe; poor Barrois was thirsty, he drank what he found."
079.086 Mme. de Villefort shuddered. Noirtier enveloped her with his deep gaze.
079.087 "He has such a short neck!" she said.
079.088 --Madame, said Villefort, I ask you where M. d'Avrigny is; in the name of Heaven, answer!
079.089 --He is in Edward's room, who is a little ill," said Mme. de Villefort, who could not evade the question any longer.
079.090 Villefort rushed up the stairs to fetch him himself.
079.091 "Here," said the young woman, handing Valentine her bottle, "we're going to bleed him no doubt. I'm going back to my house, because I can't bear the sight of blood."
079.092 And she followed her husband.
079.093 Morrel came out of the dark corner where he had withdrawn, and where no one had seen him, so great was the concern.
079.094 "Go quickly, Maximilian," said Valentine, "and wait for me to call you. Go."
079.095 Morrel consulted Noirtier with a gesture. Noirtier, who had retained all his composure, nodded to him.
079.096 He clasped Valentine's hand to his heart and went out through the concealed corridor.
079.097 At the same time Villefort and the doctor returned through the opposite door.
079.098 Barrois was beginning to come to himself: the crisis had passed, his speech was coming back groaning, and he was rising on one knee.
079.099 D'Avrigny and Villefort carried Barrois to a chaise longue.
079.100 "What do you order, doctor?" asked Villefort.
079.101 -- Bring me water and ether. Do you have any in the house?
079.102 --Yes.
079.103 -- Let them run and get me some turpentine and emetic.
079.104 --Come on! says Villefort.
079.105 --And now let everyone retire.
079.106 --Me too? asked Valentine timidly.
079.107 --Yes, miss, you especially," said the doctor rudely.
079.108 Valentine looked at M. d'Avrigny with astonishment, kissed M. Noirtier on the forehead, and left.
079.109 Behind her the doctor closed the door with a somber look.
079.110 "Here, here, Doctor, here he comes back; it was only a minor attack.
079.111 M. d'Avrigny smiled grimly.
079.112 "How do you feel, Barrois?" asked the doctor.
079.113 --A little better, sir.
079.114 --Can you drink this glass of ethereal water?
079.115 --I'll try, but don't touch me.
079.116 --Why?
079.117 --Because it seems to me that if you touch me, even if only with the tip of your finger, the attack will take me back.
079.118 --Buvez."
079.119 Barrois took the glass, brought it to his purple lips, and emptied it about halfway.
079.120 "Where are you suffering?" asked the doctor.
079.121 -Everywhere; I have terrible cramps.
079.122 --Do you have glare?
079.123 --Yes.
079.124 --The ringing in my ears?
079.125 --Affraid.
079.126 --When did this happen to you?
079.127 --All at once.
079.128 --Rapidly?
079.129 --Like lightning.
079.130 --Nothing yesterday? Nothing the day before yesterday?
079.131 --Nothing.
079.132 --No drowsiness? no heaviness?
079.133 --No.
079.134 --What did you eat today?
079.135 --I have eaten nothing; I have drunk only a glass of monsieur's lemonade, that is all."
079.136 And Barrois nodded to Noirtier, who was motionless in his armchair, contemplating this terrible scene without losing a movement, without letting a word escape.
079.137 "Where is that lemonade?" asked the doctor sharply.
079.138 --In the carafe downstairs.
079.139 --Where, downstairs!
079.140 --In the kitchen.
079.141 --Do you want me to get it, doctor?
079.142 --No, stay here, and see that the patient drinks the rest of this glass of water.
079.143 --But this lemonade....
079.144 --I'll get it myself."
079.145 D'Avrigny made a leap, opened the door, dashed up the back stairs and nearly knocked down Madame de Villefort, who was also going down to the kitchen.
079.146 She let out a scream.
079.147 D'Avrigny did not even notice; carried away by the power of a single idea, he jumped the last three or four steps, rushed into the kitchen, and saw the three-quarters empty carafe on a tray.
079.148 He pounced on it like an eagle on its prey.
079.149 Panting, he went upstairs and into the room. Mme de Villefort was slowly going up the stairs that led to her house.
079.150 "Is this the carafe that was here?" asked d'Avrigny.
079.151 --Yes, Monsieur le Docteur.
079.152 --Is this the same lemonade that you drank?
079.153 --I think so.
079.154 --What taste did you find in it?
079.155 --Bitter taste."
079.156 The doctor poured a few drops of lemonade into the hollow of his hand, sucked it in with his lips, and, after rinsing his mouth of it as one does with wine one wants to taste, spat the liquor into the fireplace.
079.157 "It is the same," he said. And have you drunk it too, Monsieur Noirtier?
079.158 --Yes," said the old man.
079.159 --And you found it has the same bitter taste?
079.160 -- Yes.
079.161 --Ah! Mr. Doctor!" cried Barrois, "there it is again! My God, Lord, have mercy on me!"
079.162 The doctor ran to the patient.
079.163 "This emetic, Villefort, see if it comes.
079.164 Villefort rushed forward, shouting:
079.165 "The emetic! The emetic! Has it been brought?"
079.166 Nobody answered. The deepest terror reigned in the house.
079.167 "If I had a way to breathe air into his lungs," said d'Avrigny, looking around him, "perhaps there would be a way to prevent asphyxiation. But no, nothing, nothing!
079.168 --Oh, sir," cried Barrois, "will you let me die thus without help? Oh, I am dying, my God, I am dying!
079.169 --A feather! a feather!" asked the doctor.
079.170 He saw one on the table.
079.171 He tried to introduce the feather into the mouth of the patient, who was making useless efforts to vomit in the midst of his convulsions; but the jaws were so tight that the feather could not pass.
079.172 Barrois was suffering from a nervous attack even more intense than the first. He had slipped from the chaise longue to the floor, and was stiffening on the parquet.
079.173 The doctor left him in the grip of this attack, to which he could give no relief, and went to Noirtier.
079.174 "How do you feel?" he said hastily and in a low voice; "good?
079.175 --Yes.
079.176 --Light stomach or heavy? light?
079.177 --Yes.
079.178 --Same as when you took the pill I have them give you every Sunday?
079.179 --Yes.
079.180 --Is it Barrois who made your lemonade?
079.181 --Yes.
079.182 --Did you hire him to drink it?
079.183 --No.
079.184 --Is it M. de Villefort?
079.185 --No.
079.186 --Madame?
079.187 --No.
079.188 --Is it Valentine, then?
079.189 --Yes."
079.190 A sigh from Barrois, a yawn that made the bones of his jaw crack, called d'Avrigny's attention: he left M. Noirtier and ran close to the patient.
079.191 "Barrois," said the doctor, "can you speak?
079.192 Barrois stammered a few unintelligible words.
079.193 "Try to make an effort, my friend."
079.194 Barrois reopened bloodshot eyes.
079.195 "Who made the lemonade?
079.196 --Me.
079.197 -Did you bring it to your master as soon as you made it?
079.198 --No.
079.199 --Did you leave it somewhere, then?
079.200 -- At the office, I was called.
079.201 --Who brought it here?
079.202 --Miss Valentine."
079.203 D'Avrigny struck his forehead.
079.204 "O my God! my God!" he murmured.
079.205 --Doctor! Doctor!" cried Barrois, who felt a third attack coming on.
079.206 --But won't they bring that emetic, cried the doctor.
079.207 --Here's a glass all prepared, said Villefort as he came in.
079.208 --By whom?
079.209 --By the pharmacist's boy who came with me.
079.210 --Buvez.
079.211 --Impossible, doctor, it is too late; my throat is closing, I am choking! Oh! my heart! Oh! my head.... Oh! what a hell!... Am I going to suffer for a long time like this?
079.212 --No, no, my friend, says the doctor, soon you will not suffer anymore.
079.213 --Ah, I understand you!" cried the unhappy man; "my God! have pity on me!
079.214 And, throwing out a cry, he fell backwards, as if struck by lightning. D'Avrigny laid a hand on his heart, brought a mirror to his lips.
079.215 "Well?" asked Villefort.
079.216 -Go and tell the kitchen that they are bringing me some violet syrup very quickly.
079.217 Villefort went down at once.
079.218 "Don't be frightened, Monsieur Noirtier," said d'Avrigny, "I'm taking the patient to another room to bleed him; in truth, these kinds of attacks are an awful sight to see."
079.219 And taking Barrois by the underside of his arms, he dragged him into a neighboring room; but almost immediately he returned to Noirtier to take the rest of the lemonade.
079.220 Noirtier closed his right eye.
079.221 "Valentine, isn't it? You want Valentine? I'll tell them to send her to you."
079.222 Villefort went upstairs; d'Avrigny met him in the corridor.
079.223 "Well?" he asked.
079.224 --Come," said d'Avrigny.
079.225 And he took him into the room.
079.226 "Still fainting?" asked the King's Prosecutor.
079.227 --He's dead."
079.228 Villefort stepped back three steps, joined his hands above his head, and with unequivocal commiseration
079.229 "Dead so quickly!" he said, looking at the corpse.
079.230 --Yes, very quickly, isn't it?" said d'Avrigny; "but that shouldn't surprise you: M. and Mme. de Saint-Méran died just as quickly. Oh, one dies quickly in your house, Monsieur de Villefort.
079.231 --What!" exclaimed the magistrate with an accent of horror and consternation, "you are returning to that terrible idea!
079.232 --Always, sir, always!" said D'Avrigny solemnly, "for it has not left me for a moment, and so that you may be well convinced that I am not mistaken this time, listen carefully, Monsieur de Villefort."
079.233 Villefort trembled convulsively.
079.234 "There is a poison that kills almost without leaving a trace. I know this poison well: I have studied it in all the accidents it causes, in all the phenomena it produces. This poison, I recognized it just now in poor Barrois, as I had recognized it in Mme de Saint-Méran. This poison, there is a way to recognize its presence: it restores the blue color of the litmus paper reddened by an acid, and it dyes in green the syrup of violets. We have no litmus paper; but, lo, here comes the violet syrup I asked for."
079.235 Indeed, footsteps were heard in the corridor, the doctor opened the door, took from the maid's hands a vase at the bottom of which there were two or three spoonfuls of syrup, and closed the door.
079.236 "Look," he said to the king's prosecutor, whose heart was beating so loudly that it could have been heard, "here in this cup is some violet syrup, and in this decanter the rest of the lemonade of which M. Noirtier and Barrois drank some. If the lemonade is pure and harmless, the syrup will keep its color; if the lemonade is poisoned, the syrup will turn green. Look!"
079.237 The doctor slowly poured a few drops of lemonade from the carafe into the cup, and a cloud was seen to form at the bottom of the cup at that very moment, this cloud first took on a blue hue; then from sapphire it changed to opal and from opal to emerald.
079.238 Arrived at this last color, it fixed itself there, so to speak, the experiment left no doubt.
079.239 "The unfortunate Barrois was poisoned with false angusture and St. Ignatius' nut," said d'Avrigny; "now I will answer for it before men and before God."
079.240 Villefort said nothing, but raised his arms to heaven, opened haggard eyes, and fell struck by lightning on an armchair.
080.000 The accusation.
080.001 M. d'Avrigny soon called the magistrate to him, who seemed a second corpse in that funeral chamber.
080.002 "Oh, death is in my house!" cried Villefort.
080.003 - "Say the crime," replied the doctor.
080.004 --Monsieur d'Avrigny!" cried Villefort, "I cannot express to you all that is happening in me at this moment; it is fright, it is pain, it is madness.
080.005 -- Yes, said M. d'Avrigny with imposing calm: but I believe that it is time for us to act; I believe that it is time for us to oppose a dam to this torrent of mortality. As for me, I do not feel capable of carrying such secrets any longer, without the hope of soon bringing out the vengeance for society and the victims."
080.006 Villefort cast a dark look around him.
080.007 "In my house!" he murmured, "in my house!
080.008 --Let's see, magistrate," said D'Avrigny, "be a man; interpreter of the law, honor yourself by a complete immolation.
080.009 -- You make me shudder, doctor, an immolation!
080.010 -- I said the word.
080.011 --So you suspect someone?
080.012 -- I suspect no one; death knocks at your door, it enters, it goes, not blind, but intelligent as it is, from room to room. Well, I follow its trail, I recognize its passage, I adopt the wisdom of the ancients: I grope; for my friendship for your family, for my respect for you are two blindfolds applied to my eyes; well....
080.013 --Oh, speak, speak, doctor, I will have courage.
080.014 -- Well, sir, you have at home, in the bosom of your house, in your family perhaps, one of those dreadful phenomena such as every century produces. Locust and Agrippina, living at the same time, are an exception which proves the fury of the Providence to lose the Roman empire, soiled by so many crimes. Brunehaut and Frédégonde are the results of the hard work of a civilization at its genesis, in which man learned to dominate the spirit, even if it was by sending the darkness. Well, all these women had been or were still young and beautiful. One had seen blooming on their foreheads, or on their foreheads was still blooming, this same flower of innocence that one also finds on the forehead of the guilty one who is in your house."
080.015 Villefort uttered a cry, clasped his hands together, and looked at the doctor with a pleading gesture.
080.016 But the doctor continued without pity:
080.017 "Seek to whom the crime profits, says an axiom of jurisprudence....
080.018 --Doctor!" cried Villefort, "alas, doctor, how many times has the justice of men not been deceived by these fatal words! I don't know, but it seems to me that this crime ....
080.019 --Ah, so you admit at last that crime exists?
080.020 -- Yes, I admit it. What do you want? But let me continue. It seems to me, I say, that this crime falls on me alone and not on the victims. I suspect some disaster for me under all these strange disasters.
080.021 -- Oh man! murmured d'Avrigny; the most selfish of all animals, the most personal of all creatures, who always believes that the earth turns, that the sun shines, that death reaps for him alone; ant cursing God from the top of a grassy bon! And those who have lost their lives, have they lost nothing? M. de Saint-Méran, Mme de Saint-Méran, M. Noirtier....
080.022 -How? M. Noirtier!
080.023 -- Oh yes! Do you think, for example, that this unfortunate servant was wanted? No, no: like Shakespeare's Polonius, he died for another. It was Noirtier who had to drink the lemonade, it was Noirtier who drank it according to the logical order of things: the other drank it only by accident; and, although it was Barrois who died, it was Noirtier who had to die.
080.024 --But then how did my father not die?
080.025 -- I already told you, one evening, in the garden, after the death of Mme. de Saint-Méran; because his body was made for the use of this very poison; because the dose that was insignificant for him was mortal for anyone else; because, finally, no one knows, not even the assassin, that for a year I have been treating the paralysis of M. Noirtier with brucine, while the assassin does not ignore, and he has made sure of it by experience, that brucine is a violent poison.
080.026 -My God! my God!" murmured Villefort, wringing his arms.
080.027 -Follow the criminal's steps; he is killing M. de Saint-Méran.
080.028 --Oh, doctor!
080.029 --I would swear to it; what I have been told of the symptoms agrees too well with what I have seen with my eyes."
080.030 Villefort stopped fighting, and gave a groan.
080.031 "He kills M. de Saint-Méran," repeated the doctor, "he kills Mme de Saint-Méran: a double inheritance to collect."
080.032 Villefort wiped the sweat that ran down his forehead.
080.033 "Listen well.
080.034 -- Alas!" stammered Villefort, "I don't lose a word, not a single one.
080.035 --M. Noirtier," continued M. d'Avrigny in his pitiless voice, "M. Noirtier had once tested against you, against your family, in favor of the poor at last; M. Noirtier is spared, nothing is expected of him. But he has no sooner destroyed his first will, no sooner made the second, than, lest he make a third, they strike him: the will is dated the day before yesterday, I believe; you see, there is no time to lose.
080.036 -- Oh, thank you, Mr. d'Avrigny.
080.037 --No mercy, sir; the doctor has a sacred mission on earth, it is to fulfill it that he has gone back to the sources of life and descended into the mysterious darkness of death. When the crime has been committed, and God, frightened no doubt, turns his gaze away from the criminal, it is up to the doctor to say: Here he is!
080.038 --Grace for my daughter, sir!" murmured Villefort.
080.039 --You see that it was you who named her, you, her father!
080.040 --Grace for Valentine! Listen, it is impossible. I would rather accuse myself! Valentine, a heart of diamonds, a lily of innocence!
080.041 --No mercy, Monsieur le Procureur du Roi, the crime is flagrant: Mlle. de Villefort herself packed the medicine that was sent to M. de Saint-Méran, and M. de Saint-Méran is dead.
080.042 "Mlle de Villefort prepared the herbal teas for Mme de Saint-Méran, and Mme de Saint-Méran died.
080.043 "Mlle de Villefort took from the hands of Barrois, who was sent outside, the jug of lemonade that the old man usually empties in the morning, and the old man escaped only by a miracle.
080.044 "Mlle de Villefort is the guilty one! She is the poisoner! Mr. King's Attorney, I denounce Mlle de Villefort to you, do your duty.
080.045 --Doctor, I no longer resist, I no longer defend myself, I believe you, but, for pity's sake, spare my life, my honor!
080.046 --Monsieur de Villefort," continued the doctor with increasing force, "there are circumstances in which I cross all the limits of foolish human circumspection. If your daughter had only committed a first crime, and I saw her meditating on a second, I would say to you: Warn her, punish her, let her spend the rest of her life in some cloister, in some convent, crying, praying. If she had committed a second crime, I would say to you: "Here, Monsieur de Villefort, here is a poison that has no known antidote, as quick as thought, as fast as lightning, as deadly as lightning, give her this poison by commending her soul to God, and thus save your honor and your days, for it is you that she wants. And I see her approaching your bedside with her hypocritical smiles and her sweet exhortations! Woe to you, Monsieur de Villefort, if you do not hasten to strike first! This is what I would say to you if she had only killed two people; but she has seen three agonies, she has contemplated three dying men, she has knelt beside three corpses; to the executioner the poisoner! You speak of your honor, do as I tell you, and immortality awaits you!"
080.047 Villefort fell to his knees.
080.048 "Listen," he said, "I don't have that strength that you have, or rather that you wouldn't have if, instead of my daughter Valentine, it were a question of your daughter Madeleine."
080.049 The doctor turned pale.
080.050 "Doctor, every man son of woman is born to suffer and die; doctor, I will suffer, and I will wait for death.
080.051 -Beware, said M. d'Avrigny, it will be slow... this death; you will see it approaching after having struck your father, your wife, your son perhaps."
080.052 Villefort, suffocating, embraced the doctor's arm.
080.053 "Listen to me!" he cried, "pity me, help me.... No, my daughter is not guilty.... Take us to court, I will say again: "No, my daughter is not guilty" there is no crime in my house.... I do not want, you hear, that there is a crime in my house; because when the crime enters somewhere, it is like death, it does not enter alone. Listen, what does it matter to you if I die murdered? Are you my friend? Are you a man? No, you are a doctor!... Well, I say to you: "No, my daughter will not be dragged by me to the hands of the executioner!..." Ah! here is an idea that devours me, that pushes me like a fool to dig my chest with my nails!... And if you were mistaken, doctor! if it were another than my daughter! If, one day, I came, pale as a ghost to tell you: Murderer! you killed my daughter .... If that happened, I am a Christian, Mr. d'Avrigny, and yet I would kill myself!
080.054 - "That's fine," said the doctor after a moment's silence, "I'll wait.
080.055 Villefort looked at him as if he still doubted his words.
080.056 "Only," continued M. d'Avrigny in a slow and solemn voice, "if any of your household fall ill, if you yourself feel stricken, do not call me, for I will not come again. I am willing to share this terrible secret with you, but I don't want shame and remorse to grow and flourish in my conscience, as crime and misfortune will grow and flourish in your house.
080.057 -Are you abandoning me, Doctor?
080.058 -- Yes, for I cannot follow you any further, and I will only stop at the foot of the scaffold. Some other revelation will come which will bring an end to this terrible tragedy. Farewell.
080.059 --Doctor, I beg you!
080.060 --All the horrors that stain my mind make your house odious and fatal. Farewell, sir.
080.061 - One word, just one more word, doctor! You are leaving me with all the horror of the situation, a horror that you have increased by what you have revealed to me. But of the instantaneous, sudden death of this poor old servant, what will be said?
080.062 -That's right," said M. d'Avrigny, "take me back."
080.063 The doctor went out first, M. de Villefort followed him; the servants, worried, were in the corridors and on the stairs through which the doctor was to pass.
080.064 "Sir," said d'Avrigny to Villefort, speaking loudly so that everyone could hear him, "poor Barrois has been too sedentary for some years: he, who loved so much with his master to run on horseback or in a carriage to the four corners of Europe, has killed himself in this monotonous service around an armchair. The blood became heavy. He was plump, his neck was fat and short, he was struck by a lightning apoplexy, and I was warned too late.
080.065 "By the way," he added quietly, "be sure to throw that cup of violets into the ashes."
080.066 And the doctor, without touching Villefort's hand, without going back for a single moment on what he had said, went out escorted by the tears and lamentations of all the people in the house.
080.067 That same evening, all of Villefort's servants, who had gathered in the kitchen and talked with each other at length, came to ask Mme de Villefort for permission to retire. No instance, no proposal for an increase in wages could hold them back; to every word they replied:
080.068 "We want to leave because death is in the house."
080.069 So they left, in spite of the prayers that were made to them, testifying that their regrets were keen to leave such good masters, and especially Miss Valentine, so good, so beneficent and so gentle.
080.070 Villefort, at these words, looked at Valentine.
080.071 She was crying.
080.072 Strange thing! through the emotion which these tears made him feel, he also looked at Mme de Villefort, and it seemed to him that a fleeting and dark smile had passed over her thin lips, like those meteors which one sees sliding, sinister, between two clouds, at the bottom of a stormy sky.
081.000 The room of the retired baker.
081.001 The very evening of the day when the Count de Morcerf had left Danglars' house with a shame and a fury that the banker's coldness makes conceivable, M. Andrea Cavalcanti, his hair curled and shining, his moustaches sharpened, his white gloves drawing his nails, had entered, almost standing on his phaeton, into the courtyard of the banker's house in the Chaussée-d'Antin.
081.002 At the end of ten minutes of conversation in the salon, he had found a way to lead Danglars into a window recess, and there, after a skilful preamble, he had exposed the torments of his life, since the departure of his noble father. Since the departure, he had, he said, in the banker's family, where he had been kindly received as a son, he had found all the guarantees of happiness which a man must always seek before the whims of passion, and, as for passion itself, he had had the happiness of meeting it in the beautiful eyes of Mlle.
081.003 Danglars listened with the deepest attention; he had already been waiting for this declaration for two or three days, and when it finally arrived, his eye dilated as much as it had been covered and darkened by listening to Morcerf.
081.004 However, he did not want to accept the proposal of the young man without making some observations of conscience.
081.005 "Mr. Andrea," he said to him, "aren't you a little young to be thinking of marriage?
081.006 "But no, sir," Cavalcanti continued, "I don't think so, at least: in Italy, the great lords marry young, in general; it is a logical custom. Life is so fortunate that one must seize happiness as soon as it passes within one's reach.
081.007 - "Now, sir," said Danglars, "admitting that your proposals, which honor me, are accepted by my wife and daughter, with whom shall we debate the interests? It is, it seems to me, an important negotiation that only fathers know how to handle properly for the happiness of their children.
081.008 --Monsieur, my father is a wise man, full of propriety and reason. He foresaw the probable circumstance in which I would feel the desire to establish myself in France: he therefore left me, when I left, with all the papers which establish my identity, a letter by which he assures me, in the event that I make a choice which is agreeable to him, one hundred and fifty thousand pounds of income, starting from the day of my marriage. It is, as far as I can judge, the quarter of the income of my father.
081.009 --Myself, said Danglars, I have always intended to give my daughter five hundred thousand francs by marrying her; besides, she is my only heiress.
081.010 --Well, says Andrea, you see, the thing would be for the best, supposing that my request is not rejected by Baroness Danglars and by Miss Eugenie. Here we are at the head of one hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds of income. Let us suppose one thing, that I obtain from the marquis that instead of paying me the annuity he give me the capital (it would not be easy, I know it well, but finally it can be done), you would make us worth these two or three millions, and two or three millions in skilful hands can always yield ten per cent.
081.011 -- I never take more than four, said the banker, and even three and a half. But to my son-in-law, I would take five, and we would share the profits.
081.012 --Well, wonderfully, father-in-law," said Cavalcanti, allowing himself to be drawn into the somewhat vulgar nature which, from time to time, in spite of his efforts, burst the veneer of aristocracy with which he tried to cover them.
081.013 But at once recovering himself:
081.014 "Oh, pardon me, sir," he said, "you see, hope alone makes me almost mad, what would be reality?
081.015 --But, said Danglars, who, for his part, did not realize how this conversation, disinterested at first, was rapidly turning into a business deal, there is undoubtedly a portion of your fortune that your father cannot refuse you?
081.016 -What?" asked the young man.
081.017 --The one that comes from your mother.
081.018 -- Oh, certainly, the one that comes from my mother, Leonora Corsinari.
081.019 --And how much can this portion of fortune amount to?
081.020 --My faith, said Andrea, I assure you, sir, that I have never stopped my mind on this subject, but I estimate it at two millions at least."
081.021 Danglars felt that sort of joyful suffocation which is felt, either by the miser who finds a lost treasure, or by the man ready to drown himself who finds solid ground under his feet instead of the void in which he was about to sink.
081.022 "Well, sir," said Andrea, greeting the banker with tender respect, "may I hope....
081.023 --Mr. Andrea, said Danglars, hope, and believe well that if no obstacle of your share stops the progress of this business, it is concluded. But," said Danglars reflecting, "how is it that M. le Comte de Monte-Cristo, your boss in this Parisian world, has not come with you to make this request?"
081.024 Andrea blushed imperceptibly.
081.025 "I have come from the Count's house, sir," he said, "he is undoubtedly a charming man, but of inconceivable originality; he has approved of me greatly, he has even told me that he did not believe that my father would hesitate for a moment to give me the capital instead of the annuity; he has promised me his influence to help me obtain this from him, but he has declared to me that, personally, he had never taken, and would never take upon himself, this responsibility of proposing a marriage. But I must do him this justice, he deigned to add that, if he had ever deplored this repugnance, it was about me, since he thought the projected union would be happy and suitable. Besides, if he does not want to do anything officially, he reserves the right to answer you, he told me, when you speak to him.
081.026 --Ah, very well.
081.027 --Now, says Andrea with his most charming smile, I finished speaking to the father-in-law and I address myself to the banker.
081.028 --What do you want from him, let's see? said Danglars in his turn, laughing.
081.029 -- It is the day after tomorrow that I have something like four thousand francs to collect from you; but the Count understood that the month I was about to enter would perhaps bring an increase in expenses which my little boy's income would not be able to meet, and here is a voucher for twenty thousand francs which he has, I will not say given, but offered me. It is signed by his hand, as you can see; does that suit you?
081.030 - "Bring me some like that for a million, I'll take them," said Danglars, putting the voucher in his pocket. I am not going to be able to do anything about it, but I am going to do something about it, and I am not going to do anything about it.
081.031 --But at ten o'clock in the morning, if you please; the sooner the better: I should like to go to the country tomorrow.
081.032 --So, at ten o'clock, at the Hotel des Princes, still?
081.033 --Yes."
081.034 The next day, with an exactness which did credit to the punctuality of the banker, the twenty-four thousand francs were at the young man's, who actually went out, leaving two hundred francs for Caderousse. This exit had, on the part of Andrea, for principal goal to avoid his dangerous friend; also he returned the evening as late as possible.
081.035 But no sooner had he set foot on the pavement of the courtyard than he found before him the concierge of the hotel, who was waiting for him, cap in hand.
081.036 "Sir," he said, "this man has come.
081.037 --What man?" asked Andrea carelessly, as if he had forgotten the one he remembered too well.
081.038 --The one to whom Your Excellency is giving this small annuity.
081.039 --Ah yes, says Andrea, that old servant of my father. Well, you gave him the two hundred francs I had left for him.
081.040 --Yes, Excellency, precisely."
081.041 Andrea called himself Excellency.
081.042 "But," continued the concierge, "he didn't want to take them."
081.043 Andrea paled; only, as it was night, nobody saw him paling.
081.044 "How! he did not want to take them?" he said in a slightly moved voice.
081.045 --No! He wanted to speak to Your Excellency. I answered that you had gone out; he insisted. But at last he seemed to be convinced, and gave me this letter which he had brought all sealed.
081.046 -- Let us see", said Andrea.
081.047 He read by the lantern of his phaeton:
081.048 "You know where I live; I wait for you tomorrow at nine in the morning."
081.049 Andrea questioned the seal to see if it had been forced and if indiscreet glances could have penetrated inside the letter; but it was folded in such a way, with such a luxury of rhombuses and angles, that to read it it would have been necessary to break the seal; however, the seal was perfectly intact.
081.050 "Very well," he said. Poor man! It is a very excellent creature.
081.051 And he left the janitor edified by these words, and not knowing which he should admire more, the young master or the old servant.
081.052 "Unpack quickly, and go up to my house," said Andrea to his bellboy.
081.053 In two jumps, the young man was in his room and had burned the letter of Caderousse, of which he made disappear until the ashes.
081.054 He was finishing this operation when the servant entered.
081.055 "You are the same size as me, Pierre," he said to him.
081.056 --I have that honor, Excellency," replied the servant.
081.057 --You must have a new livery that was brought to you yesterday?
081.058 -- Yes, sir.
081.059 -- I am dealing with a little grisette to whom I do not want to tell either my title or my condition. Lend me your livery and bring me your papers, so that I can, if need be, sleep in an inn."
081.060 Peter obeyed.
081.061 Five minutes afterwards, Andrea, completely disguised, left the hotel without being recognized, took a cabriolet and was made lead to the inn of the Red Horse, in Picpus.
081.062 The next day, he left the Red Horse Inn as he had left the Hotel des Princes, that is, without being noticed, went down the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, took the boulevard as far as the Rue Ménilmontant, and, stopping at the door of the third house on the left, looked for someone to whom he could, in the absence of the concierge, ask for information.
081.063 "What are you looking for, my pretty boy?" asked the fruit grower across the street.
081.064 --M. Pailletin, please, my fat mother?" answered Andrea.
081.065 --A retired baker? asked the dairymaid.
081.066 --Actually, that's it.
081.067 --At the bottom of the court, on the left, at the third."
081.068 Andrea took the indicated path, and at the third found a hare's paw which he waved with a feeling of bad temper, from which the hurried movement of the bell was felt.
081.069 A second later, the figure of Caderousse appeared at the grating in the door.
081.070 "Ah, you are correct," he said.
081.071 And he pulled the locks.
081.072 "By Jove!" said Andrea entering.
081.073 And he threw in front of him his cap of livery which, missing the chair, fell to ground and made the turn of the room by rolling on its circumference.
081.074 "Come on, come on," said Caderousse, "don't get angry, kid! Let's see, here, I thought of you, look at the good lunch that we will have: nothing but things that you like, air!"
081.075 Andrea smelled indeed, while breathing, a smell of cooking whose coarse aromas did not miss a certain charm for a hungry stomach, it was this mixture of fresh grease and garlic which signals the Provençal cooking of a lower order; it was in addition a taste of fish gratinated, then, above all, the bitter perfume of the nutmeg and the clove. All this was exhaled from two hollow, covered dishes, placed on two stoves, and from a saucepan rustling in the oven of a cast iron stove.
081.076 In the next room, Andrea also saw a fairly clean table adorned with two place settings, two sealed bottles of wine, one green, the other yellow, a good measure of brandy in a carafon, and a macedoine of fruit in a large cabbage leaf artfully placed on an earthenware plate.
081.077 "What do you think of it?" said Caderousse; "eh, how it smells! Ah! lady! you know, I was a good cook there! do you remember how we licked our fingers in my kitchen? And you were the first to taste my sauces, and you didn't despise them, I believe.
081.078 And Caderousse began to peel more onions.
081.079 "It's good, it's good," said Andrea moodily, "by golly, if it's to have lunch with you that you've disturbed me, may the devil take you away!
081.080 -My son, says Caderousse sententiously, while eating one talks; and then, ungrateful as you are, you do not have thus pleasure to see a little your friend? Me, I cry with joy."
081.081 Caderousse, indeed, was really crying; only, it would have been difficult to say whether it was joy or onions that were operating on the lacrimal gland of the former innkeeper of the Pont du Gard.
081.082 "Shut up, hypocrite," said Andrea; "do you love me?
081.083 --Yes, I love you, or the devil takes me away; it is a weakness, says Caderousse, I know it well, but it is stronger than me.
081.084 -This does not prevent you from having made me come for some perfidy.
081.085 -Caderousse said, wiping his large knife on his apron, if I didn't love you, would I put up with the miserable life you are making for me? Look a little, you have on your back the dress of your servant, therefore you have a servant; me, I do not have any, and I am forced to peel my vegetables myself: you ignore my cooking, because you dine at the table d'hôte of the hotel of the Princes or at the Café de Paris. Well, I too could have a servant; I too could have a tilbury; I too could dine wherever I wanted: well, why do I deprive myself of that? Let's see, just admit that I could, eh?"
081.086 And a perfectly clear look from Caderousse finished the meaning of the sentence.
081.087 "Well," said Andrea, "let's say you love me: then why do you demand that I come to lunch with you?
081.088 --But to see you, kid.
081.089 --To see me, what's the use? since we have made all our conditions in advance.
081.090 -- "Dear friend," said Caderousse, "are there wills without codicils? But you came to have lunch first, didn't you? Well, let's see, sit down, and let's start with these sardines and this fresh butter, which I have put on vine leaves for you, villain. Ah, yes, you're looking at my room, my four straw chairs, my pictures at three francs a frame. Dame! what do you want, it is not the hotel of the Princes.
081.091 --Come on, you are disgusted now; you are no longer happy, you who only wanted to have the air of a retired baker."
081.092 Caderousse heaved a sigh.
081.093 "Well, what do you have to say? You have seen your dream realized.
081.094 --I have to say that it is a dream, a retired baker, my poor Benedetto, it is rich, it has income.
081.095 --Goddamn! you have income.
081.096 --Me?
081.097 --Yes, you, since I bring you your two hundred francs."
081.098 Caderousse shrugged his shoulders.
081.099 "It's humiliating," he said, "to receive money given reluctantly in this way, ephemeral money, which can be gone from one day to the next. You see that I am obliged to make savings in case your prosperity does not last. My friend, fortune is fickle, as the chaplain of the regiment said. I know very well that your prosperity is immense, scoundrel; you are going to marry Danglars' daughter.
081.100 --What! of Danglars?
081.101 --And certainly, from Danglars! Should I not say Baron Danglars? It is as if I were to say of Count Benedetto. He was a friend, Danglars, and if his memory were not so bad, he should invite me to your wedding... since he came to mine... yes, yes, yes, to mine! Dame! he was not so proud in those days; he was a little clerk at this good Mr. Morrel's. I dined more than once with him and the Count of Morcerf .... Go, you see that I have beautiful knowledge and that if I wanted to cultivate them a little, we would meet in the same salons.
081.102 --Come on, your jealousy makes you see rainbows, Caderousse.
081.103 - It is well, Benedetto mio, one knows what one says. Perhaps one day one will also put on one's Sunday suit, and will go and say to a porte cochere: "The cord, please!" In the meantime, sit down and eat."
081.104 Caderousse set the example and began to eat with a good appetite, and praising all the dishes he served to his host.
081.105 The latter seemed to take his side, bravely uncorked the bottles and attacked the bouillabaisse and the cod au gratin with garlic and oil.
081.106 "Ah, friend," said Caderousse, "it seems that you are making up with your former butler?
081.107 --My faith, yes, answered Andrea, in whom, young and vigorous as he was, appetite prevailed for the moment over all other things.
081.108 --And do you find it good, you rascal?
081.109 --So good, that I don't understand how a man who makes money and eats such good things can find that life is bad.
081.110 -- You see," said Caderousse, "it is that all my happiness is spoiled by a single thought.
081.111 -- Which one?
081.112 --It is that I am living at the expense of a friend, I who have always bravely earned my living myself.
081.113 --Oh, oh, never mind, says Andrea, I have enough for two, don't be embarrassed.
081.114 -- No, really; you will believe me if you want, at the end of each month, I have remorse.
081.115 -Good Caderousse!
081.116 --So much so that yesterday I didn't want to take the two hundred francs.
081.117 --Yes, you wanted to talk to me; but is it really remorse?
081.118 --The real remorse; and then an idea came to me."
081.119 Andrea shuddered; he always shuddered at Caderousse's ideas.
081.120 "It is miserable, you see," continued the latter, "to be always waiting for the end of a month.
081.121 --Eh!" said Andrea philosophically, determined to see his companion come, "isn't life spent waiting? I, for example, do I do anything else? Well, I take patience, don't I?
081.122 -- Yes, because instead of waiting for two hundred miserable francs, you wait for five or six thousand, maybe ten, maybe even twelve; for you are a secretive person: over there, you always had beans, piggy banks that you tried to get away from this poor friend Caderousse. Fortunately he had a fine nose, the friend Caderousse in question.
081.123 - Now you're going to start rambling again, says Andrea, talking and talking again about the past! But what is the use of harping on like that, I ask you?
081.124 --Ah, it is that you are twenty-one years old, and that you can forget the past; I am fifty, and I am forced to remember it. But anyway, let's get back to business.
081.125 -- Yes.
081.126 --I meant that if I were in your place ....
081.127 --Well?
081.128 --I would realize....
081.129 --How! you would realize....
081.130 --Yes, I would ask for a semester in advance, under the pretext that I want to become eligible and that I'm going to buy a farm; then with my semester I would decamp.
081.131 --Here, here, here, Andrea said, that's not so bad a thought, perhaps!
081.132 -My dear friend, said Caderousse, eat of my kitchen and follow my advice; you will not find yourself worse off, physically and morally.
081.133 --Well, but, says Andrea, why don't you follow yourself the advice that you give? Why don't you realize a semester, a year even, and retire to Brussels? Instead of looking like a retired baker, you would look like a banker in the exercise of his functions: that is well worn.
081.134 --But how on earth do you expect me to retire with twelve hundred francs?
081.135 --Ah! Caderousse, said Andrea, how demanding you are! Two months ago, you were dying of hunger.
081.136 --Appetite comes by eating, said Caderousse by showing his teeth like a monkey which laughs or like a tiger which scolds. Also," he added, cutting with those same teeth, so white and sharp, in spite of age, an enormous mouthful of bread, "I have made a plan."
081.137 Caderousse's plans frightened Andrea even more than his ideas; the ideas were only the germ, the plan was the realization.
081.138 "Let us see this plan, he said; it must be pretty!
081.139 --Why not? The plan by which we left Mr. Thing's establishment, whose plan was it, eh? mine, I presume; it was no worse, it seems to me, since here we are!
081.140 -- I don't say," replied Andrea, "you sometimes have good things; but let's see your plan.
081.141 -- Let us see, continued Caderousse, can you, without spending a penny, make me have about fifteen thousand francs... no, fifteen thousand francs is not enough, I do not want to become an honest man for less than thirty thousand francs?
081.142 --No," Andrea answered curtly, "no, I can't.
081.143 --You have not understood me, it seems, Caderousse replied coldly with a calm air; I told you without paying a penny.
081.144 --Don't you want me to steal and spoil my whole business, and yours with mine, and take us back there?
081.145 --Oh! me, said Caderousse, I don't mind being taken back; I'm a strange body, you know: I sometimes miss my comrades; it's not like you, heartless one, who would like never to see them again!"
081.146 Andrea did more than shudder this time, he turned pale.
081.147 "Let's see, Caderousse, no nonsense," he said.
081.148 --Eh! no, so be quiet, my little Benedetto; but indicate to me a small means of earning these thirty thousand francs without meddling in anything; you will let me do it, that's all!
081.149 -- Well, I'll see, I'll look for it, said Andrea.
081.150 --But, in the meantime, you will push my month to five hundred francs, I have a mania, I would like to take a maid!
081.151 -- Well, you will have your five hundred francs, says Andrea: but it is heavy for me, my poor Caderousse... you are abusing yourself....
081.152 --Bah! said Caderousse; since you draw from coffers that have no bottom.
081.153 One would have said that Andrea waited there for his companion, so much his eye shone of a fast flash which, it is true, went out at once.
081.154 "That is the truth," answered Andrea, "and my protector is excellent for me.
081.155 - "This dear protector!" said Caderousse; "so he makes you a month?
081.156 --Five thousand francs, said Andrea.
081.157 --As many thousand as you make me cents, resumed Caderousse; in truth, there are only bastards to have happiness. Five thousand francs a month.... What on earth can one do with all that?
081.158 --Eh, my God! it is very quickly spent; also, I am like you, I would like to have a capital.
081.159 --A capital... yes... I understand, everyone would like to have a capital.
081.160 -- Well, I'll have one.
081.161 -- And who will make it for you? Your prince?
081.162 -- Yes, my prince; unfortunately I must wait.
081.163 --What are you waiting for?" asked Caderousse.
081.164 --His death.
081.165 --The death of your prince?
081.166 --Yes.
081.167 --How so?
081.168 --Because he put me in his will.
081.169 --Really?
081.170 --Speech of honor!
081.171 --For how much?
081.172 --Five hundred thousand!
081.173 --Nothing but that; thank you for the little.
081.174 --It is as I tell you.
081.175 --Come on, no way!
081.176 --Caderousse, are you my friend?
081.177 --How can that be? In life and in death.
081.178 -- Well, I'm going to tell you a secret.
081.179 --Say.
081.180 --But listen.
081.181 --Oh, my goodness! Mute as a fish.
081.182 --Well, I think...."
081.183 Andrea stopped, looking around.
081.184 "You believe?... Don't be afraid, for God's sake! we are alone.
081.185 --I believe that I found my father.
081.186 --Your real father?
081.187 --Yes.
081.188 --Not Father Cavalcanti.
081.189 --No, since that one has gone back; the real one, as you say.
081.190 --And this father is ....
081.191 -- Well, Caderousse, it's the Count of Monte Cristo.
081.192 --Bah!
081.193 --Yes; you understand, so everything explains itself. He cannot confess to me out loud, as it seems, but he has me recognized by M. Cavalcanti, to whom he gives fifty thousand francs for it.
081.194 --Fifty thousand francs to be your father! I would have accepted for half price, for twenty thousand, for fifteen thousand! How could you not think of me?
081.195 --Did I know that, since everything was done while we were there?
081.196 --Ah, it's true. And you say that, by his will...?
081.197 -- He leaves me five hundred thousand pounds.
081.198 --Are you sure?
081.199 -- He showed it to me; but that's not all.
081.200 --There is a codicil, as I was saying earlier!
081.201 --Probably.
081.202 -- And in this codicil?
081.203 --He recognizes me.
081.204 --Oh! the good man of a father, the brave man of a father, the honest man of a father! said Caderousse, making a plate turn in the air which he held between his two hands.
081.205 --There! say again that I have secrets for you!
081.206 -- No, and your trust honors you in my eyes. And your prince of a father, is he rich, extremely rich?
081.207 -- I think so. He doesn't know his fortune.
081.208 --Is that possible?
081.209 --I can see that, as I am received at his house at all hours. The other day it was a banker's boy who brought him fifty thousand francs in a wallet as big as your briefcase; yesterday it was a banker who brought him a hundred thousand francs in gold."
081.210 Caderousse was dumbfounded; it seemed to him that the words of the young man had the sound of metal, and that he heard cascades of louis rolling down.
081.211 "And you are going to that house?" he exclaimed naively.
081.212 --When I want."
081.213 Caderousse remained thoughtful for a moment. It was easy to see that he was turning over in his mind some deep thought.
081.214 Then suddenly:
081.215 "How I would like to see all this!" he cried, "and how beautiful it must all be!
081.216 --The fact is, says Andrea, that it is magnificent!
081.217 --And doesn't he live on the Champs-Élysées?
081.218 -- Number thirty.
081.219 --Ah! says Caderousse, number thirty?
081.220 --Yes, a beautiful isolated house, between courtyard and garden, you know only that.
081.221 --That's possible; but it's not the outside that occupies me, it's the inside: the beautiful furniture, eh! that must be in there?
081.222 -Have you ever seen the Tuileries?
081.223 -- No.
081.224 -- Well, it is more beautiful.
081.225 --So, Andrea, it must be good to bend down when this good Monte Cristo drops his purse?
081.226 --Oh, my God! it is not worth waiting for that moment, says Andrea, money hangs out in that house like fruit in an orchard.
081.227 --So, you should take me there with you one day.
081.228 --Is that possible? And in what capacity?
081.229 --You're right; but you've made my mouth water; I absolutely must see that; I'll find a way.
081.230 --No nonsense, Caderousse!
081.231 -- I will present myself as a frotteur.
081.232 --There are carpets everywhere.
081.233 --Ah! you scoundrel! then I must be content to see that in imagination.
081.234 --That's the best thing, believe me.
081.235 -At least try to make me understand what it can be.
081.236 --How can I?
081.237 --Nothing could be easier. Is it big?
081.238 -- Not too big and not too small.
081.239 --But how is it distributed?
081.240 --I would need ink and paper to make a plan.
081.241 --Here it is!" said Caderousse briskly.
081.242 And he went to look on an old secretary for a sheet of white paper, some ink and a pen.
081.243 "Here," said Caderousse, "trace all that to me on paper, my son."
081.244 Andrea took the quill with an imperceptible smile and began.
081.245 "The house, as I told you, is between yard and garden, you see, like this?"
081.246 And Andrea traced the garden, the yard and the house.
081.247 "Big walls?
081.248 --No, eight or ten feet at most.
081.249 --That's not wise, said Caderousse.
081.250 --In the courtyard, boxes of orange trees, lawns, flowerbeds.
081.251 --And no wolf traps?
081.252 --No.
081.253 --The stables?
081.254 --The two sides of the gate, where you see, there."
081.255 Andrea continued his plan.
081.256 "Let's see the first floor," said Caderousse.
081.257 --On the first floor, dining room, two lounges, billiard room, stairs in the vestibule, and a small hidden staircase.
081.258 --Windows?
081.259 --Perfect windows, so beautiful, so wide that, my goodness, yes, I think a man of your size would pass through every pane.
081.260 --Why on earth do we have stairs when we have such windows?
081.261 -- What do you expect? Luxury.
081.262 --But shutters?
081.263 -- Yes, shutters, but they are never used. An original, this Count of Monte Cristo, who likes to see the sky even at night!
081.264 -- And the servants, where do they sleep?
081.265 -- Oh, they have their own house. Imagine a pretty shed on the right as you enter, where the ladders are kept. Well, on this shed there is a collection of rooms for the servants, with bells corresponding to the rooms.
081.266 --Ah, hell, bells!
081.267 - You say?
081.268 - I say nothing. I say that it costs a lot of money to put up the bells; and what good is that, I ask you?
081.269 -In the past there was a dog that walked at night in the courtyard, but they took him to the house at Auteuil, you know, the one you came to?
081.270 --Yes.
081.271 --I said to him only yesterday: "That is imprudent of you, Monsieur le Comte, for when you go to Auteuil and take your servants, the house is left alone."
081.272 --Well, did he ask afterwards?
081.273 --Well, afterwards, some fine day you will be robbed.
081.274 --What did he answer?
081.275 --What did he answer?
081.276 -- Yes.
081.277 --He answered: "Well, what do I care if I am robbed?"
081.278 --Andrea, there is some secretary to mechanics.
081.279 --What do you mean?
081.280 --Yes, who takes the thief in a grid and plays a tune. I was told that there were some like that at the last exhibition.
081.281 -- He simply has a mahogany secretary to which I have always seen the key.
081.282 --And it is not stolen?
081.283 -- No, the people who serve him are completely devoted to him.
081.284 -- There must be some change in that secretary, must there?
081.285 -- There may be... one cannot know what there is.
081.286 -- And where is it?
081.287 --At the first.
081.288 --Tell me the plan of the second floor, the little one, as you told me about the first floor.
081.289 --That's easy."
081.290 And Andrea took up the pen again.
081.291 "On the second floor, you see, there is an anteroom, a sitting room; to the right of the sitting room, a library and a study; to the left of the sitting room, a bedroom and a toilet. It is in the toilet that the famous secretary is.
081.292 --And a window in the bathroom?
081.293 --Two, there and there."
081.294 And Andrea drew two windows to the room which, on the plan, made the corner and appeared as a lesser square added to the long square of the bedroom.
081.295 Caderousse became dreamy.
081.296 "And does he often go to Auteuil?" he asked.
081.297 --Two or three times a week; tomorrow, for example, he must go there to spend the day and night.
081.298 --Are you sure?
081.299 -- He invited me to go there for dinner.
081.300 -- That's the way to live, said Caderousse: house in the city, house in the country!
081.301 -- That's what it is to be rich.
081.302 --And will you go to dinner?
081.303 -- Probably.
081.304 --When you dine there, do you sleep there?
081.305 -- When it pleases me. I am at the Count's as if I were at home."
081.306 Caderousse looked at the young man as if to wring the truth from the bottom of his heart. But Andrea drew a cigar box from his pocket, took a Havana from it, lit it quietly and began to smoke it without affectation.
081.307 "When do you want the five hundred francs?" he asked Caderousse.
081.308 --But right away, if you have them."
081.309 Andrea drew twenty-five louis from his pocket.
081.310 "Jackets," said Caderousse; "no, thank you!
081.311 --Well, do you despise them?
081.312 --I esteem them, on the contrary, but I don't want them.
081.313 --You'll earn the change, fool: gold is worth five cents.
081.314 --That's it, and then the money-changer will have friend Caderousse followed, and then we'll get hold of him, and then he'll have to say which farmers pay him his royalties in gold. No nonsense, the boy: just money, round coins bearing the effigy of some monarch. Anyone can reach a five-franc coin.
081.315 -You understand that I don't have five hundred francs on me: I would have had to take a commissionaire.
081.316 -- Well, leave them at your place, with your concierge, he is a good man, I will go and get them.
081.317 -Today?
081.318 -- No, tomorrow; today I have no time.
081.319 -- Well, so be it; tomorrow, when I leave for Auteuil, I'll leave them.
081.320 -- Can I count on that?
081.321 --Perfectly.
081.322 -I'm going to arrest my maid in advance, you see.
081.323 --Stop. But that's it, isn't it? You won't torment me anymore?
081.324 --Never."
081.325 Caderousse had become so gloomy, that Andrea feared he would be forced to notice this change. So he redoubled his cheerfulness and carelessness.
081.326 "How cheerful you are," said Caderousse; "it seems as if you already had your inheritance!
081.327 --No, unfortunately!... But the day I hold it....
081.328 --Well?
081.329 --Well, friends will be remembered; that's all I'm saying.
081.330 -- Yes, how well you remember!
081.331 --What do you want? I thought you wanted to ransom me.
081.332 --Me! oh, what an idea! I, on the contrary, am going to give you a friend's advice.
081.333 -What is it?
081.334 -It is to leave here the diamond you have on your finger. Do you want to get us caught? Do you want to lose us both, so that you do such foolish things?
081.335 --Why is that? said Andrea.
081.336 --How! you take a livery, you disguise yourself as a servant, and you keep on your finger a diamond of four to five thousand francs!
081.337 --Pest! you estimate just! Why don't you become an auctioneer?
081.338 --I know about diamonds; I've had them.
081.339 --I advise you to boast of it", said Andrea, who, without being incensed, as Caderousse feared, by this new extortion, complacently delivered the ring.
081.340 Caderousse looked at it so closely that it was clear to Andrea that he was examining whether the edges of the cut were sharp.
081.341 "It is a false diamond," said Caderousse.
081.342 --All right, Andrea said, are you joking?
081.343 --Oh! don't get angry, we can see."
081.344 And Caderousse went to the window, slid the diamond on the pane; the glass was heard to scream.
081.345 "_Confiteor_!" said Caderousse, passing the diamond on his little finger, "I was mistaken; but these jeweler thieves imitate stones so well, that one no longer dares to go and steal in the jewelry stores. It is still a paralyzed branch of industry.
081.346 --Well, says Andrea, is it finished? Do you still have something to ask me? Don't bother while you're at it.
081.347 -- No, you are a good companion at heart. I won't hold you back any longer, and I'll try to cure myself of my ambition.
081.348 -- But beware that in selling this diamond, what you feared would happen to you with the gold will not happen to you.
081.349 -- I won't sell it, rest assured.
081.350 -- No, not by the day after tomorrow, at least, thought the young man.
081.351 -- "You rascal!" said Caderousse, "you are going to find your lackeys, your horses, your carriage and your fiancée.
081.352 --But yes, said Andrea.
081.353 --So, I hope you will give me a nice wedding present the day you marry the daughter of my friend Danglars.
081.354 -- I already told you that it was an imagination you had in mind.
081.355 --How much dowry?
081.356 --But I tell you....
081.357 --A million?"
081.358 Andrea shrugged her shoulders.
081.359 "Go for a million," said Caderousse, "you'll never have as much as I want.
081.360 --Thank you, said the young man.
081.361 --Oh! it's from the heart, added Caderousse, laughing with his big laugh. Wait, let me drive you home.
081.362 --There's no need.
081.363 --So done.
081.364 --Why not?
081.365 --Oh! because there is a little secret at the door; it is a precautionary measure that I thought I should adopt; Huret and Fichet lock, revised and corrected by Gaspard Caderousse. I will make you a similar one when you become a capitalist.
081.366 --Thank you, said Andrea; I'll let you know eight days in advance."
081.367 They separated. Caderousse remained on the landing until he had seen Andrea not only descend the three floors, but also cross the courtyard. Then he returned hastily, closed the door carefully, and began to study, as a profound architect, the plan that Andrea had left him.
081.368 "That dear Benedetto," he said, "I think he would not be sorry to inherit, and that whoever advances the day on which he is to cash in his five hundred thousand francs will not be his meanest friend."
082.000 The break-in.
082.001 The day after the conversation we have just reported took place, the Count of Monte Cristo had indeed left for Auteuil with Ali, several servants, and some horses he wanted to try. What had especially determined this departure, which he had not even thought of the day before, and which Andrea had not thought of more than he had, was the arrival of Bertuccio, who, having returned from Normandy, brought news of the house and the corvette. The house was ready, and the corvette, which had arrived eight days before and was anchored in a small cove where it stood with its crew of six men, after having fulfilled all the required formalities, was already in a condition to set sail again.
082.002 The Count praised Bertuccio's zeal and invited him to prepare for a prompt departure, as his stay in France was not to be prolonged beyond one month.
082.003 "Now," he told him, "I may need to go in one night from Paris to Le Tréport; I want eight stops along the way that will allow me to travel fifty leagues in ten hours.
082.004 -- Your Excellency had already manifested this desire, answered Bertuccio, and the horses are ready. I bought them and billeted them myself in the most convenient places, that is, in villages where no one usually stops.
082.005 - "That's fine," said Monte Cristo, "I'll stay here for a day or two, so make arrangements accordingly."
082.006 As Bertuccio was about to go out to order everything that had to do with this stay, Baptistin opened the door; he was holding a letter on a gilt tray.
082.007 "What are you doing here?" asked the Count, seeing him all covered in dust, "I didn't ask you, did I?"
082.008 Baptistin, without answering, approached the Count and presented him with the letter.
082.009 "Important and urgent," he said.
082.010 The Count opened the letter and read:
082.011 "M. de Monte Cristo is warned that this very night a man will break into his house on the Champs-Élysées, to steal papers which he believes to be locked in the secretary of the dressing room: it is known that M. le Comte de Monte-Cristo is brave enough not to resort to the intervention of the police, an intervention which could greatly compromise the one who gives this notice. The Count, either by an opening which will give of the bedroom in the cabinet, or ambushing in the cabinet, will be able to do justice himself. Many people and many apparent precautions would certainly keep the malefactor away, and would make M. de Monte Cristo lose this opportunity of knowing an enemy which chance has brought to the attention of the person who gives this advice to the count, an advice which he would perhaps not have the opportunity of renewing if, this first enterprise failing, the malefactor should renew another."
082.012 The count's first movement was to believe in a thieves' ruse, a crude trap that signaled a mediocre danger to expose him to a more serious one. He was therefore going to have the letter brought to a police commissioner, in spite of the recommendation, and perhaps even because of the recommendation of the anonymous friend, when suddenly the idea came to him that it could be, indeed, some particular enemy of his, whom he alone could recognize and from whom, if need be, he alone could take advantage, as Fiesque had done of the Moor who had wanted to murder him. One knows the count; we do not need therefore to say that it was a spirit full of audacity and vigor which stiffened against the impossible with this energy which makes alone the superior men. By the life he had led, by the decision he had made and held to back down from nothing, the Count had come to savor unknown pleasures in the struggles he sometimes undertook against nature, which is God, and against the world, which may well pass for the devil.
082.013 "They don't want to steal my papers," said Monte Cristo, "they want to kill me; they are not thieves, they are murderers. I don't want the Prefect of Police to interfere in my private affairs. I am rich enough, my faith, to release in this the budget of his administration."
082.014 The count called Baptistin back, who had come out of the room after bringing the letter.
082.015 "You will return to Paris," he said, "you will bring back here all the servants who remain. I need all my people in Auteuil.
082.016 --But will there be no one left at home, Monsieur le Comte?" asked Baptistin.
082.017 --Si fait, le concierge.
082.018 --He will think that it is a long way from the lodge to the house.
082.019 --Well?
082.020 -- Well, one could rob the whole house without hearing the slightest noise.
082.021 --Who?
082.022 --But thieves.
082.023 --You are a fool, Mr. Baptistin; thieves, even if they robbed the whole house, would never cause me the inconvenience that a badly done service would cause me."
082.024 Baptistin bowed.
082.025 "You hear me," said the Count, "bring your comrades back from the first to the last; but let everything remain in the usual state; you will close the shutters of the first floor, that is all.
082.026 --And those on the second floor?
082.027 --You know we never close them. Come on."
082.028 The Count said that he would dine alone at his house and wanted to be served only by Ali.
082.029 He dined with his usual quietness and sobriety, and after dinner, beckoning Ali to follow him, he went out by the little door, gained the Bois de Boulogne as if he were going for a walk, took the road to Paris without affectation, and at dusk found himself in front of the house on the Champs-Élysées.
082.030 Everything was dark, only a faint light shone in the concierge's lodge, some forty steps from the house, as Baptistin had said.
082.031 Monte Cristo leaned against a tree, and, with that eye which was so rarely mistaken, probed the double alley, examined the passers-by, and plunged his gaze into the neighboring streets, in order to see if anyone was not lying in wait. After ten minutes, he was convinced that no one was watching him. He ran at once to the little door with Ali, entered hastily, and, by the service staircase, of which he had the key, returned to his bedroom, without opening or disturbing a single curtain, without the janitor himself being able to suspect that the house, which he believed to be empty, had found its principal inhabitant.
082.032 Arriving in the bedroom, the Count signaled to Ali to stop, then passed into the cabinet, which he examined; everything was in its usual state: the precious secretary in its place, and the key to the secretary. He double-locked it, took the key, returned to the bedroom door, removed the double strike of the bolt, and returned.
082.033 Meanwhile, Ali brought to a table the weapons which the Count had requested of him, namely, a short rifle and a pair of double pistols, whose superimposed barrels made it possible to aim as surely as with shooting pistols. Thus armed, the Count held the lives of five men in his hands.
082.034 It was about half past nine; the Count and Ali ate a piece of bread in haste and drank a glass of Spanish wine; then Monte Cristo slid open one of those movable panels which enabled him to see from one room into the other. He had his pistols and rifle within reach, and Ali, standing beside him, held in his hand one of those small Arab axes which have not changed their shape since the Crusades.
082.035 Through one of the bedroom windows, parallel to that of the study, the Count could see into the street.
082.036 Two hours passed in this way; it was the deepest darkness, and yet Ali, thanks to her wild nature, and yet the Count, thanks no doubt to an acquired quality, could distinguish in this night even the faintest swaying of the trees in the yard.
082.037 The little light in the porter's lodge had long since gone out.
082.038 It was to be presumed that the attack, if there really was a planned attack, would take place by the first floor staircase and not by a window. In Monte Cristo's mind, the criminals were after his life, not his money. It was therefore his bedroom that they would attack, and they would reach his bedroom either by the stolen staircase or by the cabinet window.
082.039 He placed Ali in front of the staircase door and continued to watch the cabinet.
082.040 Three quarters past eleven on the clock of the Invalides; the west wind brought on its damp puffs the gloomy vibration of the three strokes.
082.041 As the last stroke went out, the Count thought he heard a slight noise from the side of the cabinet; this first noise, or rather this first creak, was followed by a second, then a third; at the fourth, the Count knew what to expect. A firm and practiced hand was busy cutting the four sides of a window with a diamond.
082.042 The count felt his heart beating faster. However hardened to danger men may be, however well warned they may be of peril, they always understand, by the quivering of their hearts and the shivering of their flesh, the enormous difference that exists between dream and reality, between project and execution.
082.043 However, Monte Cristo only made a sign to warn Ali; the latter, understanding that the danger was on the side of the cabinet, took a step to approach his master.
082.044 Monte Cristo was eager to know which enemies and how many enemies he was dealing with.
082.045 The window where they were working was opposite the opening through which the Count looked into the cabinet. His eyes were fixed on the window, and he saw a shadow forming thicker on the darkness; then one of the panes became quite opaque, as if a sheet of paper had been stuck to it from outside, and then the pane cracked without falling out. Through the opening an arm passed by and sought the espagnolette; a second later the window turned on its hinges, and a man entered.
082.046 The man was alone.
082.047 "Here is a bold rascal," murmured the Count.
082.048 At that moment he felt Ali gently touch his shoulder; he turned around: Ali was showing him the window of the room where they were, which looked out onto the street.
082.049 Monte Cristo took three steps towards this window; he knew the exquisite delicacy of the senses of the faithful servant. Indeed, he saw another man who was detaching himself from a doorway, and, climbing on a bollard, seemed to be trying to see what was going on at the Count's house.
082.050 "Well!" he said, "there are two of them: one acts, the other watches!"
082.051 He motioned to Ali not to lose sight of the man in the street, and returned to the man in the cabinet.
082.052 The window cutter had entered and was orienting himself, arms stretched out in front.
082.053 At last he seemed to have realized everything; there were two doors in the cabinet, he went to push the locks of both.
082.054 When he approached the bedroom door, Monte Cristo thought he was coming to enter, and prepared one of his pistols; but he merely heard the sound of the locks sliding into their brass rings. It was a precaution, that is all; the nocturnal visitor, unaware of the care the Count had taken to remove the locks, could now believe himself at home and act in complete peace.
082.055 Alone and free of all his movements, the man then drew something from his large pocket, which the Count could not distinguish, placed this something on a pedestal table, then went straight to the secretary, felt it at the place of the lock, and found that, against his expectations, the key was missing.
082.056 But the window-cracker was a man of precaution and had foreseen everything; the Count soon heard that rustling of iron against iron which, when stirred, is produced by that shapeless bunch of keys which locksmiths bring when they are sent for to open a door, and to which thieves have given the name of nightingales, no doubt because of the pleasure they experience in hearing their nocturnal song, when they creak against the bolt of the lock.
082.057 "Ah! ah!" murmured Monte Cristo with a smile of disappointment, "he is only a thief."
082.058 But the man, in the darkness, could not choose the proper instrument. He then had recourse to the object he had placed on the pedestal table; he played a spring, and at once a pale light, yet bright enough to be seen, sent its golden reflection on the man's hands and face.
082.059 "Look!" said Monte Cristo suddenly, stepping back with a movement of surprise, "it's ...."
082.060 Ali raised his axe.
082.061 "Don't move," said Monte Cristo quietly, "and leave your axe there, we don't need weapons here."
082.062 Then he added a few words, still lowering his voice, for the exclamation, weak as it was, which surprise had wrung from the count, had been enough to make the man, who had remained in the pose of the ancient remover, flinch. It was an order that the count had just given, for at once Ali moved away on tiptoe, detached from the wall of the alcove a black garment and a triangular hat. Meanwhile, Monte Cristo quickly removed his frock coat, vest, and shirt, and one could, thanks to the ray of light filtering through the slit in the panel, recognize on the Count's chest one of those supple and fine tunics of steel mesh, the last of which, in this France where daggers are no longer feared, was perhaps worn by King Louis XVI, who feared the knife for his chest, and who was struck in the head by an axe.
082.063 This tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock like the hair of the count under a tonsured wig; the triangular hat, placed on the wig, completed the change of the count into an abbot.
082.064 However, the man, hearing nothing more, had risen, and while Monte Cristo was carrying out his metamorphosis, had gone straight to the secretary, whose lock was beginning to crack under his _rossignol_.
082.065 "Good!" murmured the Count, who was doubtless resting on some secret of locksmithing which must have been unknown to the door-picker, however good he was! you will be a few minutes." And he went to the window.
082.066 The man whom he had seen climbing on a bollard had dismounted, and was still walking in the street; but, singularly enough, instead of worrying about those who might be coming, either by the avenue of the Champs-Élysées or by the faubourg Saint-Honoré, he seemed preoccupied only with what was going on at the count's house, and all his movements were aimed at seeing what was happening in the cabinet.
082.067 Monte Cristo suddenly struck his forehead and let a silent laughter wander across his half-open lips.
082.068 Then he approached Ali:
082.069 "Stay here," he said to him softly, "hidden in the darkness, and whatever noise you hear, whatever happens, do not enter and show yourself unless I call you by your name."
082.070 Ali nodded that he understood and would obey.
082.071 Then Monte Cristo drew a lighted candle from a cupboard, and at the moment when the thief was most occupied with his lock, he gently opened the door, taking care that the light he held in his hand gave entirely on his face.
082.072 The door turned so gently that the thief did not hear the noise. But to his astonishment he suddenly saw the room light up.
082.073 He turned around.
082.074 "Eh! good evening, dear Monsieur Caderousse," said Monte Cristo; "what on earth are you doing here at such an hour!
082.075 - "Abbé Busoni!" cried Caderousse.
082.076 And not knowing how this strange apparition had come to him, since he had closed the doors, he dropped his bunch of false keys, and remained motionless and as if struck with stupor.
082.077 The Count went and placed himself between Caderousse and the window, thus cutting off the terrified thief's only means of retreat.
082.078 "The Abbé Busoni!" repeated Caderousse, fixing his haggard eyes on the Count.
082.079 -- "Well, no doubt, the Abbé Busoni," resumed Monte Cristo, "himself in person, and I am very glad that you recognize me, my dear Monsieur Caderousse, it proves that we have a good memory, for, if I am not mistaken, it is ten years since we last saw each other.
082.080 This calm, this irony, this power, struck Caderousse's mind with a vertiginous terror.
082.081 "The abbot! the abbot!" he murmured, clenching his fists and rattling his teeth.
082.082 --So we want to rob the Count of Monte Cristo?" continued the so-called abbot.
082.083 --Mr. Abbot, Caderousse murmured, trying to reach the window that the Count was mercilessly intercepting, "Mr. Abbot, I don't know... I beg you to believe... I swear to you ....
082.084 --A cut window pane, continued the count, a dull lantern, a bunch of nightingales, a half-forced secretary, it is clear though."
082.085 Caderousse was choking on his tie, looking for an angle to hide in, a hole through which to disappear.
082.086 "Come," said the Count, "I see that you are still the same, Monsieur l'assassin.
082.087 --Monsieur l'abbé, since you know everything, you know that it is not me, that it is Carconte; this was recognized at the trial, since they only condemned me to the galleys.
082.088 --So you've finished your time, and I find you trying to get you back there?
082.089 -- No, Father, I was freed by someone.
082.090 --That someone has done society a charming service.
082.091 --Ah! says Caderousse, I had however well promised....
082.092 --So, you are in breach of contract? interrupted Monte-Cristo.
082.093 -- Alas! yes, said Caderousse, very worried.
082.094 --Bad repeat offender.... That will lead you, if I am not mistaken, to the Place de Grève. Too bad, too bad, diavolo! as the socialites of my country say.
082.095 --Mr. Abbot, I give in to a drive....
082.096 --All the criminals say that.
082.097 --The need....
082.098 --Let it be, said Busoni disdainfully, need can lead to asking for alms, to stealing a loaf of bread from a baker's door, but not to coming to break into a secretary's house that one believes to be uninhabited. And when the jeweler Joannes had just counted you forty-five thousand francs in exchange for the diamond I had given you, and you killed him to get the diamond and the money, was that also need?
082.099 -Pardon me, Monsieur l'abbé," said Caderousse; "you have already saved me once, save me a second time.
082.100 --That does not encourage me.
082.101 --Are you alone, Monsieur l'Abbé?" asked Caderousse, joining his hands, "or do you have gendarmes there ready to take me?
082.102 -- I am all alone, said the abbot, and I will still have pity on you and let you go at the risk of the new misfortunes that my weakness can bring, if you tell me the whole truth.
082.103 --Ah! Monsieur l'abbé!" cried Caderousse, joining his hands and taking a step closer to Monte Cristo, "I can tell you that you are my savior!
082.104 --You claim that you have been delivered from the prison?
082.105 -- Oh, that, in the name of Caderousse, Monsieur l'Abbé!
082.106 --Who?
082.107 -- An Englishman.
082.108 --What was his name?
082.109 --Lord Wilmore.
082.110 -- I know him; so I will know if you are lying.
082.111 --Mr. Abbot, I am telling the pure truth.
082.112 -- So this Englishman was protecting you?
082.113 --Not me, but a young Corsican who was my chain mate.
082.114 -- What was the name of this young Corsican?
082.115 --Benedetto.
082.116 --That is a baptismal name.
082.117 --He had no other, he was a foundling.
082.118 --So this young man escaped with you?
082.119 --Yes.
082.120 --How did that happen?
082.121 --We were working at Saint-Mandrier, near Toulon. Do you know Saint-Mandrier?
082.122 --I know it.
082.123 --Well, while we were sleeping, from noon to one o'clock....
082.124 --Slumbering convicts! Pity those guys," said the abbot.
082.125 --Dame!" said Caderousse, "we cannot always work, we are not dogs.
082.126 --Happy for the dogs, said Monte Cristo.
082.127 -While the others were having a siesta, we went away for a while, sawed off our irons with a file that the Englishman had sent us, and swam away.
082.128 -- And what became of this Benedetto?
082.129 -- I don't know.
082.130 -- You must know it, however.
082.131 -- No, in truth. We parted at Hyères."
082.132 And, to give more weight to his protest, Caderousse took another step toward the abbe, who remained motionless in his place, still calm and questioning.
082.133 "You lie!" said Abbé Busoni, with an accent of irresistible authority.
082.134 --Mr. Abbot!...
082.135 --You are lying! This man is still your friend, and you use him as an accomplice perhaps?
082.136 --Oh, Father!
082.137 --Since you left Toulon, how have you lived? Answer.
082.138 --As I could.
082.139 -- "You lie!" the abbot repeated a third time with an even more imperative accent.
082.140 Caderousse, terrified, looked at the Count.
082.141 "You have lived," said the latter, "on the money he gave you.
082.142 --Well, that's true," said Caderousse; "Benedetto has become the son of a great lord.
082.143 --How can he be the son of a great lord?
082.144 --Natural son.
082.145 --And what do you call this great lord?
082.146 --The Count of Monte Cristo, the one with whom we are staying.
082.147 --Benedetto, the son of the Count?
082.148 --Lady! one must believe, since the Count has found him a false father, since the Count gives him four thousand francs a month, since the Count leaves him five hundred thousand francs in his will.
082.149 --Ah! ah! said the false abbot, who was beginning to understand; and what name does this young man bear, in the meantime?
082.150 -- His name is Andrea Cavalcanti.
082.151 --So it is this young man whom my friend the Count of Monte Cristo receives at his house, and who is going to marry Miss Danglars?
082.152 -- Just so.
082.153 --And you suffer this, wretch! you who know his life and his blight?
082.154 --Why do you want me to prevent a comrade from succeeding? said Caderousse.
082.155 --That's right, it's not up to you to warn Mr. Danglars, it's up to me.
082.156 --Don't do that, Monsieur l'Abbé!
082.157 -- And why?
082.158 -- Because it is our bread that you would make us lose.
082.159 --And you think that, in order to save bread for wretches like you, I would become the perpetrator of their ruse, the accomplice of their crimes?
082.160 --Monsieur l'abbé! said Caderousse, coming closer still.
082.161 -- I will tell everything.
082.162 -- To whom?
082.163 -- To Mr. Danglars.
082.164 --Tron de l'air!" cried Caderousse, drawing a knife wide open from his vest, and striking the count in the middle of the chest, "you will say nothing, abbe!"
082.165 To Caderousse's great astonishment, the dagger, instead of penetrating the Count's chest, drew back bluntly.
082.166 At the same time the count seized the wrist of the assassin with his left hand, and twisted it with such force that the knife fell from his stiffened fingers and Caderousse uttered a cry of pain.
082.167 But the Count, without stopping at this cry, continued to twist the bandit's wrist until, with his arm dislocated, he fell first to his knees and then face down.
082.168 The Count rested his foot on his head and said:
082.169 "I don't know what's keeping me from breaking your skull, scoundrel!
082.170 --Ah! grace! grace!" shouted Caderousse.
082.171 The Count withdrew his foot.
082.172 "Get up!" he said.
082.173 Caderousse got up.
082.174 "Good heavens! what a wrist you have, Monsieur l'abbé!" said Caderousse, caressing his arm, all bruised by the pincers of flesh that had embraced it; "good heavens! what a wrist!
082.175 --Silence. God gives me the strength to tame a ferocious beast like you; it is in the name of this God that I act; remember that, wretch, and to spare you at this moment is still to serve the designs of God.
082.176 --Phew!" said Caderousse, all sore.
082.177 -Take this pen and paper and write down what I am going to dictate to you.
082.178 -- I don't know how to write, Father.
082.179 -You lie, take this quill and write!"
082.180 Caderousse, subjugated by this superior power, sat down and wrote:
082.181 "Sir, the man you are receiving at your house and to whom you are destining your daughter is a former convict escaped with me from the Toulon prison; he wore No. 59 and I wore No. 58.
082.182 "He was called Benedetto; but he himself does not know his real name, having never known his parents.
082.183 "Sign!" continued the Count.
082.184 --But do you want to lose me?
082.185 --If I wanted to lose you, you fool, I would drag you to the first guardhouse; besides, at the hour when the bill will be returned to its address, it is probable that you will have nothing more to fear; so sign."
082.186 Caderousse signed.
082.187 "The address: _To monsieur le baron Danglars, banquier, rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin_."
082.188 Caderousse wrote the address.
082.189 The abbe took the bill.
082.190 "Now," he said, "that's fine, go away.
082.191 --Where to?
082.192 --Where you came from.
082.193 --You want me to go out that window?
082.194 --You did get in.
082.195 --Are you planning something against me, Father?
082.196 -- You fool, what do you want me to think?
082.197 --Why don't you open the door for me?
082.198 --What's the use of waking the janitor?
082.199 --Mr. Abbot, tell me you don't want me dead.
082.200 -- I want what God wants.
082.201 --But swear to me that you will not strike me while I am coming down.
082.202 -- You fool and coward!
082.203 -- What do you want to do with me?
082.204 -- I ask you. I tried to make him a happy man, and I only made him a murderer!
082.205 --Mr. Abbot, said Caderousse, try one last test.
082.206 -So be it, said the Count. Listen, you know that I am a man of my word?
082.207 -- Yes, said Caderousse.
082.208 --If you return home safe and sound ....
082.209 --Unless it is you, what have I to fear?
082.210 --If you return home safe and sound, leave Paris, leave France, and wherever you are, as long as you behave honestly, I will give you a small pension; for if you return home safe and sound, well....
082.211 --Well?" asked Caderousse, shivering.
082.212 -- Well, I'll believe that God has forgiven you, and I'll forgive you too.
082.213 -- "True as I am a Christian," stammered Caderousse, recoiling, "you frighten me to death!
082.214 -- "Go away, go away!" said the Count, pointing with his finger to the window.
082.215 Caderousse, still badly reassured by this promise, stepped over the window and put his foot on the ladder.
082.216 There he stopped trembling.
082.217 "Now come down," said the abbot, crossing his arms.
082.218 Caderousse began to understand that there was nothing to fear on this side, and went down.
082.219 Then the Count approached with the candle, so that one could distinguish from the Champs-Élysées this man who was coming down from a window, lit by another man.
082.220 --What are you doing, Monsieur l'abbé?" said Caderousse; "if a patrol should pass by...."
082.221 And he blew out the candle. Then he continued to descend; but it was only when he felt the ground of the garden under his foot that he was sufficiently reassured.
082.222 Monte Cristo returned to his bedroom, and glancing quickly from the garden to the street, he saw Caderousse who, after having descended, made a detour into the garden and was going to plant his ladder at the end of the wall, in order to leave at another place than the one he had entered.
082.223 Then, passing from the garden to the street, he saw the man who seemed to be waiting running parallel to the street and placing himself behind the very corner near which Caderousse was about to descend.
082.224 Caderousse climbed slowly up the ladder, and, having reached the last rungs, put his head over the hood to make sure that the street was indeed lonely.
082.225 No one could be seen, no noise could be heard.
082.226 One o'clock struck at the Invalides.
082.227 Then Caderousse mounted on the stoop, and, pulling his ladder to him, passed it over the wall, then set about descending, or rather letting himself slide down the two uprights, a maneuver he performed with a skill that proved the habit he had of this exercise.
082.228 But, once launched on the slope, he could not stop. In vain he saw a man leaping into the shadows when he was halfway up; in vain he saw an arm rise up as he touched the ground; before he could defend himself, this arm struck him so furiously in the back that he dropped the ladder and shouted:
082.229 "Help!"
082.230 A second blow came to him almost immediately in the side, and he fell screaming:
082.231 "Murder!"
082.232 Finally, as he rolled on the ground, his adversary grabbed him by the hair and delivered a third blow to his chest.
082.233 This time Caderousse wanted to scream again, but he could only utter a groan, and let the three rivulets of blood that came from his three wounds flow out with a groan.
082.234 The assassin, seeing that he was no longer screaming, lifted his head by the hair; Caderousse had his eyes closed and his mouth twisted. The assassin thought he was dead, let his head fall back and disappeared.
082.235 Then Caderousse, sensing him moving away, straightened up on his elbow, and, with a dying voice, shouted in a supreme effort:
082.236 "To the assassin! I am dying! to me, Monsieur l'abbé, to me!"
082.237 This gloomy call pierced the shadow of the night. The door of the concealed staircase opened, then the little door to the garden, and Ali and his master came running with lights.
083.000 The hand of God.
083.001 Caderousse continued to shout in a lamentable voice:
083.002 "Mr. Abbot, help! help!
083.003 -- What is it?" asked Monte Cristo.
083.004 -- Help!" repeated Caderousse; "I have been murdered!
083.005 -- Here we are! Have courage!
083.006 --Ah! it is finished. You have arrived too late; you have arrived to see me die. What blows! What blood!"
083.007 And he faints.
083.008 Ali and his master took the wounded man and carried him to a room. There Monte Cristo signaled to Ali to undress him, and he recognized the three terrible wounds he had sustained.
083.009 "My God!" he said, "your vengeance is sometimes delayed; but I believe that then it only descends from heaven more completely."
083.010 Ali looked at his master as if to ask him what to do.
083.011 "Go and fetch Mr. King's Attorney Villefort, who lives in Faubourg Saint-Honoré, and bring him here. When you pass, you will wake up the concierge, and tell him to go and fetch a doctor."
083.012 Ali obeyed and left the false abbot alone with Caderousse, still fainting. When the unfortunate man reopened his eyes, the count, seated a few steps from him, was looking at him with a sombre expression of pity, and his lips, which were agitated, seemed to murmur a prayer.
083.013 "A surgeon, Monsieur l'abbé, a surgeon!" said Caderousse.
083.014 --We have gone to look for one," replied the abbot.
083.015 --I know very well that it is useless, as far as life is concerned, but he will be able to give me strength perhaps, and I want to have time to make my statement.
083.016 --On what?
083.017 -- About my murderer.
083.018 --So you know him?
083.019 --I do know him! Yes, I know him, it's Benedetto.
083.020 --That young Corsican?
083.021 --Himself.
083.022 --Your companion?
083.023 --Yes. After having given me the plan of the Count's house, hoping no doubt that I would kill him and thus become his heir, or that he would kill me and thus be rid of me, he waited for me in the street and murdered me.
083.024 --At the same time that I sent for the doctor, I sent for the king's attorney.
083.025 -- He will arrive too late, he will arrive too late, said Caderousse, I feel all my blood going away.
083.026 --Hold on," said Monte Cristo.
083.027 He went out and returned five minutes later with a bottle.
083.028 The eyes of the dying man, frighteningly fixed, had not in his absence left that door through which he instinctively guessed that help was coming.
083.029 "Hurry up! Mr. Abbot, hurry up! I feel that I am fainting again.
083.030 Monte Cristo approached and poured on the purple lips of the wounded man three or four drops of the liquor which the bottle contained.
083.031 Caderousse sighed.
083.032 "Oh," he said, "that's the life you're pouring into me; again... again....
083.033 --Two more drops would kill you, replied the abbot.
083.034 --Oh, let someone come to whom I can denounce the wretch.
083.035 -- Do you want me to write your statement?
083.036 --Yes... yes..." said Caderousse, whose eyes shone at the idea of this posthumous revenge.
083.037 Monte Cristo wrote:
083.038 "I die murdered by the Corsican Benedetto, my chain mate in Toulon under No. 59."
083.039 "Hurry up! Hurry up! said Caderousse, I could no longer sign."
083.040 Monte-Cristo presented the quill to Caderousse, who gathered his strength, signed, and fell back on his bed, saying:
083.041 "You will tell the rest, Monsieur l'abbé; you will say that he calls himself Andrea Cavalcanti, that he lodges at the Hotel des Princes, that.... Ah! ah! my God! my God! here I die!"
083.042 And Caderousse faints for the second time.
083.043 The abbot made him breathe in the odor of the bottle; the wounded man opened his eyes again.
083.044 His desire for vengeance had not left him while he was fainting.
083.045 "Ah, you will say all that, won't you, Father?
083.046 --All that, yes, and much more.
083.047 --What will you say?
083.048 -- I will say that he had probably given you the plan of this house in the hope that the Count would kill you. I will say that he had warned the Count by a bill; I will say that, the Count being absent, it was I who received this bill and who kept watch to wait for you.
083.049 --And he will be guillotined, will he not? said Caderousse, he will be guillotined, do you promise me that? I am dying with that hope, it will help me to die.
083.050 --I will say," continued the Count, "that he arrived behind you, that he watched you all the time; that when he saw you come out, he ran to the corner of the wall and hid himself.
083.051 --So you saw all this?
083.052 --Remember my words: "If you return home safe and sound, I will believe that God has forgiven you, and I will forgive you too."
083.053 --And you didn't warn me?" cried Caderousse, trying to raise himself on his elbow; "you knew I was going to be killed when I left here, and you didn't warn me!
083.054 --No, for in Benedetto's hand I saw the justice of God, and I would have thought I was committing a sacrilege by opposing the intentions of Providence.
083.055 - God's justice! Don't talk to me about it, Father: if there were God's justice, you know better than anyone that there are people who would be punished and who are not.
083.056 --Patience," said the abbot in a tone that made the dying man shudder, "patience!"
083.057 Caderousse looked at him in astonishment.
083.058 "And then," said the abbot, "God is full of mercy for all, as he was for you: he is a father before he is a judge.
083.059 --Ah, so you believe in God, do you?
083.060 - "If I had the misfortune not to have believed in it until now," said Monte Cristo, "I would believe in it when I saw you.
083.061 Caderousse raised his clenched fists to the sky.
083. 062 "Listen," said the abbot, extending his hand over the wounded man as if to command his faith, "this is what he has done for you, this God whom you refuse to recognize at your last moment: He had given you health, strength, secure work, friends even, life at last such as it must present itself to man to be sweet with the calm of conscience and the satisfaction of natural desires; instead of exploiting these gifts of the Lord, so rarely granted by him in their fullness, this is what you have done: you have given yourself over to idleness, to drunkenness, and in drunkenness you have betrayed one of your best friends.
083.063 --Help!" cried Caderousse, "I don't need a priest, I need a doctor; perhaps I am not mortally wounded, perhaps I am not going to die yet, perhaps I can be saved!
083.064 -You are so mortally wounded that, without the three drops of liquor I gave you just now, you would already have expired. Listen to me!
083.065 --Ah!" murmured Caderousse, "what a strange priest you are, who despairs of the dying instead of consoling them.
083. 066 -- Listen, continued the abbot: When you had betrayed your friend, God began, not to strike you, but to warn you; you fell into misery and went hungry; you had spent envying half a life that you could have spent acquiring, and already you were thinking of crime, giving yourself the excuse of necessity, when God performed a miracle for you, when God, through my hands, sent you into the bosom of your misery a fortune, brilliant for you, unhappy one, who had never possessed anything. But this unexpected, unhoped-for, unheard-of fortune is no longer enough for you from the moment you possess it, you want to double it: by what means? by murder. You double it, and then God snatches it away from you by bringing you before human justice.
083.067 -It was not I, said Caderousse, who wanted to kill the Jew, it was the Carconte.
083.068 -- Yes, said Monte Cristo. Also God always, I will not say just this time, for his justice would have given you death, but God, always merciful, allowed your judges to be touched by your words and let you live.
083.069 --God! to send me to prison for life: what a beautiful grace!
083.070 --This pardon, wretch! You looked upon it as a pardon when it was given to you; your cowardly heart, which trembled before death, leaped with joy at the announcement of a perpetual shame, for you said to yourself, like all the convicts: There is a door to the prison, there is no door to the grave. And you were right, for this door to the prison opened for you in an unexpected way: an Englishman visited Toulon, he had vowed to rescue two men from infamy: his choice fell on you and your companion; a second fortune came down for you from heaven, you found both money and peace, you could begin again to live the life of all men, you who had been condemned to live the life of convicts; then, wretch, you began to tempt God a third time. I have not enough, you say, when you had more than you ever had, and you commit a third crime, without reason, without excuse. God got tired. God has punished you."
083.071 Caderousse was getting weaker by the minute.
083.072 "Drink," he said; "I am thirsty... I am burning!"
083.073 Monte Cristo gave him a glass of water.
083.074 "Scoundrel Benedetto," said Caderousse, returning the glass: "he will escape, however!
083.075 --No one will escape, I tell you, Caderousse... Benedetto will be punished!
083.076 --Then you will be punished, too, said Caderousse; for you have not done your duty as a priest... you had to prevent Benedetto from killing me.
083.077 -Me! said the count with a smile which frightened the dying man, me to prevent Benedetto from killing you, at the moment when you had just broken your knife against the coat of mail which covered my chest!... Yes, perhaps if I had found you humble and repentant, I would have prevented Benedetto from killing you, but I found you proud and bloodthirsty, and I let the will of God be done!
083.078 --I don't believe in God!" shouted Caderousse, "you don't believe in God either... you lie... you lie!
083.079 -Shut up, said the abbot, for you are squeezing out of your body the last drops of your blood.... Ah, you don't believe in God, and you die struck by God! Ah! you don't believe in God, and God who however asks only a prayer, only a word, only a tear to forgive.... God who could direct the assassin's dagger in such a way that you would die on the spot.... God has given you a quarter of an hour to repent.... Go back to yourself, wretch, and repent!
083.080 --No, says Caderousse, no, I don't repent; there is no God, there is no Providence, there is only chance.
083.081 -- There is a Providence, there is a God, said Monte Cristo, and the proof is that you are lying there, despairing, denying God, and that I am standing before you, rich, happy, safe and sound, and joining my hands before God, in whom you try not to believe, and in whom, however, you believe in your heart.
083.082 --But who are you, then? asked Caderousse, fixing his dying eyes on the Count.
083.083 --Remember me well, said Monte Cristo, taking the candle and bringing it close to his face.
083.084 --Well, the abbot... the abbot Busoni...."
083.085 Monte Cristo took off the wig that disfigured him, and let down the beautiful black hair that framed his pale face so harmoniously.
083.086 "Oh!" said Caderousse in horror, "if it were not for this black hair, I would say that you are the Englishman, I would say that you are Lord Wilmore.
083.087 --I am neither the Abbé Busoni nor Lord Wilmore," said Monte Cristo: "look better, look further, look into your earliest memories."
083.088 There was in this word of the Count a magnetic vibration from which the exhausted senses of the wretch were revived one last time.
083.089 "Oh, indeed," he said, "it seems to me that I have seen you, that I once knew you.
083.090 --Yes, Caderousse, yes, you have seen me, yes, you have known me.
083.091 --But who are you, then? And if you have seen me, if you have known me, why are you letting me die?
083.092 --Because nothing can save you, Caderousse, because your wounds are mortal. If you could have been saved, I would have seen in that a last mercy from the Lord, and I would still have tried, I swear to you by my father's grave, to restore you to life and to repentance.
083.093 --Per the tomb of your father!" said Caderousse, revived by a supreme spark and rising to see more closely the man who had just given him that oath sacred to all men: "Eh! who are you then?"
083.094 The Count had not ceased to follow the progress of the agony. He understood that this burst of life was the last; he approached the dying man, and covering him with a look that was calm and sad at the same time:
083.095 "I am... he said in his ear, I am...."
083.096 And his lips, hardly opened, gave way to a name pronounced so low, that the count seemed afraid to hear it himself.
083.097 Caderousse, who had raised himself on his knees, stretched out his arms, made an effort to draw back, then joining his hands and raising them with a supreme effort:
083.098 "O my God, my God," he said, "pardon me for denying you; you do exist, you are indeed the father of men in heaven and the judge of men on earth. My God, Lord, I have long disregarded you! my God, Lord, forgive me! my God, Lord, receive me!"
083.099 And Caderousse, closing his eyes, fell backward with a last cry and with a last sigh.
083.100 The blood stopped at once at the lips of his wide wounds.
083.101 He was dead.
083.102 "_Un_!" said the Count mysteriously, his eyes fixed on the corpse already disfigured by this horrible death.
083.103 Ten minutes later the doctor and the king's prosecutor arrived, brought, the one by the concierge, the other by Ali, and were received by the Abbot Busoni, who was praying near the dead man.
084.000 Beauchamp.
084.001 For a fortnight there was nothing but talk in Paris of this attempted robbery so audaciously carried out at the Count's house. The dying man had signed a declaration which indicated Benedetto as his murderer. The police were asked to send all their agents after the murderer.
084.002 Caderousse's knife, the mute lantern, the bunch of keys and the clothes, minus the vest, which could not be found, were deposited in the clerk's office; the body was taken to the morgue.
084.003 To everyone the Count replied that this adventure had taken place while he was at his house in Auteuil, and that he therefore only knew what he had been told by the Abbé Busoni, who that evening, by the greatest chance, had asked him to spend the night at his house in order to research some of the precious books in his library.
084.004 Bertuccio alone paled every time the name Benedetto was pronounced in his presence, but there was no reason for anyone to notice Bertuccio's paleness.
084.005 Villefort, called upon to establish the crime, had claimed the case and conducted the investigation with that passionate ardor which he put into all criminal cases where he was called upon to speak.
084.006 But three weeks had already passed without the most active investigations having brought any result, and people were beginning to forget in the world the attempted robbery at the Count's house and the murder of the robber by his accomplice, in order to occupy themselves with the forthcoming marriage of Miss Danglars to Count Andrea Cavalcanti.
084.007 This marriage was more or less declared, the young man was received at the banker's as fiancé.
084.008 One had written to Mr. Cavalcanti father, who had strongly approved the marriage, and who, by expressing all his regrets of what his service prevented him absolutely from leaving Parma where he was, declared to agree to give the capital of one hundred and fifty thousand livres of pension.
084.009 It was agreed that the three million would be placed at Danglars, who would make them worth; some people had well tried to give to the young man doubts on the solidity of the position of his future father-in-law who, for some time, had experienced repeated losses at the Stock Exchange; but the young man, with a disinterestedness and a sublime confidence, pushed back all these vain remarks, of which he had the delicacy to not say a single word to the baron.
084.010 Also the baron adored the count Andrea Cavalcanti.
084.011 The same was not true of Miss Eugenie Danglars. In her instinctive hatred of marriage, she had welcomed Andrea as a means of keeping Morcerf away; but now that Andrea was getting too close, she was beginning to feel a visible repulsion for Andrea.
084.012 Perhaps the baron had noticed it; but as he could only attribute this repulsion to a caprice, he had pretended not to notice it.
084.013 However, the delay requested by Beauchamp was almost over. Besides, Morcerf had been able to appreciate the value of Monte Cristo's advice, when the latter had told him to let things drop by themselves; no one had picked up the note about the general, and no one had dared to recognize in the officer who had delivered the castle of Janina the noble count sitting in the Chamber of Peers.
084.014 Albert was no less insulted, for the intention of the offense was certainly in the few lines that had wounded him. Moreover, the way in which Beauchamp had ended the conference had left a bitter memory in his heart. He thus caressed in his mind the idea of this duel, of which he hoped, if Beauchamp was willing to lend himself to it, to steal the real cause even from his witnesses.
084.015 As for Beauchamp, he had not been seen since the day of Albert's visit to him; and to all who asked, he was said to be away on a trip of some days.
084.016 Where was he?
084.017 One morning Albert was awakened by his valet, who announced Beauchamp.
084.018 Albert rubbed his eyes, ordered that Beauchamp be made to wait in the small smoking room on the first floor, dressed quickly, and went downstairs.
084.019 He found Beauchamp walking up and down; on seeing him, Beauchamp stopped.
084.020 "The step you are taking in coming to my house by yourself, and without waiting for the visit I intended to make to you today, seems to me a good omen, sir," said Albert. Let us see, say quickly, should I hold out my hand to you and say, "Beauchamp, confess a wrong and keep me a friend?" or should I simply ask you, "What are your weapons?"
084.021 --Albert, said Beauchamp with a sadness that struck the young man with amazement, let us sit down first, and talk.
084.022 --But it seems to me, on the contrary, sir, that before we sit down, you have to answer me?
084.023 --Albert, said the journalist, there are circumstances where the difficulty lies precisely in the answer.
084.024 -- I will make it easy for you, sir, by repeating the request: Do you want to retract your statement, yes or no?
084.025 --Morcerf, one is not satisfied with answering yes or no to questions which concern the honor, the social position, the life of a man like M. the Lieutenant General Count de Morcerf, peer of France.
084.026 -- What is done then?
084. 027 -- One does what I did, Albert; one says: Money, time and fatigue are nothing when it is a question of the reputation and interests of a whole family; one says: It takes more than probabilities, it takes certainties to accept a duel to the death with a friend; one says: If I cross the sword, or if I drop the trigger of a pistol on a man whose hand I have, for three years, shaken, I must at least know why I am doing such a thing, so that I arrive on the field with my heart at rest and that tranquil conscience which a man needs when his arm must save his life.
084.028 --Well, well," asked Morcerf impatiently, "what does that mean?
084.029 --It means that I am coming from Janina.
084.030 --From Janina? You!
084.031 --Yes, me.
084.032 --Impossible.
084.033 --My dear Albert, here is my passport; see the visas: Geneva, Milan, Venice, Trieste, Delvino, Janina. Will you believe the police of a republic, a kingdom and an empire?"
084.034 Albert cast his eyes on the passport, and raised them, astonished, on Beauchamp.
084.035 "You have been to Janina?" he said.
084.036 --Albert, if you had been a stranger, an unknown, a simple lord like that Englishman who came to ask me for reason three or four months ago, and whom I killed to get rid of him, you understand that I would not have taken such pains; but I thought I owed you this mark of consideration. It took me eight days to go, eight days to return, plus four days of quarantine, and forty-eight hours of stay, that makes my three weeks. I arrived this night, and here I am.
084.037 --My God, my God! What circumlocutions, Beauchamp, and how long you delay in telling me what I expect from you!
084.038 --The truth is, Albert....
084.039 --You seem to hesitate.
084.040 --Yes, I'm afraid.
084.041 --You are afraid to admit that your correspondent had deceived you? Oh, don't worry about yourself, Beauchamp; admit it, Beauchamp, your courage cannot be doubted.
084.042 --Oh, it is not that, murmured the journalist; on the contrary...."
084.043 Albert paled horribly: he tried to speak, but the word expired on his lips.
084.044 "My friend," said Beauchamp in the most affectionate tone, "believe that I would be happy to apologize to you, and that I would apologize to you with all my heart; but alas....
084.045 --But what?
084.046 --The note was right, my friend.
084.047 --How! that French officer....
084.048 --Yes.
084.049 --That Fernand?
084.050 --Yes.
084.051 --This traitor who delivered the castles of the man in whose service he was....
084.052 --Pardon me for telling you what I tell you, my friend: this man is your father!"
084.053 Albert made a furious movement to rush at Beauchamp; but the latter held him back much more with a gentle look than with his outstretched hand.
084.054 "Here, my friend," he said, drawing a paper from his pocket, "here is the proof."
084.055 Albert opened the paper; it was an attestation of four notable inhabitants of Janina, stating that Colonel Fernand Mondego, a colonel instructor in the service of the vizier Ali-Tebelin, had delivered the castle of Janina for two thousand purses.
084.056 The signatures were legalized by the consul.
084.057 Albert staggered and fell into a chair.
084.058 There was no need to doubt it this time, the family name was written in full.
084.059 Also, after a moment of silent and painful silence, his heart swelled, the veins in his neck swelled, a torrent of tears gushed from his eyes.
084.060 Beauchamp, who had looked with deep pity at this young man giving way to the paroxysm of pain, approached him.
084.061 "Albert," he said, "you understand me now, don't you? I wanted to see everything, to judge everything for myself, hoping that the explanation would be favorable to your father, and that I could do him justice. But on the contrary, the information I have obtained shows that this instructor, that Fernand Mondego, raised by Ali-Pacha to the title of general governor, is none other than Count Fernand de Morcerf: so I came back remembering the honor you had done me of admitting me to your friendship, and I ran to you."
084.062 Albert, still stretched out on his armchair, held both his hands over his eyes, as if he wanted to prevent the day from reaching him.
084.063 "I have come to you," Beauchamp continued, "to tell you: Albert, the faults of our fathers, in these times of action and reaction, cannot reach the children. Albert, very few have passed through these revolutions in the midst of which we were born, without some stain of mud or blood having stained their soldier's uniform or their judge's robe. Albert, no one in the world, now that I have all the proof, now that I am master of your secret, can force me to a fight that your conscience, I am sure, would reproach you with as a crime; but what you can no longer demand of me, I have come to offer you. These proofs, these revelations, these attestations that I alone possess, do you want them to disappear? Do you want this terrible secret to remain between you and me? Entrusted to my word of honor, it will never leave my mouth; say, will you, Albert? say, will you, my friend?"
084.064 Albert sprang at Beauchamp's neck.
084.065 "Ah, noble heart!" he cried.
084.066 --Here," said Beauchamp, presenting the papers to Albert.
084.067 Albert seized them with a convulsive hand, embraced them, crumpled them, thought of tearing them up; but, trembling that the smallest parcel removed by the wind would not one day come back to hit him in the forehead, he went to the candle still lit for the cigars and consumed every last fragment of them.
084.068 "Dear friend, excellent friend!" murmured Albert while burning the papers.
084.069 --Let all this be forgotten like a bad dream," said Beauchamp, "let it fade away like these last sparks that run over the blackened paper, let it all vanish like this last smoke that escapes from these mute ashes.
084.070 --Yes, yes," said Albert, "and let nothing remain of it but the eternal friendship that I vow to my savior, a friendship that my children will transmit to yours, a friendship that will always remind me that the blood of my veins, the life of my body, the honor of my name, I owe to you; for if such a thing had been known, oh! Beauchamp, I declare to you, I would have burned my brain, or not, poor mother! for I would not have wanted to kill her at the same time, or I would have expatriated myself.
084.071 --Dear Albert!" said Beauchamp.
084.072 But the young man soon came out of this unexpected and, as it were, artificial joy, and fell back more deeply into his sadness.
084.073 "Well," asked Beauchamp, "what is it now?
084.074 --It is, said Albert, that I have something broken in my heart. Listen, Beauchamp, one does not part like this in a second from that respect, that confidence and that pride which the unblemished name of his father inspires in a son. Oh, Beauchamp, Beauchamp! how shall I now approach mine? Shall I draw back my forehead from his lips, my hand from his hand? Here, Beauchamp, I am the most unhappy of men. Ah, my mother, my poor mother," said Albert, looking through eyes drowned in tears at the portrait of his mother, "if you knew that, how you must have suffered!
084.075 --Let us see," said Beauchamp, taking his two hands; "courage, friend!
084.076 --But where did that first note in your newspaper come from? exclaimed Albert; there is behind it all an unknown hatred, an invisible enemy.
084.077 --Well, said Beauchamp, all the more reason. Courage, Albert! no trace of emotion on your face; carry this pain within you as the cloud carries within itself ruin and death, a fatal secret which one understands only at the moment when the storm breaks. Go, friend, save your strength for the moment when the storm breaks.
084.078 --Oh, but do you think we are not at the end?
084.079 --Myself, I do not believe anything, my friend; but finally all is possible. By the way....
084.080 --What?" asked Albert, seeing that Beauchamp was hesitating.
084.081 -- Are you still married to Miss Danglars?
084.082 --What are you asking me that about at a time like this, Beauchamp?
084.083 --Because, in my mind, the breaking up or the fulfillment of this marriage is connected with the object which occupies us at this moment.
084.084 --How! said Albert, whose forehead became inflamed, you believe that Mr. Danglars....
084.085 --I am only asking you where your marriage stands. What the hell! do not see in my words anything other than what I want to put in them, and do not give them more significance than they have!
084.086 -- No, said Albert, the marriage is broken off.
084.087 --Good," said Beauchamp.
084.088 Then, seeing that the young man was about to fall back into his melancholy
084.089 "Here, Albert," he said to him, "if you believe me, we'll go out; a ride in the woods in a phaeton or on horseback will distract you; then we'll come back and have lunch somewhere, and you'll go to your business and I'll go to mine.
084.090 -- I'd love to," said Albert, "but let's go out on foot; it seems to me that a little fatigue would do me good.
084.091 --So be it," said Beauchamp.
084.092 And the two friends, leaving on foot, followed the boulevard. They arrived at the Madeleine:
084.093 "Here," said Beauchamp, "since we are on the road, let's go and see M. de Monte-Cristo for a while; he will distract you; he is an admirable man for putting minds to rest, in that he never asks questions; yet, in my opinion, people who do not ask questions are the most skilful consolers.
084.094 --So, says Albert, let's go to his place, I love him."
085.000 The journey.
085.001 Monte-Cristo gave a cry of joy at seeing the two young people together.
085.002 "Ah! ah!" he said. Well, I hope that everything is finished, cleared up, arranged?
085.003 --Yes," said Beauchamp, "absurd noises which have fallen of their own accord, and which now, if they were renewed, would have me for their first antagonist. So let's not talk about that anymore.
085.004 --Albert will tell you," said the Count, "that this is the advice I gave him. Here," he added, "you see me finishing the most miserable morning I have ever spent, I believe.
085.005 --What are you doing?" said Albert, "putting your papers in order, I believe?
085.006 --In my papers, thank God not! My papers are always in marvelous order, since I have no papers, but Mr. Cavalcanti's papers.
085.007 --From Mr. Cavalcanti? asked Beauchamp.
085.008 --Yes, don't you know that it is a young man that the Count is throwing? said Morcerf.
085.009 --No, let us be clear," replied Monte Cristo, "I do not throw anyone, and M. Cavalcanti less than any other.
085.010 --And who is going to marry Miss Danglars in my place; which," continued Albert, trying to smile, "as you can well imagine, my dear Beauchamp, affects me cruelly.
085.011 --How! Cavalcanti is marrying Miss Danglars?" asked Beauchamp.
085.012 --Ah, but you come from the end of the world? said Monte-Cristo; you, a journalist, the husband of Renommée! All Paris speaks only of that.
085.013 --And it was you, Count, who made this marriage?
085.014 --Me? Oh, silence, Mr. Newspaperman, don't go saying such things! Me, for God's sake, make a marriage? No, you don't know me; on the contrary, I opposed it with all my might, I refused to make the request.
085.015 --Ah, I understand, said Beauchamp: because of our friend Albert?
085.016 -- Because of me, said the young man; oh, no, by my faith! The Count will do me the justice to attest that I have always begged him, on the contrary, to break off this project, which fortunately is broken off. The Count claims that it is not he whom I must thank; so be it, I will raise, like the ancients, an altar _Deo ignoto_.
085.017 --Listen, said Monte-Cristo, it is so little me, that I am at odds with the father-in-law and with the young man; there is only Mlle. Eugenie, who does not seem to me to have a deep vocation for marriage, who, seeing how little I was disposed to make her give up her dear freedom, has retained her affection for me.
085.018 --And you say that this marriage is about to take place?
085.019 -- Oh, my God, yes, in spite of everything I have said. I don't know the young man, he is said to be rich and of good family, but for me these things are mere "they say". I have repeated all this to satiety to M. Danglars; but he is infatuated with his Lucquois. I went so far as to tell him of a circumstance which, for me, was more serious: the young man was changed into a nurse, kidnapped by Bohemians or led astray by his tutor, I don't really know. But what I do know is that his father has lost sight of him for more than ten years; what he did during these ten years of wandering life, God only knows. Well, none of this helped. I was asked to write to the major, to ask him for papers; these papers, here they are. I send them to them, but, like Pilate, by washing my hands.
085.020 -- And Miss d'Armilly," asked Beauchamp, "how does she look to you, who are taking her pupil away from her?
085.021 --Dame! I don't really know: but it seems that she is leaving for Italy. Mrs. Danglars spoke to me about her and asked me for letters of recommendation for the impresarii; I gave her a note for the director of the Valle theater, who has some obligations to me. But what's the matter with you, Albert? You look very sad; are you in love with Miss Danglars, for example, without suspecting it?
085.022 -Not that I know of," said Albert, smiling sadly.
085.023 Beauchamp began to look at the paintings.
085.024 "But in the end," continued Monte Cristo, "you are not in your ordinary state. Let's see, what do you have?
085.025 -- I have a headache, said Albert.
085.026 -- Well, my dear viscount, said Monte Cristo, I have in this case an infallible remedy to propose to you, a remedy which has succeeded for me each time I have experienced some annoyance.
085.027 -What is it?" asked the young man.
085.028 --The move.
085.029 --Really? said Albert.
085.030 --Yes; and look, since I am excessively upset at the moment, I am moving. Do you want us to move together?
085.031 --You are upset, Count! said Beauchamp, and of what?
085.032 --Goddamn it, you talk about it at your ease; I'd like to see you with an investigation going on in your house!
085.033 --Instruction! What instruction?
085.034 -- The one that M. de Villefort is drawing up against my amiable assassin, a sort of brigand who has escaped from the penal colony, so it seems.
085.035 --Ah, it's true," said Beauchamp, "I read about it in the papers. What is this Caderousse?
085.036 --Well, it seems that he is a Provençal. M. de Villefort heard of him when he was in Marseille, and M. Danglars remembers having seen him. The result is that the king's prosecutor takes the affair very much to heart, that it has, it seems, interested the prefect of police to the highest degree, and that, thanks to this interest, for which I could not be more grateful, I have been sent here for the last fifteen days all the bandits that can be obtained in Paris and the suburbs, under the pretext that they are the assassins of M. Caderousse. Caderousse; from which it follows that, in three months, if this continues, there will not be a thief or an assassin in this beautiful kingdom of France who does not know the plan of my house on the tip of his finger; so I am taking the decision to abandon it entirely to them, and to go as far away as the earth will carry me. Come with me, viscount, I will take you.
085.037 -- Gladly.
085.038 --Then it's agreed?
085.039 -- Yes, but where?
085.040 --I told you, where the air is pure, where noise is deadening, where, however proud one may be, one feels humble and small. I like this abasement, me, who is said to be master of the universe like Augustus.
085.041 -- Where are you going, finally?
085.042 -- To the sea, viscount, to the sea. I am a sailor, you see, as a child, I was cradled in the arms of the old Ocean and on the bosom of the beautiful Amphitrite; I played with the green mantle of the one and the azure dress of the other; I love the sea as one loves a mistress, and when it has been a long time since I saw her, I miss her.
085.043 --Come on, Count, come on!
085.044 -- To the sea?
085.045 -- Yes.
085.046 -- Do you accept?
085.047 -- I accept.
085.048 -- Well, Viscount, this evening there will be a travel briska in my courtyard, in which one can lie down as if in bed; this briska will be harnessed to four post horses. Mr. Beauchamp, it is very easy to fit four horses. Would you like to come with us? I'll take you!
085.049 --Thank you, I'm from the sea.
085.050 --What? You're from the sea?
085.051 -- Yes, or thereabouts. I have just made a short trip to the Borromean Islands.
085.052 --What does it matter! Come along, said Albert.
085.053 -- No, dear Morcerf, you must understand that from the moment I refuse, the thing is impossible. Besides, it is important," he added, lowering his voice, "that I remain in Paris, if only to watch over the newspaper box.
085.054 --Ah! you are a good and excellent friend, said Albert; yes, you are right, keep watch, watch, Beauchamp, and try to discover the enemy to whom this revelation owed the day."
085.055 Albert and Beauchamp parted: their last handshake contained all the meanings that their lips could not express before a stranger.
085.056 "Excellent boy, Beauchamp!" said Monte Cristo after the journalist had left; "isn't that so, Albert?
085.057 --Oh, yes, a man of heart, I can vouch for that; so I love him with all my soul. But, now that we are alone, although I don't care, where are we going?
085.058 -- To Normandy, if you please.
085.059 -- Wonderful. We are quite in the country, aren't we? No society, no neighbors?
085.060 -- We are head to head with horses to run, dogs to hunt, and a boat to fish, that is all.
085.061 --That's what I need; I'll tell my mother, and I'm at your orders.
085.062 --But, said Monte Cristo, will I allow you?
085.063 --What?
085.064 -To come to Normandy.
085.065 -- To me? Am I not free?
085.066 --To go where you want, alone, I know that, since I met you escaped through Italy.
085.067 --Well?
085.068 --But to come with the man they call the Count of Monte Cristo?
085.069 -- You have a short memory, Count.
085.070 --How so?
085.071 --Have I not told you how much sympathy my mother had for you?
085.072 --Woman often varies, said Francis I; woman is the wave, said Shakespeare; one was a great king and the other a great poet, and each of them must have known woman.
085.073 --Yes, the woman; but my mother is not the woman, she is a woman.
085.074 --Do you allow a poor foreigner not to understand perfectly all the subtleties of your language?
085.075 --I mean that my mother is stingy with her feelings, but that once she has given them, it is forever.
085.076 --Ah, really," said Monte Cristo, sighing; "and do you think she does me the honor of granting me any feeling but the most perfect indifference?
085.077 -- Listen! I have already told you and I repeat it," said Morcerf, "you must really be a very strange and superior man.
085.078 --Oh!
085.079 -- Yes, for my mother has been taken in, I will not say by curiosity, but by the interest you inspire. When we are alone, we talk only about you.
085.080 --And she told you to beware of this Manfred?
085.081 --On the contrary, she said to me: "Morcerf, I believe the Count to be a noble nature; try to make yourself loved by him."
085.082 Monte-Cristo turned his eyes away and sighed.
085.083 "Oh, really?" he said.
085.084 -So, you understand," continued Albert, "that instead of opposing my trip, she will approve it with all her heart, since it fits in with the recommendations she makes to me every day.
085.085 - Go, then, said Monte Cristo; see you tonight. Be here at five o'clock; we shall arrive there at midnight or one o'clock.
085.086 --How! at Le Tréport?...
085.087 --At Le Tréport or thereabouts.
085.088 --It only takes you eight hours to travel forty-eight leagues?
085.089 --That's still a lot, said Monte Cristo.
085.090 --Decidedly you are the man of prodigies, and you will manage not only to surpass the railroads, which is not very difficult in France especially, but also to go faster than the telegraph.
085.091 -- In the meantime, Viscount, as it always takes us seven or eight hours to get there, be exact.
085.092 -- Don't worry, I have nothing to do until then but get ready.
085.093 -- At five o'clock, then?
085.094 -- At five o'clock."
085.095 Albert went out. I am not sure that I am going to be able to do that, but I am sure that I will be able to do it. Finally, passing his hand over his forehead, as if to dismiss his reverie, he went to the bell and struck it twice.
085.096 At the sound of Monte Cristo's two knocks on the bell, Bertuccio entered.
085.097 "Master Bertuccio," he said, "it is not tomorrow, it is not the day after tomorrow, as I thought at first, it is tonight that I am leaving for Normandy; by five o'clock, that is more time than you need; you will send word to the grooms of the first relay; M. de Morcerf will accompany me. Go!"
085.098 Bertuccio obeyed, and a pikeman ran to Pontoise to announce that the post-chair would pass at six o'clock sharp. The groom at Pontoise sent an express to the next relay, who sent another; and, six hours later, all the relays laid out on the road were warned.
085.099 Before leaving, the Count went up to Haydée's house, announced his departure, told her where he was going, and put all his household at her orders.
085.100 Albert was exact. The journey, gloomy at its beginning, was soon cleared up by the physical effect of speed. Morcerf had no idea of such speed.
085.101 "Indeed," said Monte Cristo, "with your post making its two leagues an hour, with that stupid law which forbids one traveler to overtake another without asking permission, and which makes it the right of a sick or quintet traveler to chain in his wake travelers who are cheerful and in good health, there is no possible locomotion; I avoid this inconvenience by traveling with my own postillion and my own horses, don't I, Ali?"
085.102 And the Count, putting his head through the door, gave a little cry of excitement that gave the horses wings; they no longer ran, they flew. The carriage rolled like thunder over the royal pavement, and everyone turned away to see this flaming meteor pass. Ali, repeating this cry, smiled, showing his white teeth, clutching in his strong hands the foaming reins, spurring the horses, whose beautiful manes scattered in the wind; Ali, the child of the desert, found himself in his element, and with his black face, his burning eyes, his snowy burnous, he seemed, in the midst of the dust he raised, the genius of the simoun and the god of the hurricane.
085.103 "Here," said Morcerf, "is a pleasure I did not know, it is the pleasure of speed."
085.104 And the last clouds on his forehead were dissipating, as if the air he was splitting were taking those clouds with him.
085.105 "But where on earth do you find such horses?" asked Albert. Do you have them made on purpose?
085.106 -- Just so, said the Count. Six years ago I found in Hungary a famous stallion renowned for his speed; I bought him for I don't know how much: it was Bertuccio who paid. In the same year, he had thirty-two children. It is all these offspring of the same father that we are going to review; they are all the same, black, without a single spot, except for a star on the forehead, because to this privileged stud they have chosen mares, as to pashas they choose favorites.
085.107 --That is admirable!... But tell me, Count, what do you do with all these horses?
085.108 --As you can see, I travel with them.
085.109 --But you won't be traveling forever?
085.110 -- When I no longer need them, Bertuccio will sell them, and he claims that he will earn thirty or forty thousand francs on them.
085.111 --But there will be no king of Europe rich enough to buy them from you.
085.112 --So he will sell them to some simple vizier from the East, who will empty his treasury to pay for them and who will fill his treasury by administering blows with sticks under the soles of his subjects' feet.
085.113 --Count, do you want me to communicate a thought that came to me?
085.114 --Do it.
085.115 --That after you, Mr. Bertuccio must be the richest private individual in Europe.
085.116 -- Well, you are mistaken, Viscount. I am sure that if you turned over Bertuccio's pockets, you would not find a dime worth of money.
085.117 --Why is that?" asked the young man. Is Mr. Bertuccio a phenomenon? Ah, my dear Count, don't push me too far into the marvelous, or I won't believe you anymore, I warn you.
085.118 -- Never marvelous with me, Albert; figures and reason, that is all. Now, listen to this dilemma: A steward steals, but why does he steal?
085.119 --Damn! because it is in his nature, it seems to me, says Albert, he steals to steal.
085.120 --Well, no, you are mistaken: he steals because he has a wife, children, ambitious desires for himself and his family; he steals above all because he is not sure of never leaving his master and he wants to make a future for himself. Well, Mr. Bertuccio is alone in the world, he draws from my purse without accounting to me, he is sure never to leave me.
085.121 --Why is that?
085.122 --Because I couldn't find a better one.
085.123 --You're going around in a vicious circle, the circle of probabilities.
085.124 -- No, I'm not; I'm in the certainties. The good servant for me is the one over whom I have the right of life or death.
085.125 --And you have the right of life or death over Bertuccio? asked Albert.
085.126 --Yes," replied the Count coldly.
085.127 There are words that close a conversation like an iron door. The Count's "yes" was one of those words.
085.128 The rest of the journey was accomplished with the same rapidity; the thirty-two horses, divided into eight relays, made their forty-eight leagues in eight hours.
085.129 They arrived in the middle of the night at the gate of a beautiful park. The janitor was standing and holding the gate open. He had been warned by the groom of the last relay.
085.130 It was half past two in the morning. Morcerf was led to his apartment. He found a bath and supper ready. The servant, who had been on the back seat of the carriage, was at his orders; Baptistin, who had been on the front seat, was at the Count's.
085.131 Albert took his bath, supped and went to bed. All night long he was lulled by the melancholy sound of the swell. When he got up, he went straight to the window, opened it and found himself on a small terrace, where one had before him the sea, that is to say the immensity, and behind him a pretty park overlooking a small forest.
085. 132 In a cove of a certain size, a small corvette with a narrow hull, a slender mast, and carrying on the horn a flag with the arms of Monte Cristo, arms representing a golden mountain posing on an azure sea, with a cross of gules in the chief, which could just as well be an allusion to his name recalling Calvary, which the passion of Our Lord has made a mountain more precious than gold, and the infamous cross which his divine blood has made holy, as to some personal memory of suffering and regeneration buried in the night of this man's mysterious past. Around the schooner were several small tugboats belonging to the fishermen of the neighboring villages, and which seemed like humble subjects awaiting the orders of their queen.
085.133 There, as in all the places where Monte Cristo stopped, even if only to spend two days, life was organized with the thermometer of the highest comfort; also life, at the moment, became easy there.
085.134 Albert found in his anteroom two rifles and all the utensils necessary to a hunter; a room higher up, and placed on the first floor, was devoted to all the ingenious machines which the English, great fishermen, because they are patient and idle, have not yet been able to make the routine fishermen of France adopt.
085.135 The whole day was spent in these various exercises at which, moreover, Monte Cristo excelled: a dozen pheasants were killed in the park, as many trout were caught in the streams, dinner was served in a kiosk overlooking the sea, and tea was served in the library.
085. 136 Towards the evening of the third day, Albert, broken with fatigue from the wear and tear of this life which seemed to be a game for Monte Cristo, was sleeping near the window while the Count was making with his architect the plan of a greenhouse which he wanted to establish in his house, when the sound of a horse crushing the stones of the road made the young man raise his head; He looked out of the window and, with the most unpleasant surprise, saw in the courtyard his valet, whom he had not wanted to follow him in order to embarrass Monte Cristo less.
085.137 "Florentine here!" he cried, leaping into his chair; "is my mother ill?"
085.138 And he rushed to the door of the room.
085.139 Monte Cristo followed him with his eyes, and saw him approach the valet who, still out of breath, drew from his pocket a small sealed packet. The small package contained a newspaper and a letter.
085.140 "From whom is this letter?" asked Albert sharply.
085.141 --From Mr. Beauchamp," answered Florentin.
085.142 -Was it Beauchamp who sent you then?
085.143 -- Yes, sir. He sent for me at his house, gave me the money necessary for my journey, sent for a post horse, and made me promise not to stop until I had joined him: I made the journey in fifteen hours."
085.144 Albert opened the letter with a shudder: at the first lines he uttered a cry, and seized the paper with a visible tremor.
085.145 Suddenly his eyes darkened, his legs seemed to give way under him, and, ready to fall, he leaned on Florentin, who extended his arm to support him.
085.146 "Poor young man!" murmured Monte Cristo, so low that he himself could not have heard the sound of the words of compassion he was uttering; "it is said, then, that the fault of the fathers will fall upon the children to the third and fourth generation."
085.147 Meanwhile Albert had regained his strength, and, continuing to read, shook his hair off his sweaty head, and, crumpling up letter and newspaper:
085.148 "Florentin," he said, "is your horse in a condition to take the road to Paris again?
085.149 --This is a bad, hobbled post bidet.
085.150 --Oh, my God! And how was the house when you left it?
085.151 - Quite calm; but when I came back from Mr. Beauchamp's, I found Madame in tears; she had asked me to know when you would be back. So I told her that I was going to look for you on behalf of Mr. Beauchamp. Her first movement was to stretch out her arm as if to stop me; but after a moment's thought:
085.152 "Yes, go, Florentin," she said, "and let him come back."
085.153 --Yes, my mother, yes, said Albert, I am coming back, be quiet, and woe to the infamous one!... But, first of all, I must leave."
085.154 He went back to the room where he had left Monte Cristo.
085.155 He was no longer the same man, and five minutes had sufficed to effect a sad metamorphosis in Albert; he had gone out in his ordinary state, he returned with his voice altered, his face furrowed with feverish blushes, his eye sparkling under blue-veined eyelids, and his gait staggering like that of a drunken man.
085.156 "Count," he said, "thank you for your good hospitality, which I would have liked to enjoy longer, but I must return to Paris.
085.157 -- What has happened?
085.158 --A great misfortune; but allow me to leave, it is a matter of something far more precious than my life. No questions, Count, I beg you, but a horse!
085.159 "My stables are at your service, Viscount," said Monte Cristo; "but you will kill yourself with fatigue by running the post office on horseback; take a carriage, a coupé, some car.
085.160 --No, that would be too long, and then I need this fatigue that you fear for me, it will do me good."
085.161 Albert took a few steps, spinning around like a man hit by a bullet, and went to fall on a chair near the door.
085.162 Monte Cristo did not see this second weakness, he was at the window and shouting:
085.163 "Ali, a horse for M. de Morcerf! let them hasten! he is in a hurry!"
085.164 These words restored Albert to life; he dashed out of the room, the count followed him.
085.165 "Thank you!" murmured the young man as he sprang into the saddle. You will return as soon as you can, Florentine. Is there a word of command to give me horses?
085.166 -No other than to return the one you are riding; they will saddle you with another one at once."
085.167 Albert was about to start, he stopped.
085.168 "You may find my departure strange, foolish," said the young man. You don't understand how a few lines written on a newspaper can put a man in despair; well," he added, throwing the newspaper at him, "read this, but only when I have gone, so that you won't see my blush."
085.169 And as the Count picked up the newspaper, he thrust the spurs, which had just been tied to his boots, into the belly of the horse, which, astonished that there was a rider who thought he needed vis-à-vis him such a stimulant, took off like a crossbow bolt.
085.170 The Count followed the young man with a feeling of infinite compassion, and it was not until he had completely disappeared that, returning his gaze to the newspaper, he read the following:
085.171 "This French officer in the service of Ali, pasha of Janina, of whom three weeks ago the newspaper _L'Impartial_ spoke, and who not only delivered up the castles of Janina, but also sold his benefactor to the Turks, was indeed at that time called Fernand, as our honorable colleague has said; but since then he has added to his Christian name a title of nobility and a land name.
085.172 "He is now called M. le comte de Morcerf, and is a member of the Chambre des pairs."
085.173 Thus this terrible secret, which Beauchamp had buried with such generosity, reappeared like an armed ghost, and another newspaper, cruelly informed, had published, the day after Albert's departure for Normandy, the few lines which had nearly driven the unfortunate young man mad.
086.000 The judgment.
086.001 At eight o'clock in the morning, Albert fell at Beauchamp's house like lightning. The valet had been warned and introduced Morcerf into the room of his master, who had just taken a bath.
086.002 "Well?" said Albert.
086.003 --Well, my poor friend," replied Beauchamp, "I was expecting you.
086.004 -Here I am. I will not tell you, Beauchamp, that I believe you to be too loyal and too good to have spoken of this to anyone; no, my friend. Besides, the message you sent me is a guarantee of your affection. So let us not waste time in preamble: do you have any idea from which side the blow comes?
086.005 --I'll tell you about it later.
086.006 --Yes, but before that, my friend, you owe me, in all its details, the story of this abominable treason."
086.007 And Beauchamp told the young man, crushed with shame and grief, the facts which we shall retell in all their simplicity.
086.008 The morning before, the article had appeared in a newspaper other than _L'Impartial_, and, what gave even more gravity to the affair, in a newspaper well known to belong to the government. Beauchamp was having breakfast when the note jumped out at him; he immediately sent for a cabriolet, and without finishing his meal, he ran to the newspaper.
086.009 Although he professed political sentiments completely opposed to those of the manager of the accusing newspaper, Beauchamp, as sometimes happens, and we will say often, was his close friend.
086.010 When he arrived at his house, the manager was keeping his own newspaper and seemed to be enjoying a _premier-Paris_ on beet sugar, which, probably, was of his own making.
086.011 "Ah, by Jove!" said Beauchamp, "since you keep your own paper, my dear, I need not tell you what brings me here.
086.012 --Are you by any chance a supporter of sugar cane?" asked the manager of the ministerial newspaper.
086.013 --No, replied Beauchamp, I am even a complete stranger to the question; so I have come for something else.
086.014 --And why do you come?
086.015 --For the Morcerf article.
086.016 --Ah, yes, really: isn't that curious?
086.017 --So curious that you risk defamation, it seems to me, and that you risk a very lucky lawsuit.
086.018 --Not at all; we have received with the note all the supporting documents, and we are perfectly convinced that M. de Morcerf will keep quiet; besides, it is a service to the country to denounce to it the wretches unworthy of the honor we do them."
086.019 Beauchamp remained forbidden.
086.020 "But who, then, has informed you so well?" he asked; "for my newspaper, which had given the alarm, was forced to abstain for want of proof, and yet we are more interested than you in exposing M. de Morcerf, since he is a peer of France, and we are in opposition.
086.021 --Oh, my God, it is very simple; we did not run after the scandal, it came to us. A man came to us yesterday from Janina, bringing the formidable file, and as we hesitated to throw ourselves into the path of the accusation, he told us that if we refused the article would appear in another newspaper. Well, you know, Beauchamp, what an important news is; we did not want to let this one go to waste. Now the blow is struck; it is terrible and will resound to the end of Europe."
086.022 Beauchamp understood that there was nothing left but to bow his head, and went out in despair to send a courier to Morcerf.
086.023 But what he had not been able to write to Albert, because the things we are going to relate were subsequent to the departure of his courier, was that on the same day, in the Chamber of Peers, a great agitation had arisen and reigned in the groups usually so calm of the high assembly. Each one had arrived almost before the hour, and was discussing the sinister event which was going to occupy the public attention and fix it on one of the most known members of the illustrious body.
086.024 There were readings in low voices of the article, comments and exchanges of recollections which made the facts even more precise. The Count de Morcerf was not liked among his colleagues. Like all parvenus, he had been forced, to maintain his rank, to observe an excess of height. The great aristocrats laughed at him; the talents repudiated him; the pure glories instinctively despised him. The count was in this unfortunate extremity of the expiatory victim. Once designated by the finger of the Lord for the sacrifice, each one prepared to cry haro.
086.025 Alone, the Count of Morcerf knew nothing. He had not received the newspaper in which the libelous news was found, and had spent the morning writing letters and trying out a horse.
086.026 So he arrived at his usual hour, head held high, eye proud, gait insolent, got out of the carriage, passed the corridors, and entered the hall, without noticing the hesitations of the bailiffs and the half salutes of his colleagues.
086.027 When Morcerf entered, the meeting had already been open for more than half an hour.
086.028 Although the Count, unaware, as we have said, of all that had happened, had changed nothing in his air or his gait, his air and his gait seemed to all to be more proud than usual, and his presence on this occasion seemed so aggressive to this assembly jealous of its honor, that all saw in it an impropriety, many a bravado, some an insult.
086.029 It was obvious that the entire House was eager to begin the debate.
086.030 The accusing paper was in everyone's hands; but, as always, everyone hesitated to take responsibility for the attack. Finally, one of the honorable peers, a declared enemy of the Count de Morcerf, mounted the rostrum with a solemnity that announced that the expected moment had arrived.
086.031 There was a frightening silence; Morcerf alone did not know the cause of the profound attention that was being paid this time to an orator who was not always in the habit of listening so complacently.
086.032 The Count let the preamble pass quietly, by which the speaker established that he was going to speak about something so serious, so sacred, so vital to the House, that he demanded the full attention of his colleagues.
086.033 At the first words of Janina and Colonel Fernand, the Count de Morcerf paled so horribly that there was only a shudder in the assembly, whose eyes converged on the Count.
086.034 Moral wounds have the peculiarity that they hide themselves, but do not close; always painful, always ready to bleed when touched, they remain alive and gaping in the heart.
086.035 The reading of the article completed in the midst of this same silence, disturbed then by a shudder which ceased as soon as the speaker seemed disposed to take the floor again, the accuser exposed his scruples, and set about establishing how difficult his task was; it was the honor of M. de Morcerf, it was that of the whole House which he claimed to defend by provoking a debate which was to tackle these personal questions which are always so burning. Finally, he concluded by asking that an inquiry be ordered, quick enough to confound the calumny before it had time to grow, and to restore M. de Morcerf, by avenging him, to the position which public opinion had long since made for him.
086.036 Morcerf was so overwhelmed, so trembling before this immense and unexpected calamity, that he could scarcely stammer a few words while looking at his confreres with a bewildered eye. This shyness, which could as well be due to the astonishment of the innocent as to the shame of the guilty, conciliated him some sympathies. The truly generous men are always ready to become compassionate, when the misfortune of their enemy exceeds the limits of their hatred.
086.037 The president put the inquiry to a vote; the vote was taken by sitting and standing, and it was decided that the inquiry would proceed.
086.038 The Count was asked how much time he needed to prepare his justification.
086.039 Morcerf's courage had returned as soon as he had felt alive again after that horrible blow.
086. 040 "Gentlemen," he replied, "it is not with time that one repels an attack such as that directed at this moment against me by unknown enemies who have remained in the shadow of their obscurity; it is at once, it is by a thunderbolt that I must answer the lightning which for a moment dazzled me; that is not given to me, instead of such a justification, to have to spill my blood to prove to my colleagues that I am worthy to walk their equal! "
086.041 These words made a favorable impression on the accused.
086.042 "I therefore ask," he said, "that the investigation take place as soon as possible, and I will provide the House with all the documents necessary for the effectiveness of this investigation.
086.043 --What day do you set?" asked the president.
086.044 --I am putting myself at the disposal of the House today," replied the Count.
086.045 The president rang the bell.
086.046 "Is it the opinion of the House," he asked, "that this investigation take place today?
086.047 --Yes!" was the unanimous response of the Assembly.
086.048 A committee of twelve members was appointed to examine the documents to be supplied by Morcerf. The time of the first session of this committee was fixed at eight o'clock in the evening in the offices of the Chamber. If several meetings were necessary, they would take place at the same time and in the same place.
086.049 This decision taken, Morcerf asked permission to withdraw; he had to collect the pieces amassed for a long time by him to face this storm, foreseen by his cautious and indomitable character.
086.050 Beauchamp told the young man all the things we have just said in our turn: only his account had the advantage over ours of the animation of living things over the coldness of dead things.
086.051 Albert listened to him, trembling sometimes with hope, sometimes with anger, sometimes with shame; for, by Beauchamp's confidence, he knew that his father was guilty, and he wondered how, since he was guilty, he could prove his innocence.
086.052 Having reached this point, Beauchamp stopped.
086.053 "Then?" asked Albert.
086.054 --Next?" repeated Beauchamp.
086.055 --Yes.
086.056 -My friend, this word leads me into a horrible necessity. Do you want to know the rest?
086.057 -- I absolutely must know it, my friend, and I would rather hear it from you than from anyone else.
086.058 -- Well," said Beauchamp, "get your courage ready, Albert; you will never need it more.
086.059 Albert passed a hand over his forehead to assure himself of his own strength, like a man who is about to defend his life tries his breastplate and bends the blade of his sword.
086.060 He felt strong, for he took his fever for energy.
086.061 "Go!" he said.
086.062 -Evening arrived, Beauchamp continued. All Paris was waiting for the event. Many claimed that your father had only to show up to bring down the accusation; many also said that the Count would not show up; there were those who claimed to have seen him leave for Brussels, and some went to the police to ask if it was true, as they said, that the Count had taken his passports.
086.063 "I will confess to you that I did everything in the world," Beauchamp continued, "to obtain from one of the members of the commission, a young peer of my friends, to be introduced into a sort of gallery. At seven o'clock he came to take me, and, before anybody had arrived, recommended me to an usher who locked me up in a kind of box. I was hidden by a column and lost in complete darkness; I could hope that I would see and hear from one end to the other the terrible scene that was about to unfold.
086.064 "At exactly eight o'clock everyone had arrived.
086.065 "M. de Morcerf entered at the last stroke of eight. He was holding some papers in his hand, and his countenance seemed calm; against his habit, his gait was simple, his dress elaborate and severe; and, according to the habit of the old soldiers, he wore his habit buttoned from the bottom to the top.
086.066 "His presence produced the best effect: the commission was far from malicious, and several of its members came to the count and gave him their hands."
086.067 Albert felt his heart break at all these details, and yet in the midst of his grief crept a feeling of gratitude; he wished he could have embraced those men who had given his father this mark of esteem in so great an embarrassment to his honor.
086.068 "At this moment an usher entered and handed a letter to the president.
086.069 "--You have the floor, Monsieur de Morcerf," said the president as he unsealed the letter.
086.070 "The Count began his apology, and I assure you, Albert," continued Beauchamp, "that he was of extraordinary eloquence and skill. He produced documents which proved that the Vizier of Janina had, up to his last hour, honored him with all his confidence, since he had charged him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor himself. He showed the ring, sign of command, and with which Ali-Pacha usually sealed his letters, and that this one had given to him so that he could on his return, at any time of the day or night, and even if he was in his harem, penetrate to him. Unfortunately, he said, his negotiation had failed, and when he returned to defend his benefactor, he was already dead. But," said the count, "in dying, Ali-Pacha, so great was his confidence, had entrusted him with his favorite mistress and his daughter."
086.071 Albert flinched at these words, for as Beauchamp spoke, the whole tale of Haydee came back to the young man's mind, and he remembered what the beautiful Greek had said of that message, of that ring, and of how she had been sold and led into slavery.
086.072 "And what was the effect of the Count's speech?" asked Albert anxiously.
086.073 -- "I confess that it moved me, and with me it moved the whole committee," said Beauchamp.
086.074 "However, the president carelessly threw his eyes on the letter which had just been brought to him; but at the first lines his attention was aroused; he read it, reread it again, and, fixing his eyes on M. de Morcerf:
086.075 "--Monsieur le comte," he said, "you have just told us that the Vizier of Janina had entrusted his wife and daughter to you?
086.076 "--Yes, sir," replied Morcerf: "but in this, as in everything else, misfortune pursued me. When I returned, Vasiliki and her daughter Haydée had disappeared.
086.077 "--Did you know them?
086.078 "--My intimacy with the pasha and the supreme confidence he had in my fidelity had allowed me to see them more than twenty times.
086.079 "--Do you have any idea what has become of them?
086.080 "--Yes, sir. I heard that they had succumbed to their grief and perhaps to their misery. I was not rich, my life was in great danger, and I could not go looking for them, to my great regret.
086.081 "The president frowned imperceptibly.
086.082 "-Messieurs," he said, "you have heard and followed the Count de Morcerf and his explanations. I am not sure that I have the right to say anything, but I am not sure that I have the right to say anything at all, and I am not sure that I have the right to say anything.
086.083 "--Alas! No, sir," replied the count, "all those who surrounded the vizier and who knew me at his court are either dead or scattered; I believe that I alone, at least, am the only one of my compatriots to have survived this dreadful war; I have only the letters of Ali-Tebelin, and I have placed them before your eyes; I have only the pledge ring of his will, and here it is; I have finally the most convincing proof that I can provide, that is, after an anonymous attack, the absence of any testimony against my word as an honest man and the purity of my whole military life.
086.084 "There was a murmur of approval in the assembly; at that moment, Albert, and if no incident had occurred, your father's cause was won.
086.085 "There was nothing left to do but vote, when the president spoke.
086.086 "Gentlemen," he said, "and you, sir, I presume, would not be unhappy to hear a very important witness, as he assures us, and who has just appeared of his own accord; this witness, we have no doubt, after all that the Count has told us, is called upon to prove the perfect innocence of our colleague. Here is the letter I have just received in this regard; do you wish it to be read to you, or do you decide that it will be passed over, and that we will not stop at this incident?"
086.087 "M. de Morcerf paled and clenched his hands on the papers he was holding, which screamed between his fingers.
086.088 "The answer of the commission was for the reading: as for the count, he was pensive and had no opinion to express.
086.089 "The president read the following letter accordingly:
086.090 "_Mr. President_,
086.091 "I can provide the commission of inquiry, charged with examining the conduct in Epirus and Macedonia of M. the Lieutenant-General Count de Morcerf, with the most positive information.
086.092 "The president paused briefly.
086.093 "The Count de Morcerf paled; the president questioned the listeners with his eyes.
086.094 "--Continue!" was the cry from all sides.
086.095 "The president continued:
086.096 "_I was on the scene at the death of Ali-Pasha; I witnessed his last moments; I know what became of Vasiliki and Haydée; I stand at the disposal of the commission, and even claim the honor of being heard. I shall be in the vestibule of the Chamber at the moment this bill is handed to you.
086.097 "--And what is this witness, or rather this enemy?" asked the Count in a voice in which it was easy to notice a deep alteration.
086.098 "--We shall know, sir," replied the president. Does the commission agree to hear this witness?
086.099 "--Yes, yes," said all the voices at once.
086.100 "The bailiff was called back.
086.101 "--Bailiff," asked the president, "is there anyone waiting in the vestibule?
086.102 "--Yes, Mr. President.
086.103 "--Who is this someone?
086.104 "--A woman accompanied by a servant.
086.105 Everyone looked at each other.
086.106 "--Send the woman in," said the president.
086.107 "Five minutes later, the bailiff appeared again; all eyes were fixed on the door, and I myself," said Beauchamp, "shared the general expectation and anxiety.
086.108 "Behind the bailiff walked a woman wrapped in a large veil which concealed her completely. One could tell from the shape of the veil and the perfume that was given off that it was a young, elegant woman, but that was all.
086.109 "The president asked the unknown woman to remove her veil, and it was then possible to see that this woman was dressed in Greek style; moreover, she was of supreme beauty.
086.110 --Ah!" said Morcerf, "it was her.
086.111 --How, her?
086.112 --Yes, Haydée.
086.113 --Who told you that?
086.114 -- Alas! I can guess. But go on, Beauchamp, I beg you. You see that I am calm and strong. And yet we must approach the denouement.
086.115 --M. de Morcerf, continued Beauchamp, looked at this woman with a surprise mingled with fright. For him it was life or death that was about to come out of that charming mouth; for everyone else it was an adventure so strange and so full of curiosity, that the salvation or loss of M. de Morcerf was already entering into this event only as a secondary element.
086.116 "The president offered the young woman a seat with his hand; but she nodded that she would remain standing. As for the Count, he had fallen back into his chair, and it was obvious that his legs refused to carry him.
086.117 "--Madam," said the president, "you wrote to the commission to give them information about the Janina affair, and you claimed that you had been an eyewitness to the events.
086.118 "--I was indeed," replied the unknown woman with a voice full of charming sadness, and imbued with that sound peculiar to oriental voices.
086.119 "--However," continued the president, "allow me to tell you that you were very young then.
086.120 "--I was four years old; but as the events were of supreme importance to me, not a detail left my mind, not a particularity escaped my memory.
086.121 "--But what importance did these events have for you, and who are you that this great catastrophe produced such a deep impression on you?
086.122 "--It was a question of my father's life or death," replied the girl, "and my name is Haydée, daughter of Ali-Tebelin, pasha of Janina, and of Vasiliki, his beloved wife."
086.123 "The modest and proud blush, all at once, that filled the cheeks of the young woman, the fire of her gaze and the majesty of her revelation, produced an inexpressible effect on the assembly.
086.124 "As for the Count, he would not have been more annihilated, if the lightning, in falling, had opened an abyss at his feet.
086.125 "--Madam," resumed the president, after bowing respectfully, "allow me a simple question which is not a doubt, and this question will be the last: Can you justify the authenticity of what you say?
086. 126 "--I can, sir," said Haydée, drawing from under her veil a sachet of perfumed satin, "for here is the record of my birth, drawn up by my father and signed by his principal officers; for here, with the record of my birth, is the record of my baptism, my father having consented to my being brought up in the religion of my mother, which record the great primate of Macedonia and Epirus has sealed; Finally (and this is probably the most important) is the deed of sale of my person and that of my mother to the Armenian merchant El-Kobbir, by the Frankish officer who, in his infamous bargain with the Porte, had reserved for himself, for his share of the booty, the daughter and wife of his benefactor, whom he sold for the sum of a thousand purses, that is to say, for about four hundred thousand francs.
086.127 "A greenish pallor invaded the cheeks of the Count de Morcerf, and his eyes became bloodshot at the utterance of these terrible imputations, which were greeted by the assembly with a gloomy silence.
086.128 "Haydée, still calm, but much more threatening in her calm than another would have been in her anger, handed the president the bill of sale written in Arabic.
086.129 "As it had been thought that some of the documents produced would be written in Arabic, Roman or Turkish, the interpreter of the House had been warned; he was called. One of the noble peers to whom the Arabic language, which he had learned during the sublime campaign of Egypt, was familiar, followed on the vellum the reading which the translator made aloud:
086.130 "I, El-Kobbir, slave trader and purveyor of the harem of S.H., acknowledge that I have received, for delivery to the sublime emperor, from the Frankish lord count of Monte Cristo, an emerald valued at two thousand purses, for the price of a young Christian slave girl of eleven years of age, by the name of Haydée, and recognized daughter of the late lord Ali-Tebelin, pasha of Janina, and of Vasiliki, his favorite; who had been sold to me, seven years ago, with her mother, who died on arriving in Constantinople, by a Frankish colonel in the service of the vizier Ali-Tebelin, named Fernand Mondego. _
086.131 "_The above-mentioned sale was made to me on behalf of H.H., whose mandate I had, for the sum of one thousand purses.
086.132 "_Done at Constantinople, with the authorization of H.H. in the year 1274 of the Hegira._
086.133 "_Signed EL-KOBBIR_."
086.134 "_This deed, to give it full faith, belief, and authenticity, shall be sealed with the imperial seal, which the vendor undertakes to have affixed thereto._"
086.135 "Near the merchant's signature was indeed seen the seal of the sublime emperor.
086.136 "To this reading and sight succeeded a terrible silence; the count had only his gaze, and this gaze, attached as if in spite of himself to Haydée, seemed of flame and blood.
086.137 "--Madame," said the president, "can we not question the Count of Monte Cristo, who I believe is in Paris near you?
086.138 "--Monsieur," replied Haydée, "the Count of Monte Cristo, my other father, has been in Normandy for three days.
086.139 "But then, madam," said the president, "who advised you to take this step, a step for which the court thanks you and which, moreover, is quite natural in view of your birth and your misfortunes?
086.140 "-Sir," replied Haydée, "this step was advised to me by my respect and by my pain. Though a Christian, God forgive me, I have always thought of avenging my illustrious father. Now, when I set foot in France, when I knew that the traitor lived in Paris, my eyes and my ears remained constantly open. I live withdrawn in the house of my noble protector, but I live like this because I like the shade and the silence which allow me to live in my thought and in my recollection. But M. le Comte de Monte-Cristo surrounds me with paternal care, and nothing that constitutes the life of the world is foreign to me; only I accept only the distant noise of it. Thus I read all the newspapers, as all the albums are sent to me, as I receive all the melodies, and it is by following, without lending myself to it, the life of others, that I knew what had happened this morning in the Chamber of Peers and what was to happen there this evening... So I wrote.
086.141 "-So," asked the president, "the Count of Monte Cristo has nothing to do with your action?
086.142 "--He is completely unaware of it, sir, and even I have only one fear, that he will disapprove of it when he learns of it; however, it is a beautiful day for me," continued the young girl, raising her gaze to heaven, "the one in which I finally find the opportunity to avenge my father.
086.143 "The Count, during all this time, had not uttered a single word; his colleagues looked at him and no doubt pitied this fortune broken under the perfumed breath of a woman; his misfortune was written little by little in sinister features on his face.
086.144 "--Monsieur de Morcerf," said the president, "do you recognize madame as the daughter of Ali-Tebelin, pasha of Janina?
086.145 "--No," said Morcerf, making an effort to stand up, "and this is a plot hatched by my enemies.
086.146 "Haydée, who was holding her eyes fixed on the door, as if she were expecting someone, turned abruptly, and, finding the Count standing, she uttered a terrible cry:
086.147 "-You do not recognize me," she said; "well, I, fortunately, recognize you! you are Fernand Mondego, the frank officer who instructed the troops of my noble father. It is you who delivered the castles of Janina! it is you who, sent by him to Constantinople to treat directly with the emperor of the life or death of your benefactor, brought back a false firman which granted full grace! It is you who, with this firman, obtained the ring of the pasha who had to make you obeyed by Selim, the keeper of the fire; it is you who stabbed Selim! It is you who sold us, my mother and me, to the merchant El-Kobbir! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! You still have your master's blood on your forehead!
086.148 "These words had been pronounced with such an enthusiasm of truth, that all eyes turned to the Count's forehead, and he himself put his hand to it as if he had felt, still warm, the blood of Ali.
086.149 "--So you positively recognize M. de Morcerf as being the same as the officer Fernand Mondego?
086.150 "--I recognize him!" cried Haydée. Oh, my mother! you said to me: 'You were free, you had a father you loved, you were destined to be almost a queen! Look closely at this man, it is he who made you a slave, it is he who raised your father's head on a pike, it is he who sold us, it is he who delivered us! Look carefully at his right hand, the one with a large scar; if you forgot his face, you would recognize him by this hand in which the gold coins of the merchant El-Kobbir have fallen one by one!" If I recognize him! Oh! let him say now himself if he does not recognize me.
086.151 "Each word fell like a cutlass on Morcerf and took away a bit of his energy; at the last words, he hid his hand, mutilated indeed by a wound, in his chest, and fell back into his armchair, sunk in a dreary despair.
086.152 "This scene had caused the spirits of the assembly to swirl, as one sees the leaves detached from the trunk run under the powerful north wind.
086.153 "-Monsieur le Comte de Morcerf," said the president, "do not let yourself be dismayed, answer: the justice of the court is supreme and equal for all as that of God; it will not let you be crushed by your enemies without giving you the means to fight them. Do you want new investigations? Do you want me to order a trip of two members of the House to Janina? Speak up!
086.154 "Morcerf answered nothing.
086.155 "Then all the members of the commission looked at each other with a sort of terror. One knew the Count's energetic and violent character. It took a terrible prostration to annihilate the defense of this man; it was necessary to think that to this silence, which resembled sleep, would succeed an awakening that would resemble lightning.
086.156 "--Well," asked the president, "what have you decided?
086.157 "--Nothing!" said the Count, rising to his feet with a dull voice.
086.158 "--The daughter of Ali-Tebelin," said the president, "has really declared the truth? She is really the terrible witness to whom it always happens that the guilty party does not dare to answer: NO? you have really done all the things of which you are accused?
086.159 "The Count cast around him a look whose desperate expression would have touched tigers, but it could not disarm judges; then he raised his eyes to the vault, and immediately turned them away, as if he had feared that this vault, by opening, would make that second tribunal which is called heaven, that other judge who is called God, shine.
086.160 "Then, with a sudden movement, he tore off the buttons of that closed garment which was suffocating him, and left the room like a dark fool; for a moment his step resounded lugubriously under the sonorous vault, then soon the rolling of the carriage which was galloping him shook the portico of the Florentine building.
086.161 "--Messieurs," said the president when silence had been restored, "is the Count de Morcerf convinced of felony, treason, and indignity?
086.162 "--Yes!" replied all the members of the commission of inquiry in a unanimous voice.
086.163 "Haydée had been present until the end of the session; she heard the Count's sentence pronounced without one of the features of his face expressing either joy or pity.
086.164 "Then, drawing her veil over her face, she majestically saluted the councilors, and went out with that step with which Virgil saw the goddesses walk."
087.000 The provocation.
087.001 "Then," continued Beauchamp, "I took advantage of the silence and darkness of the room to leave without being seen. The bailiff who had introduced me was waiting for me at the door. He led me, through the corridors, to a small door giving onto the rue de Vaugirard. I went out with my soul broken and delighted at the same time, forgive me this expression, Albert, broken in relation to you, delighted by the nobility of this young girl pursuing her father's revenge. Yes, I swear to you, Albert, from wherever this revelation comes, I say, that it may come from an enemy, but that this enemy is only the agent of Providence."
087.002 Albert held his head between his two hands; he lifted his face, red with shame and bathed in tears, and grasped Beauchamp's arm.
087.003 "Friend," he said to him, "my life is over: it remains for me, not to say, as you do, that Providence has dealt me the blow, but to seek out which man is pursuing me with his enmity; then, when I know him, I will kill that man, or that man will kill me; now, I am counting on your friendship to help me, Beauchamp, if, however, scorn has not killed it in your heart.
087.004 - Contempt, my friend? And how will this misfortune affect you? No! Thank God! We are no longer in the time when an unjust prejudice made sons responsible for the actions of their fathers. Look back at your whole life, Albert, it is true that it dates back to yesterday, but was there ever a more pure dawn than your east? No, Albert, believe me, you are young, you are rich, leave France: everything is quickly forgotten in this great Babylon with its agitated existence and changing tastes; you will come in three or four years, you will have married some Russian princess, and no one will think any more of what happened yesterday, let alone what happened sixteen years ago.
087.005 --Thank you, my dear Beauchamp, thank you for the excellent intention which dictates your words, but it cannot be so, I have told you my desire, and now, if necessary, I will change the word desire into that of will. You understand that interested as I am in this matter, I cannot see the thing from the same point of view as you. What seems to you to come from a heavenly source seems to me to come from a less pure source. Providence seems to me, I confess, very alien to all this, and that fortunately, because instead of the invisible and impalpable messenger of celestial rewards and punishments, I will find a palpable and visible being, on whom I will take revenge, oh, yes, I swear it to you, for all that I have been suffering for the past month. Now, I repeat to you, Beauchamp, I want to return to human and material life, and, if you are still my friend as you say, help me to find the hand that struck the blow.
087.006 -Then so be it!" said Beauchamp; "and if you insist on my going down to earth, I will do so; if you insist on searching for an enemy, I will go with you. And I will find him, for my honor is almost as interested as yours in finding him.
087.007 --Well, then, Beauchamp, you understand, at this very moment, without delay, let us begin our investigations. Every minute of delay is an eternity for me; the informer is not yet punished, so he can hope that he will not be; and, on my honor, if he hopes so, he is mistaken!
087.008 --Well, listen to me, Morcerf.
087.009 --Ah! Beauchamp, I see that you know something; here, you give me back my life!
087.010 -- I don't say that this is reality, Albert, but it is at least a light in the night: by following this light, perhaps it will lead us to the goal.
087.011 --Say! You can see that I am bawling with impatience.
087.012 -- Well, I'm going to tell you what I didn't want to tell you on my way back from Janina.
087.013 --Speak.
087.014 --This is what happened, Albert; I went quite naturally to the first banker in town to get information; at the first word I said of the affair, even before your father's name was spoken:
087.015 "--Ah!" he said, "very well, I can guess what brings you here.
087.016 "-How and why?
087.017 "--Because only a fortnight ago I was questioned on the same subject.
087.018 "--By whom?
087.019 "--By a banker in Paris, my correspondent.
087.020 "--Who do you name?
087.021 "--Mr. Danglars."
087.022 --Him!" exclaimed Albert; "indeed, it is he who for so long has pursued my poor father with his jealous hatred; he, the so-called popular man, who cannot forgive the Count de Morcerf for being peer of France. And, behold, this rupture of marriage without any reason given; yes, that is indeed what it is.
087.023 --Inform yourself, Albert (but don't get carried away beforehand), inform yourself, I tell you, and if the thing is true...
087.024 --Oh, yes, if it is true!" cried the young man, "he will pay me for all that I have suffered.
087.025 --Beware, Morcerf, he is already an old man.
087.026 -- I will have regard for his age as he has had regard for the honor of my family; if he was angry with my father, why didn't he strike my father? Oh, no, he was afraid to face a man!
087.027 --Albert, I am not condemning you, I am only restraining you; Albert, act prudently.
087.028 --Oh, don't be afraid; besides, you will accompany me, Beauchamp, solemn things must be dealt with before a witness. Before the end of this day, if M. Danglars is the guilty party, M. Danglars will have ceased to live or I shall be dead. By God, Beauchamp, I want to give my honor a nice funeral!
087.029 --Well, then, when such resolutions are made, Albert, they must be put into effect at once. You want to go to Mr. Danglars? Let's go."
087.030 A cabriolet was sent for. On entering the banker's hotel, the phaeton and Mr. Andrea Cavalcanti's servant were seen at the door.
087.031 "Ah! parbleu! voilà qui va bien," said Albert in a sombre voice. If M. Danglars does not want to fight with me, I will kill his son-in-law. That must fight, a Cavalcanti."
087.032 The young man was announced to the banker, who, in Albert's name, knowing what had happened the day before, had his door defended. But it was too late, he had followed the lackey; he heard the order given, forced the door and penetrated, followed by Beauchamp, until the cabinet of the banker.
087.033 "But, sir!" cried the latter, "is one no longer master of receiving in one's house whom one wishes, or whom one does not wish? It seems to me that you are strangely forgetting yourself.
087.034 -- "No, sir," said Albert coldly, "there are circumstances, and you are in one of those circumstances, in which it is necessary, except for cowardice, I offer you this refuge, to be at home for certain persons at least.
087.035 --So what do you want from me, sir?
087.036 --I want," said Morcerf, approaching without seeming to pay any attention to Cavalcanti, who was leaning against the chimney, "I want to propose a rendezvous in a secluded corner, where no one will disturb you for ten minutes, I ask no more; where, of the two men who have met, one will remain under the leaves."
087.037 Danglars paled, Cavalcanti made a movement. Albert turned back to the young man:
087.038 "Oh, my God!" he said, "come if you like, Monsieur le Comte, you have a right to be there, you are almost one of the family, and I give these rendezvous outings to as many people as will be found to accept them."
087.039 Cavalcanti looked with a stunned air at Danglars, who, making an effort, rose and advanced between the two young people. Albert's attack on Andrea had just placed him on another ground, and he hoped that Albert's visit had another cause than the one he had first supposed.
087.040 "Ah, sir," he said to Albert, "if you come here to quarrel with the gentleman because I have preferred him to you, I warn you that I will make a matter for the king's prosecutor.
087.041 -- "You are mistaken, sir," said Morcerf with a dark smile, "I am not talking about marriage in the least, and I am only addressing M. Cavalcanti because he seemed to me to have had the intention for a moment of intervening in our discussion. And then, behold, you are right," he said, "I am now seeking to quarrel with everyone; but rest assured, Mr. Danglars, the priority belongs to you.
087.042 - "Sir," replied Danglars, pale with anger and fear, "I warn you that when I have the misfortune to meet a rabid dog on my path, I kill him, and, far from believing myself guilty, I think I have done society a service. Now, if you are enraged and you tend to bite me, I warn you, I will kill you without mercy. Is it my fault that your father is dishonored?
087.043 --Yes, wretch!" cried Morcerf, "it is your fault!
087.044 Danglars took a step back.
087.045 "My fault!" he said; "but you are mad! Do I know Greek history? Have I traveled to all those countries? Was it I who advised your father to sell the castles of Janina? to betray...
087.046 -Silence!" said Albert in a dull voice. No, it was not you who directly caused this outburst and this misfortune, but it was you who hypocritically provoked it.
087.047 --Me!
087.048 --Yes, you! Where did the revelation come from?
087.049 --But it seems to me that the newspaper told you: from Janina, by Jove!
087.050 --Who wrote to Janina?
087.051 --To Janina?
087.052 --Yes. Who wrote to ask about my father?
087.053 --It seems to me that anyone can write to Janina.
087.054 --One person wrote, however.
087.055 --One person?
087.056 --Yes! and that person is you.
087.057 --I wrote, no doubt; it seems to me that when one marries one's daughter to a young man, one can take information about the family of that young man; it is not only a right, but also a duty.
087.058 --You have written, sir," said Albert, knowing perfectly well the answer that would come to you.
087.059 --Me? Ah, I swear it," cried Danglars with a confidence and security that came less from his fear than from the interest he felt deep down for the unfortunate young man; "I swear to you that I would never have thought of writing to Janina. Did I know about Ali-Pasha's catastrophe?
087.060 -So someone pushed you to write?
087.061 --Certainly.
087.062 -- Someone pushed you?
087.063 --Yes.
087.064 --Who? ... finish... say...
087.065 --Goddamn it! Nothing simpler, I was talking about your father's past, I was saying that the source of his fortune had always remained obscure. The person asked me where your father had made this fortune. I answered: "In Greece. Then she said to me, "Well, write to Janina."
087.066 --And who gave you this advice?
087.067 --The Count of Monte Cristo, your friend.
087.068 --The Count of Monte Cristo told you to write to Janina?
087.069 -- Yes, and I wrote. Do you want to see my correspondence? I will show it to you."
087.070 Albert and Beauchamp looked at each other.
087.071 "Sir," said Beauchamp, who had not yet spoken, "it seems to me that you are accusing the Count, who is absent from Paris, and who cannot justify himself at the moment?
087.072 --I am not accusing anyone, sir," said Danglars, "I am recounting, and I will repeat before the Count of Monte Cristo what I have just said before you.
087.073 --And the Count knows what answer you received?
087.074 -- I showed it to him.
087.075 --Did he know that my father's baptismal name was Fernand, and that his family name was Mondego?
087.076 -- Yes, I had told him that a long time ago, and I only did what anyone else would have done in my place, and perhaps even much less. When, the day after this reply, urged on by M. de Monte-Cristo, your father came to ask me for my daughter officially, as is done when one wants to get it over with, I refused, I refused outright, it is true, but without explanation, without outburst. Indeed, why would I have made a fuss? What does the honor or dishonor of M. de Morcerf matter to me? That neither raised nor lowered the rent."
087.077 Albert felt the blush rise to his forehead; there was no longer any doubt, Danglars was defending himself with the baseness, but with the assurance of a man who tells, if not the whole truth, at least a part of the truth, not from conscience, it is true, but from terror. Besides, what was Morcerf looking for? It was not the greater or lesser guilt of Danglars or Monte Cristo, it was a man who would answer for the slight or serious offense, it was a man who would fight, and it was obvious that Danglars would not fight.
087.078 And then, each of the forgotten or unnoticed things became visible again to his eyes or present to his memory. Monte-Cristo knew everything, since he had bought the daughter of Ali-Pacha, and knowing everything, he had advised Danglars to write to Janina. This known answer, he had acceded to the desire manifested by Albert to be presented to Haydée; once in front of her, he had let the interview fall on the death of Ali, not opposing the account of Haydée (but having undoubtedly given to the young girl in the few Roman words which he had pronounced instructions which had not allowed Morcerf to recognize his father); moreover had he not requested Morcerf not to pronounce the name of his father in front of Haydée? Finally, he had led Albert to Normandy at the moment when he knew that the great event was to take place. There was no doubt about it, all this was a calculation, and, without any doubt, Monte-Cristo was getting along with his father's enemies.
087.079 Albert took Beauchamp into a corner and told him all his ideas.
087.080 "You are right," said the latter; "M. Danglars is, in what has happened, only for the brutal and material part; it is to M. de Monte-Cristo that you must ask for an explanation."
087.081 Albert turned around.
087.082 "Sir," he said to Danglars, "you understand that I am not yet taking a definitive leave of absence from you; it remains for me to know whether your charges are just, and I am going to make sure of that at the home of M. le Comte de Monte-Cristo."
087.083 And, saluting the banker, he went out with Beauchamp without appearing otherwise to care for Cavalcanti.
087.084 Danglars led them back to the door, and, at the door, renewed to Albert the assurance that no motive of personal hatred animated him against M. le Comte de Morcerf.
088.000 The insult.
088.001 At the banker's door, Beauchamp stopped Morcerf.
088.002 "Listen," he said to him, "just now I told you, at M. Danglars', that it was to M. de Monte Cristo that you should ask for an explanation?
088.003 -- Yes, and we are going to his house.
088.004 -- One moment, Morcerf; before going to the Count's house, think.
088.005 -- What do you want me to think about?
088.006 -- About the seriousness of the approach.
088.007 --Is it more serious than going to Mr. Danglars'?
088.008 -- Yes; Mr. Danglars was a man of money, and you know that men of money know too well the capital they risk to fight easily. The other, on the contrary, is a gentleman, in appearance at least; but do you not fear, under the gentleman, to meet the bravo?
088.009 -- I fear only one thing, to find a man who does not fight.
088.010 --Oh, rest assured, said Beauchamp, that one will fight. I am even afraid of one thing, that he will fight too well; beware!
088.011 --Ami, said Morcerf with a beautiful smile, that is what I ask; and the happiest thing that can happen to me is to be killed for my father: that will save us all.
088.012 -- Your mother will die!
088.013 --Poor mother! said Albert, passing his hand over his eyes, I know that; but it is better that she should die of this than of shame.
088.014 -- Are you quite decided, Albert?
088.015 -- Yes.
088.016 -Go on! But do you think we'll find him?
088.017 --He was to return a few hours after me, and certainly he will be back."
088.018 They went upstairs, and were led down the Avenue des Champs-Élysées, No. 30.
088.019 Beauchamp wanted to go down alone, but Albert pointed out to him that this affair, being out of the ordinary rules, allowed him to depart from the etiquette of the duel.
088.020 The young man was acting in all this for such a holy cause, that Beauchamp had nothing else to do but lend himself to all his wishes: he therefore yielded to Morcerf and was content to follow him.
088.021 Albert only made a leap from the concierge's lodge to the staircase. It was Baptistin who received him.
088.022 The Count had indeed just arrived, but he was in the bath, and had forbidden to receive anyone in the world.
088.023 "But after the bath?" asked Morcerf.
088.024 --Monsieur will dine.
088.025 --And after dinner?
088.026 --Monsieur will sleep for an hour.
088.027 --Then?
088.028 --Then he will go to the opera.
088.029 --Are you sure? asked Albert.
088.030 --Perfectly sure; monsieur has ordered his horses for eight o'clock sharp.
088.031 --Fine, replied Albert; that is all I wanted to know."
088.032 Then, turning to Beauchamp:
088.033 "If you have anything to do, Beauchamp, do it at once; if you have an appointment tonight, put it off until tomorrow. You understand that I am counting on you to go to the Opera. If you can, bring me Château-Renaud."
088.034 Beauchamp took advantage of the permission and left Albert after promising to pick him up at a quarter to eight.
088.035 When he returned home, Albert told Franz, Debray, and Morrel that he wanted to see them that evening at the Opera.
088.036 Then he went to visit his mother, who, since the events of the day before, had had her door defended and was guarding the room. He found her in bed, crushed by the pain of this public humiliation.
088.037 The sight of Albert produced on Mercédès the effect which one could expect; she tightened the hand of her son and burst into tears. However, these tears relieved her.
088.038 Albert remained a moment standing and mute near the face of his mother. One could see by his pale face and frowning eyebrows that his resolution to take revenge was becoming more and more dull in his heart.
088.039 "My mother," asked Albert, "do you know any enemy of M. de Morcerf?"
088.040 Mercédès flinched; she had noticed that the young man had not said: to my father.
088.041 "My friend," she said, "people in the Count's position have many enemies they do not know. Besides, the enemies one knows are not, as you know, the most dangerous.
088.042 --Yes, I know that, so I appeal to all your insight. Mother, you are such a superior woman that nothing escapes you!
088.043 --Why are you telling me this?
088.044 --Because you noticed, for example, that on the evening of the ball we gave, M. de Monte Cristo did not want to take anything from our house."
088.045 Mercédès rose trembling on her arm burned by fever:
088.046 "M. de Monte Cristo!" she cried, "and what would that have to do with the question you are asking me?
088.047 --As you know, my mother, M. de Monte Cristo is almost a man of the East, and Orientals, to preserve all freedom of vengeance, never eat or drink in the homes of their enemies.
088.048 -Mr. de Monte Cristo, our enemy, you say, Albert?" resumed Mercedes, becoming paler than the sheet that covered her. Who told you that? Why? You are mad, Albert. M. de Monte Cristo has had nothing but politeness for us. Mr. de Monte Cristo saved your life, it was you who introduced him to us. Oh, I beg you, my son, if you had such an idea, put it aside, and if I have a recommendation to make to you, I will say more, if I have a prayer to address to you, behave yourself with him.
088.049 --My mother," replied the young man with a gloomy look, "you have your reasons for telling me to spare this man.
088.050 --Me!" cried Mercedes, blushing with the same rapidity with which she had turned pale, and almost immediately becoming even paler than before.
088.051 --Yes, no doubt, and that reason, is it not," resumed Albert, "is that this man cannot harm us?"
088.052 Mercedes shuddered; and fixing on her son a scrutinizing glance:
088.053 "You speak to me strangely," she said to Albert, "and you have singular prejudices, it seems to me. What has the Count done to you? Three days ago you were with him in Normandy; three days ago I looked at him and you yourself looked at him as your best friend."
088.054 An ironic smile grazed Albert's lips. Mercédès saw this smile, and with her double instinct of wife and mother she guessed everything; but, prudent and strong, she hid her trouble and her shudders.
088.055 Albert dropped the conversation; after a moment the countess resumed it.
088.056 "You came to ask me how I was," she said, "I will answer you frankly, my friend, that I do not feel well. You should move in here, Albert, you would keep me company; I need not to be alone.
088.057 --My mother," said the young man, "I would be at your command, and you know how happy I would be, if some pressing and important matter did not force me to leave you all evening.
088.058 --Ah, very well," replied Mercedes with a sigh; "go, Albert, I do not want to make you a slave to your filial piety."
088.059 Albert pretended not to hear, saluted his mother and went out. No sooner had the young man closed the door than Mercedes called a trusted servant and ordered him to follow Albert wherever he went that evening, and to report to her at once.
088.060 Then she rang for her maid, and, weak as she was, had herself dressed to be ready for any event.
088.061 The mission given to the lackey was not difficult to execute. Albert went home and dressed with a sort of severe search. At ten minutes to eight Beauchamp arrived: he had seen Château-Renaud, who had promised to be at the orchestra before the curtain rose.
088.062 Both climbed into Albert's coupe, who, having no reason to hide where he was going, said aloud:
088.063 "To the Opera!"
088.064 In his impatience, he had anticipated the raising of the curtain. Château-Renaud was at his stall: warned of everything by Beauchamp, Albert had no explanation to give him. The conduct of this son seeking to avenge his father was so simple that Château-Renaud made no attempt to dissuade him, and contented himself with renewing the assurance that he was at his disposal.
088.065 Debray had not yet arrived, but Albert knew that he rarely missed a performance at the Opera. Albert wandered the theater until the curtain rose. He hoped to meet Monte Cristo, either in the corridor or on the stairs. The bell called him to his seat, and he came to sit at the orchestra, between Château-Renaud and Beauchamp.
088.066 But his eyes did not leave this box of between-columns which, during all the first act, seemed to persist in remaining closed.
088.067 At last, as Albert, for the hundredth time, questioned his watch, at the beginning of the second act, the door of the dressing room opened, and Monte Cristo, dressed in black, entered and leaned on the banister to look into the room; Morrel followed him, looking with his eyes for his sister and his brother-in-law. He saw them in a box in the second row, and waved to them.
088.068 The count, casting his circular glance around the room, saw a pale head and sparkling eyes which seemed to attract his gaze avidly; he recognized Albert, but the expression which he noticed on this upset face advised him without doubt not to have noticed him. Without making any movement that would reveal his thought, he sat down, drew his binocular from its case, and looked at another side.
088.069 But, without appearing to see Albert, the Count did not lose sight of him, and, when the curtain fell on the end of the second act, his unerring and sure glance followed the young man coming out of the orchestra and accompanied by his two friends.
088.070 Then, the same head appeared again at the windows of a first box, opposite his own. The Count felt the storm coming to him, and when he heard the key turn in the lock of his dressing room, although he was talking to Morrel at that very moment with his most laughing face, the Count knew what to expect, and he had prepared himself for anything.
088.071 The door opened.
088.072 Only then did Monte Cristo turn and see Albert, livid and trembling; behind him were Beauchamp and Château-Renaud.
088.073 "Well!" he exclaimed with that benevolent politeness which usually distinguished his greeting from the banal civilities of the world, "here is my rider arrived at the goal! Good evening, Monsieur de Morcerf."
088.074 And the face of this man, so singularly master of himself, expressed the most perfect cordiality.
088.075 Morrel then only remembered the letter he had received from the viscount, and in which, without further explanation, the latter asked him to be at the Opera; and he understood that something terrible was going to happen.
088.076 "We have not come here to exchange hypocritical politenesses or false pretenses of friendship," said the young man; "we have come to ask you for an explanation, Monsieur le Comte."
088.077 The young man's trembling voice could hardly pass between his clenched teeth.
088.078 "An explanation at the Opera?" said the Count with that tone so calm and with that glance so penetrating, that one recognizes from this double character the man eternally sure of himself. However unfamiliar I may be with Parisian habits, I would not have believed, sir, that it was there that explanations were required.
088.079 -- However, when people are hidden away," said Albert, "when one cannot penetrate to them under the pretext that they are in the bath, at the table, or in bed, one must address oneself to where one meets them.
088.080 --I am not difficult to meet, said Monte Cristo, for only yesterday, sir, if I remember correctly, you were at my house.
088.081 -- "Yesterday, sir," said the young man, whose head was becoming confused, "I was at your house because I did not know who you were."
088.082 And in saying these words Albert had raised his voice in such a way that the people placed in the neighboring lodges heard him, as well as those who passed in the corridor. So the people in the boxes turned around, and those in the corridor stopped behind Beauchamp and Château-Renaud at the sound of this altercation.
088.083 "Where did you come from, sir?" said Monte Cristo without the least apparent emotion. You don't seem to be enjoying your common sense.
088.084 --Provided that I understand your perfidy, sir, and that I manage to make you understand that I want to take revenge, I will always be reasonable enough, said Albert furiously.
088.085 --Monsieur, I do not understand you, replied Monte-Cristo, and, even if I did understand you, you would still speak too loudly. I am at home here, sir, and I alone have the right to raise my voice above the others. Get out, sir!"
088.086 And Monte Cristo showed Albert the door with an admirable gesture of command.
088.087 "Ah, I'll get you out of your house! I am not a man of the world," said Albert, crumpling up his glove in his convulsive hands, which the Count did not lose sight of.
088.088 "Well, well!" said Monte Cristo phlegmatically; "you are seeking a quarrel with me, sir; I see that; but a piece of advice, viscount, and remember it well: it is a bad custom to make noise by provoking. Noise does not suit everybody, Monsieur de Morcerf."
088.089 At this name a murmur of astonishment passed like a shudder among the listeners to this scene. Since the day before the name of Morcerf had been in every mouth.
088.090 Albert, better than all of them, and the first of all, understood the allusion, and made a gesture to throw his glove in the face of the count; but Morrel seized his wrist, while Beauchamp and Château-Renaud, fearing that the scene had gone beyond the bounds of a provocation, held him back.
088.091 But Monte Cristo, without rising, tilting his chair, extended his hand only, and grasping between the young man's clenched fingers the wet, crushed glove:
088.092 "Sir," he said with a terrible accent, "I hold your glove to be thrown away, and I will send it to you rolled around a ball. Now get out of my house, or I will call my servants and have you thrown out."
088.093 Drunk, frightened, with bloodshot eyes, Albert took two steps back.
088.094 Morrel took the opportunity to close the door.
088.095 Monte Cristo took up his binoculars again and began to stare, as if nothing extraordinary had just happened.
088.096 This man had a heart of bronze and a face of marble. Morrel leaned into his ear.
088.097 "What have you done to him?
088.098 --Me? Nothing, personally at least," said Monte Cristo.
088.099 -However, this strange scene must have a cause?
088.100 --The Count de Morcerf's adventure exasperates the unfortunate young man.
088.101 --Did you have anything to do with it?
088.102 --It was through Haydée that the Chamber was informed of her father's treason.
088.103 -- Indeed, said Morrel, I was told, but I had not wanted to believe it, that this Greek slave whom I saw with you here, in this very box, was the daughter of Ali-Pasha.
088.104 --That is the truth, however.
088.105 --Oh, my God!" said Morrel, "I understand everything then, and this scene was premeditated.
088.106 --How so?
088.107 --Yes, Albert wrote to me to be at the opera this evening; it was to make me a witness to the insult he wanted to make to you.
088.108 --Probably, said Monte Cristo with his imperturbable calm.
088.109 --But what will you do with him?
088.110 --Who?
088.111 --Albert!
088.112 --Albert?" said Monte Cristo in the same tone, "what will I do with him, Maximilian? As long as you are here and I shake your hand, I will kill him tomorrow before ten o'clock in the morning. That is what I will do with him."
088.113 Morrel, in his turn, took Monte Cristo's hand in both of his, and he shuddered as he felt that cold, calm hand.
088.114 "Ah, Count," he said, "his father loves him so much!
088.115 --Don't tell me these things!" cried Monte Cristo with the first movement of anger he seemed to feel; "I would make him suffer!
088.116 Morrel, stunned, dropped Monte Cristo's hand.
088.117 "Count! Count!" he said.
088.118 --Dear Maximilian," interrupted the Count, "listen to the adorable way in which Duprez sings this phrase: _O Mathilde! idol of my soul._ Here, I guessed the first Duprez at Naples and I applauded the first. Bravo! bravo!"
088.119 Morrel understood that there was nothing more to say, and he waited.
088.120 The canvas, which had risen at the end of Albert's scene, fell back almost immediately. There was a knock at the door.
088.121 "Come in," said Monte Cristo, without his voice detecting the slightest emotion.
088.122 Beauchamp appeared.
088.123 "Good evening, Monsieur Beauchamp," said Monte Cristo, as if he were seeing the journalist for the first time that evening; "please be seated.
088.124 Beauchamp saluted, entered and sat down.
088.125 "Sir," he said to Monte Cristo, "I was just now, as you saw, accompanying M. de Morcerf.
088.126 "Which means," said Monte Cristo, laughing, "that you have probably just dined together. I am glad to see, Monsieur Beauchamp, that you are more sober than he is.
088.127 "Sir," said Beauchamp, "Albert was, I agree, wrong to get carried away, and I have come to apologize to you on my own account. Now that my apologies are made, mine, do you hear, Monsieur le Comte, I come to tell you that I believe you to be too gallant a man to refuse to give me some explanation of your relations with the people of Janina; then I will add two words about this young Greek girl."
088.128 Monte Cristo made a little gesture with his lip and eyes that commanded silence.
088.129 "Come on!" he added, laughing, "here are all my hopes destroyed.
088.130 --How so?" asked Beauchamp.
088.131 - "No doubt you are hastening to make me a reputation for eccentricity: I am, according to you, a Lara, a Manfred, a Lord Ruthwen; then, the moment of seeing me eccentric passed, you spoil your type, you try to make me a commonplace man. You want me to be common, vulgar; you ask me for explanations at last. Come now, Mr. Beauchamp, you want to laugh.
088.132 - "However," Beauchamp resumed with hauteur, "there are occasions when probity commands...
088.133 --Monsieur Beauchamp," interrupted the strange man, "what commands the Count of Monte Cristo is the Count of Monte Cristo. So not a word of this, please. I do what I want, Mr. Beauchamp, and, believe me, it is always very well done.
088.134 --Sir, replied the young man, one does not pay honest people with this money; one needs guarantees of honor.
088.135 --Monsieur, I am a living guarantee," said Monte Cristo impassively, but whose eyes were ablaze with threatening flashes. We both have blood in our veins that we want to spill, that is our mutual guarantee. Postpone this answer to the viscount, and tell him that tomorrow, before ten o'clock, I will have seen the color of his.
088.136 --It only remains for me, said Beauchamp, to fix the arrangements for the combat.
088.137 --That is perfectly indifferent to me, sir, said the Count of Monte Cristo; it was therefore useless to come and disturb me at the show for so little. In France, one fights with the sword or the pistol; in the colonies, one takes the rifle; in Arabia, one has the dagger. Tell your client that, although insulted for being eccentric to the end, I leave him the choice of weapons, and that I will accept everything without discussion, without question; everything, do you understand? everything, even the fight by way of fate, which is always stupid. But I'm something else: I'm sure I'll win.
088.138 --Sure to win! repeated Beauchamp, looking at the Count with frightened eyes.
088.139 -- "Certainly," said Monte Cristo, shrugging his shoulders slightly. I would not fight with M. de Morcerf otherwise. I will kill him, I must, that will be. Only, by a word this evening at my house, indicate to me the weapon and the hour; I do not like to be kept waiting.
088.140 --A pistol, at eight o'clock in the morning in the Bois de Vincennes, said Beauchamp, disconcerted, not knowing whether he was dealing with a boastful braggart or a supernatural being.
088.141 -That's fine, sir, said Monte Cristo. Now that everything is settled, let me hear the show, I pray you, and tell your friend Albert not to come back this evening: he would do himself a disservice with all his tasteless brutality. Let him go home and sleep."
088.142 Beauchamp went out quite astonished.
088.143 "Now," said Monte Cristo, turning back to Morrel, "I count on you, don't I?
088.144 --Certainly, said Morrel, and you can dispose of me, Count; however...
088.145 --What?
088.146 -- It would be important, Count, for me to know the real cause...
088.147 -- That is, that you refuse me?
088.148 -- No, not at all.
088.149 --The real cause, Morrel? said the Count; this young man himself walks blind and does not know it. The real cause is known only to me and to God; but I give you my word of honor, Morrel, that God, who knows it, will be for us.
088.150 "That is enough, Count," said Morrel. What is your second witness?
088.151 --I know of no one in Paris to whom I would do this honor but you, Morrel, and your brother-in-law Emmanuel. Do you think Emmanuel would do me this favor?
088.152 -- I answer to you for him, as for me, Count.
088.153 --Good! That's all I need. Tomorrow at seven o'clock in the morning at my house, right?
088.154 -- We'll be there.
088.155 --Hush! Here is the canvas rising, let's listen. I am accustomed not to lose a note of this opera; it is such lovely music as that of _Guillaume Tell_!"
089.000 Night.
089.001 M. de Monte-Cristo waited, as was his habit, until Duprez had sung his famous _Suivez-moi_! and only then did he get up and go out.
089.002 At the door, Morrel left him, renewing his promise to be at his house, with Emmanuel, the next morning at seven o'clock sharp. Then he got into his coupé, still calm and smiling. Five minutes later he was home. Only one would not have known the Count to be deceived by the expression with which he said to Ali on entering:
089.003 "Ali, my ivory-handled pistols!"
089.004 Ali brought the box to his master, and the latter began to examine these weapons with a solicitude quite natural to a man who is going to entrust his life to a bit of iron and lead. They were particular pistols that Monte Cristo had had made for target shooting in his apartments. A capsule was enough to chase the bullet away, and from the room next door one could not have suspected that the Count, as they say in shooting terms, was busy keeping his hand busy.
089.005 He was in the process of fitting the gun in his hand and looking for the point of aim on a small sheet of metal that served as a target, when the door of his study opened and Baptistin entered.
089.006 But before he had even opened his mouth, the Count saw in the door, which had remained open, a veiled woman standing in the half-light of the next room, who had followed Baptistin.
089.007 She had seen the Count with a pistol in his hand, she saw two swords on a table, and she dashed forward.
089.008 Baptistin consulted his master with his eyes. The Count made a sign, Baptistin went out, and closed the door behind him.
089.009 "Who are you, madam?" said the Count to the veiled woman.
089.010 The stranger glanced around to make sure she was alone, then bowed as if she wanted to kneel, and joined her hands in despair:
089.011 "Edmund," she said, "you will not kill my son!"
089.012 The Count took a step backward, gave a feeble cry, and dropped the weapon he was holding.
089.013 "What name did you say, Madame de Morcerf?
089.014 -Yours!" she cried, throwing back her veil, "yours, which perhaps I alone have not forgotten. Edmund, it is not Mme. de Morcerf who is coming to you, it is Mercédès.
089.015 --Mercedes is dead, madam, said Monte Cristo, and I know no one by that name.
089.016 --Mercedes lives, sir, and Mercedes remembers, for she alone recognized you when she saw you, and even without seeing you, by your voice, Edmond, by the mere accent of your voice; and since that time she has followed you step by step, she watches you, she dreads you, and she has not needed to look for the hand from which the blow that struck M. de Morcerf came.
089.017 --Fernand, do you mean, madame," resumed Monte Cristo with bitter irony; "since we are remembering our names, let us remember them all."
089.018 And Monte Cristo had pronounced this name of Fernand with such an expression of hatred, that Mercédès felt the shiver of fright run through her whole body.
089.019 "You see, Edmund, that I was not mistaken!" cried Mercédès, "and that I am right in saying to you: 'Spare my son!
089.020 --And who told you, madam, that I was after your son?
089.021 --No one, my God! But a mother is gifted with double vision. I guessed everything; I followed him this evening to the Opera, and, hidden in a bathtub, I saw everything.
089.022 --So, if you saw everything, madam, you saw that Fernand's son insulted me publicly? said Monte Cristo with terrible calm.
089.023 --Oh! for pity's sake!
089.024 -- You saw, continued the Count, that he would have thrown his glove in my face if one of my friends, M. Morrel, had not stopped his arm.
089.025 -- Listen to me. My son has guessed you too; he attributes to you the misfortunes that befall his father.
089.026 --Madam, said Monte Cristo, you are mistaken: these are not misfortunes, they are a punishment. It is not I who is striking M. de Morcerf, it is Providence which is punishing him.
089.027 --And why do you substitute yourself for Providence? Why do you remember when she forgets? What do you, Edmund, care about Janina and her vizier? What harm has Fernand Mondego done you by betraying Ali-Tebelin?
089.028 - "Also, madam," replied Monte Cristo, "all this is a matter between the Frankish captain and the daughter of Vasiliki. It does not concern me, you are right, and if I have sworn to take revenge, it is not on the Frankish captain, nor on the Count of Morcerf: it is on the sinner Fernand, husband of the Catalan girl Mercédès.
089.029 --Ah, sir!" cried the countess, "what a terrible revenge for a fault that fate has made me commit! For the guilty party is me, Edmond, and if you have to take revenge on anyone, it is me, who has lacked strength against your absence and my isolation.
089.030 -But," cried Monte Cristo, "why was I absent? why were you isolated?
089.031 --Because you were arrested, Edmond, because you were a prisoner.
089.032 --And why was I arrested? Why was I a prisoner?
089.033 -- I don't know," said Mercedes.
089.034 -- Yes, you do not know, madam, I hope so. Well, I'll tell you. I was arrested, I was a prisoner, because under the arbour of the Reserve, on the very eve of the day I was to marry you, a man named Danglars had written this letter which the fisherman Fernand undertook himself to put in the post."
089.035 And Monte Cristo, going to a secretary, opened a drawer, where he took a paper which had lost its original color, and whose ink had become the color of rust, which he placed before the eyes of Mercédès.
089.036 It was the letter from Danglars to the king's prosecutor which, on the day he had paid the two hundred thousand francs to M. de Boville, the Count of Monte Cristo, disguised as an agent of Thomson and French, had removed from Edmond Dantes' file.
089.037 Mercédès read the following lines with fright:
089.038 "Monsieur le procureur du roi is warned, by a friend of the throne and of religion, that the named Edmond Dantes, first mate of the ship _Le Pharaon_, who arrived this morning from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been charged by Murat with a letter for the usurper, and, by the usurper, with a letter for the Bonapartist committee of Paris.
089.039 "We shall have the proof of this crime by arresting him, for we shall find this letter, either on him, or at his father's house, or in his cabin on board the _Pharaon_."
089.040 "Oh, my God!" said Mercedes, passing her hand over her sweaty forehead; "and this letter...
089.041 --I bought it for two hundred thousand francs, madame," said Monte Cristo; "but it is still cheap, since it enables me today to clear myself in your eyes.
089.042 --And the result of this letter?
089.043 -- You know it, madam, was my arrest; but what you don't know, madam, is how long this arrest lasted. What you do not know is that I remained fourteen years at a quarter of a league from you, in a dungeon of the castle of If. What you don't know is that every day of these fourteen years I renewed the vow of vengeance that I had made on the first day, and yet I did not know that you had married Fernand, my informer, and that my father was dead, and dead of hunger!
089.044 --Just God!" exclaimed Mercédès, staggering.
089.045 --But this is what I knew when I got out of prison, fourteen years after I entered it, and this is what made me swear, over Mercedes alive and over my dead father, to take revenge on Fernand, and... and I am taking revenge.
089.046 --And you are sure that the unfortunate Fernand did this?
089.047 -- On my soul, madam, and he did it as I tell you; besides, it is not much more odious than having, French by adoption, passed to the English! A Spaniard by birth, to have fought against the Spaniards; a stipendiary of Ali, to have betrayed and murdered Ali. In the face of such things, what was the letter that you have just read? A gallant mystification that must be forgiven, I confess and understand, by the woman who married this man, but not forgiven by the lover who was to marry her. Well, the French did not avenge themselves on the traitor, the Spaniards did not shoot the traitor, Ali, lying in his grave, let the traitor go unpunished; but I, betrayed, murdered, thrown also into a grave, came out of that grave by the grace of God, I owe it to God to avenge myself; he sends me for that, and here I am."
089.048 The poor woman let her head fall back into her hands; her legs bent under her, and she fell to her knees.
089.049 "Forgive, Edmund," she said, "forgive for my sake, who still loves you!"
089.050 The dignity of the wife stopped the impulse of the lover and mother. Her forehead bowed almost to touch the carpet. The count rushed to meet her and lifted her up. Then, seated on an armchair, she could, through her tears, look at the male face of Monte Cristo, on which pain and hatred still imprinted a menacing character.
089.051 "Let me not crush this accursed race!" he murmured; "let me disobey God, who has raised me up for his punishment! impossible, madame, impossible!
089.052 --Edmond, said the poor mother, trying every means: my God! when I call you Edmond, why don't you call me Mercedes?
089.053 --Mercedes, repeated Monte Cristo, Mercedes! Yes, you are right, that name is still sweet to me to pronounce, and this is the first time in a long time that it has sounded so clearly from my lips. O Mercedes, your name, I have pronounced it with the sighs of melancholy, with the groans of pain, with the rattle of despair; I have pronounced it, frozen by the cold, crouching on the straw of my dungeon; I have pronounced it, devoured by heat, while rolling on the flagstones of my prison. Mercédès, I must take revenge, for fourteen years I have suffered, fourteen years I have wept, I have cursed; now, I tell you, Mercédès, I must take revenge!"
089.054 And the Count, trembling to yield to the prayers of her whom he had loved so much, called upon his memories to the rescue of his hatred.
089.055 "Avenge yourself, Edmund!" cried the poor mother, "but avenge yourself on the guilty; avenge yourself on him, avenge yourself on me, but do not avenge yourself on my son!
089.056 --It is written in the Holy Book, replied Monte Cristo: "The faults of the fathers shall fall on the children to the third and fourth generation." Since God dictated these words to his prophet, why should I be better than God?
089.057 --Because God has time and eternity, those two things which escape men."
089.058 Monte Cristo heaved a sigh that sounded like a roar, and grasped his beautiful hair with his full hands.
089.059 "Edmond," continued Mercédès, with her arms outstretched toward the Count, "Edmond, since I have known you I have adored your name, I have respected your memory. Edmond, my friend, do not force me to hold this noble and pure image reflected unceasingly in the mirror of my heart. Edmond, if you only knew how many prayers I prayed to God for you, as long as I hoped you were alive and since I thought you were dead, yes, dead, alas! I thought your body was buried at the bottom of some dark tower; I thought your body was thrown into one of those abysses where jailers let dead prisoners roll, and I wept! What could I do for you, Edmond, but pray or cry? Listen to me; for ten years I had the same dream every night. It was said that you had wanted to flee, that you had taken the place of a prisoner, that you had slipped into the shroud of a dead man and that the living corpse had been thrown from the top to the bottom of the Château d'If; and that the cry you uttered as you broke on the rocks had alone revealed the substitution to your buriers, who had become your executioners. Well, Edmond, I swear to you on the head of this son for whom I implore you, Edmond, for ten years I have seen every night men who were swinging something formless and unknown on the top of a rock; for ten years I have, every night, heard a terrible cry that woke me up shivering and frozen. And I too, Edmond, oh, believe me, however criminal I was, oh, yes, I too have suffered a great deal.
089.060 -Did you feel your father die in your absence?" exclaimed Monte Cristo, thrusting his hands into his hair; "did you see the woman you loved hold out her hand to your rival, while you grumbled at the bottom of the abyss?
089.061 --No, interrupted Mercedes; but I saw the one I loved ready to become the murderer of my son!"
089.062 Mercedes pronounced these words with such powerful pain, with such a desperate accent, that at these words and at this accent a sob tore the Count's throat.
089.063 The lion was tamed; the avenger was defeated.
089.064 "What do you ask?" he said; "that your son should live? well, he shall live!"
089.065 Mercédès threw out a cry which caused two tears to spring from Monte Cristo's eyelids, but these two tears disappeared almost immediately, for no doubt God had sent some angel to collect them, much more precious than they were in the eyes of the Lord than the richest pearls of Gusarate and Ophir.
089.066 "Oh!" she cried, seizing the Count's hand and bringing it to her lips, "oh, thank you, thank you, Edmund! here you are, just as I have always dreamed, just as I have always loved you. Oh, now I can say it.
089.067 - All the better, replied Monte Cristo, since poor Edmund will not have long to be loved by you. The dead man will return to the grave, the ghost will return to the night.
089.068 -- What do you say, Edmond?
089.069 -- I say that since you order it, Mercedes, we must die.
089.070 --Die! And who is it who says that? Who talks about dying? Where do you get these ideas of death from?
089.071 -- You don't suppose that, outraged publicly, in front of a whole room, in the presence of your friends and those of your son, provoked by a child who will glory in my forgiveness as if it were a victory, you don't suppose, I say, that I have a moment's desire to live. What I have loved most after you, Mercedes, is myself, that is to say my dignity, that is to say that strength which made me superior to other men; that strength was my life. With one word you break it. I die.
089.072 --But this duel will not take place, Edmond, since you forgive.
089.073 --It will take place, madam," said Monte Cristo solemnly, "only instead of the blood of your son, which the earth was to drink, it will be mine that will flow."
089.074 Mercédès uttered a great cry and dashed toward Monte Cristo; but suddenly she stopped.
089.075 "Edmond," she said, "there is a God above us, since you live, since I have seen you again, and I trust in him from the depths of my heart. While waiting for his support, I rest on your word. You said that my son would live; he will live, won't he?
089.076 -- He will live, yes, madam," said Monte Cristo, astonished that, without any other exclamation, without any other surprise, Mercedes had accepted the heroic sacrifice he was making to her.
089.077 Mercedes held out her hand to the Count.
089.078 "Edmund," she said, while her eyes were wet with tears as she looked at the man to whom she was speaking, "how beautiful of you, how great what you have just done, how sublime to have taken pity on a poor woman who was offering herself to you with all the odds against her hopes! Alas! I am aged by sorrow even more than by age, and I can no longer remind my Edmond by a smile, by a look, of that Mercedes that he once spent so many hours contemplating. Ah, believe me, Edmond, I told you that I too had suffered a great deal; I repeat, it is very sad to see one's life pass without remembering a single joy, without preserving a single hope, but this proves that all is not finished on earth. No! all is not finished, I feel it with what still remains in my heart. Oh, I tell you again, Edmond, it is beautiful, it is great, it is sublime to forgive as you have just done!
089.079 -- You say that, Mercedes, and what would you say if you knew the extent of the sacrifice I am making to you? Suppose that the Supreme Master, after having created the world, after having fertilized chaos, had stopped at the third of the creation to spare an angel the tears that our crimes would one day make flow from his immortal eyes; suppose that after having prepared everything, kneaded everything, fertilized everything, at the moment of admiring his work, God had extinguished the sun and pushed the world back with his foot into eternal night, then you will have an idea, or rather no, you will not yet be able to form an idea of what I am losing by losing my life at this moment. "
089.080 Mercédès looked at the Count with an air that painted at once her astonishment, her admiration, and her gratitude.
089.081 Monte Cristo rested his forehead on his burning hands, as if his forehead alone could no longer bear the weight of his thoughts.
089.082 "Edmond," said Mercédès, "I have only one more word to say to you."
089.083 The Count smiled bitterly.
089.084 "Edmund," she continued, "you will see that if my forehead is paled, if my eyes are extinguished, if my beauty is lost, if at last Mercedes no longer resembles herself in facial features, you will see that it is still the same heart!... Farewell then, Edmond; I have nothing more to ask of Heaven... I have seen you again as noble and as great as before. Farewell, Edmond--farewell and thank you!"
089.085 But the Count did not answer.
089.086 Mercedes opened the door of the cabinet, and she had disappeared before he had returned from the painful and deep reverie into which his lost revenge had plunged him.
089.087 One o'clock was striking the clock at the Invalides when the carriage carrying Mme. de Morcerf, as it rolled along the pavement of the Champs-Élysées, made the Count of Monte Cristo raise his head.
089.088 "Fool," he said, "the day I had resolved to take revenge, not to have torn out my heart!"
090.000 The meeting.
090.001 After the departure of Mercédès, all fell again in the shade at Monte Cristo. Around him and within him his thought stopped; his energetic spirit fell asleep as does the body after a supreme fatigue.
090.002 "What!" he said to himself, while the lamp and the candles burned sadly and the servants waited impatiently in the antechamber; "what! here is the edifice so slowly prepared, raised with so much trouble and worry, collapsed at once, with a single word, under a breath! What! this me whom I thought was something, this me of whom I was so proud, this me whom I had seen so small in the dungeons of the Château d'If, and which I had known how to make so great, will tomorrow be a bit of dust! Alas! it is not the death of the body that I regret: is not this destruction of the vital principle the rest to which all tends, to which all unhappy people aspire, this calm of the matter after which I sighed so long, towards which I was going by the painful road of hunger, when Faria appeared in my dungeon? What is death? One step more in the calm and two perhaps in the silence. No, it is not then the existence that I regret, it is the ruin of my projects so slowly elaborated, so laboriously built. Providence, that I had believed for them, was thus against them. God did not want them to be accomplished!
090.003 "This burden which I raised, almost as heavy as a world, and which I had believed to carry to the end, was according to my desire and not according to my strength; according to my will and not according to my power, and it will be necessary for me to deposit it hardly half of my race. Oh! I will become a fatalist again, I whom fourteen years of despair and ten years of hope had made providential.
090.004 "And all this, my God! because my heart, which I thought dead, was only numb; because it woke up, because it beat, because I gave in to the pain of this beating raised from the bottom of my chest by a woman's voice!
090.005 "And yet," continued the Count, sinking deeper and deeper into the predictions of that terrible tomorrow which Mercedes had accepted; "yet it is impossible that this woman, who is such a noble heart, should have thus, out of selfishness, consented to let me, full of strength and existence, be killed! It is impossible that she pushes to this point the love, or rather the maternal delirium! There are virtues whose exaggeration would be a crime. No, she will have imagined some pathetic scene, she will come to throw herself between the swords, and it will be ridiculous on the ground, of sublime that it was here."
090.006 And the blush of pride rose to the Count's forehead.
090.007 "Ridiculous," he repeated, "and the ridicule will reflect on me... Me, ridiculous! Come on! I'd rather die."
090.008 And by dint of thus exaggerating in advance the bad chances of tomorrow, to which he had condemned himself by promising Mercedes to let his son live, the count came to say to himself:
090.009 "Foolishness, foolishness, foolishness! that to make generosity like this by placing oneself as an inert aim at the end of this young man's gun! He will never believe that my death is a suicide, and yet it is important for the honor of my memory... (this is not vanity, is it, my God? but just pride, that's all), it is important for the honor of my memory that the world know that I myself consented, by my will, of my free will, to stop my arm already raised to strike, and that with this arm, so powerfully armed against others, I struck myself: it must, I will."
090.010 And seizing a quill, he drew a paper from the secret cupboard of his office, and traced at the bottom of this paper, which was no other than his will made since his arrival in Paris, a sort of codicil in which he made his death clear to the less clairvoyant.
090.011 "I do this, my God!" he said, his eyes raised to heaven, "as much for your honor as for mine. I have considered myself, for ten years, O my God! as the envoy of your vengeance, and it is not necessary that other wretches than this Morcerf, it is not necessary that a Danglars, a Villefort, it is not necessary that this Morcerf himself should think that chance has rid them of their enemy. Let them know, on the contrary, that Providence, which had already decreed their punishment, has been corrected by the power of my will alone, that the punishment avoided in this world awaits them in the next, and that they have exchanged time only for eternity."
090.012 While he floated between these dark uncertainties, the evil dream of the man awakened by pain, the day came to whiten the windows and to light up under his hands the pale azure paper on which he had just traced this supreme justification of Providence.
090.013 It was five in the morning.
090.014 Suddenly a slight noise reached his ear. Monte Cristo thought he heard something like a muffled sigh; he turned his head, looked around and saw no one. But the noise was repeated distinctly enough for doubt to be replaced by certainty.
090.015 Then the Count got up, opened the door of the living room gently, and on an armchair, his arms hanging down, his beautiful pale head tilted back, he saw Haydée who had placed herself across the door, so that he could not go out without seeing her, but whom sleep, so powerful against youth, had surprised after the weariness of so long a vigil.
090.016 The noise which the door made by opening could not draw Haydée from her sleep.
090.017 Monte Cristo stopped a look full of gentleness and regret on her.
090.018 "She remembered that she had a son," he said, "and I forgot that I had a daughter!
090.019 Then, shaking his head sadly:
090.020 "Poor Haydée!" she said, "she wanted to see me, she wanted to talk to me, she feared or guessed something... Oh! I cannot leave without saying goodbye to her, I cannot die without entrusting her to someone."
090.021 And he slowly returned to his seat and wrote at the bottom of the first lines:
090.022 "I bequeath to Maximilien Morrel, captain of spahis and son of my former boss, Pierre Morrel, shipowner in Marseilles, the sum of twenty millions, part of which he will give to his sister Julie and his brother-in-law Emmanuel, if he does not believe, however, that this surplus of fortune should harm their happiness. These twenty millions are buried in my cave of Monte Cristo, of which Bertuccio knows the secret.
090.023 "If his heart is free and he wants to marry Haydée, daughter of Ali, pasha of Janina, whom I raised with the love of a father and who had for me the tenderness of a daughter, he will fulfill, I will not say my last will, but my last desire.
090.024 "The present will has already made Haydée heiress to the rest of my fortune, consisting of lands, annuities on England, Austria, and Holland, furniture in my various palaces and houses, and which, these twenty millions taken out, together with the various bequests made to my servants, will be able to rise again to sixty millions."
090.025 He was finishing writing this last line, when a cry from behind him knocked the pen out of his hand.
090.026 "Haydée," he said, "have you read?"
090.027 Indeed, the young woman, awakened by the daylight that had struck her eyelids, had risen and approached the Count without her light steps, muffled by the carpet, being heard.
090.028 "Oh, my lord," she said, clasping her hands together, "why do you write like this at such an hour? Why do you leave me all your wealth, my lord? Are you leaving me?
090.029 -- I am going on a journey, dear angel," said Monte Cristo with an expression of infinite melancholy and tenderness, "and if anything should happen to me..."
090.030 The Count paused.
090.031 "Well?" asked the young girl with an accent of authority that the Count did not know and that made him flinch.
090.032 --Well, if anything happens to me," said Monte Cristo, "I want my daughter to be happy.
090.033 Haydée smiled sadly and shook her head.
090.034 "Are you thinking of dying, my lord?" she said.
090.035 --That is a salutary thought, my child, said the sage.
090.036 --Well, if you die," she said, "bequeath your fortune to others, for, if you die... I shall have no further need of anything."
090.037 And taking the paper, she tore it into four pieces which she threw into the middle of the living room. Then, this energy so unaccustomed to a slave having exhausted her strength, she fell, no longer asleep this time, but passed out on the floor.
090.038 Monte Cristo bent over her, lifted her in his arms; and, seeing that beautiful pale complexion, those beautiful closed eyes, that beautiful body inanimate and as if abandoned, the idea came to him for the first time that perhaps she loved him in some other way than as a daughter loves her father.
090.039 "Alas!" he murmured with deep despondency, "I could still have been happy!"
090.040 Then he carried Haydée to his apartment, handed her, still fainting, into the hands of his wives; and, returning to his study, which he this time closed briskly upon, he copied the destroyed will.
090.041 As he finished, the sound of a cabriolet entering the courtyard was heard. Monte Cristo went to the window and saw Maximilian and Emmanuel getting out.
090.042 "Well," he said, "it was time!"
090.043 And he sealed his will with a triple seal.
090.044 A moment later he heard the sound of footsteps in the living room, and went to open the door himself. Morrel appeared on the threshold.
090.045 He had beaten the hour by nearly twenty minutes.
090.046 "Perhaps I have come too early, Monsieur le Comte," he said, "but I confess frankly that I have not been able to sleep for a minute, and that the whole house has been asleep. I needed to see you strong with your courageous assurance to become myself again."
090.047 Monte Cristo could not hold on to this proof of affection, and it was not his hand that he held out to the young man but his two arms that he opened to him.
090.048 "Morrel," he said to him in an emotional voice, "it is a beautiful day for me to feel loved by a man like you. Good morning, Monsieur Emmanuel. Will you come with me, Maximilien?
090.049 -Good heavens!" said the young captain, "did you doubt it?
090.050 -- But if I was wrong...
090.051 --Listen, I looked at you yesterday during that whole scene of provocation, I thought of your assurance all night, and I told myself that justice must be for you, or there was no more background to be done on the faces of men.
090.052 --Dependently, Morrel, Albert is your friend.
090.053 --A mere acquaintance, Count.
090.054 --You saw him for the first time the same day you saw me?
090.055 --Yes, that's true; what do you want? You have to remind me of it so that I remember.
090.056 --Thank you, Morrel."
090.057 Then, striking a blow on the bell:
090.058 "Here," he said to Ali, who appeared at once, "have this taken to my notary. It is my will, Morrel. When I am dead, you will go and read it.
090.059 --How!" cried Morrel, "you dead?
090.060 --Eh! must not everything be foreseen, dear friend? But what did you do yesterday after leaving me?
090.061 -- I went to Tortoni's, where, as I expected, I found Beauchamp and Château-Renaud. I confess that I was looking for them.
090.062 --For what purpose, since all this was agreed upon?
090.063 -- Listen, Count, the matter is serious, unavoidable.
090.064 -- Did you doubt it?
090.065 -- No. The offense was public, and everyone was already talking about it.
090.066 --Well?
090.067 -- Well, I hoped to change the weapons, to substitute the sword for the gun. The pistol is blind.
090.068 --Did you succeed?" asked Monte Cristo sharply, with an imperceptible glimmer of hope.
090.069 -- No, because we know your strength with the sword.
090.070 --Bah! Who has betrayed me?
090.071 --The masters of arms whom you beat.
090.072 --And you failed?
090.073 --They positively refused.
090.074 --Morrel, said the Count, did you ever see me fire the pistol?
090.075 -- Never.
090.076 --Well, we have time, look."
090.077 Monte Cristo took the pistols he had been holding when Mercedes had entered, and sticking an ace of clubs against the plate, in four shots he successively removed the four branches of the clover.
090.078 With each blow Morrel paled.
090.079 He examined the bullets with which Monte Cristo performed this feat of strength, and he saw that they were no bigger than buckshot.
090.080 "That's frightening," he said; "see, Emmanuel!
090.081 Then, turning back to Monte Cristo:
090.082 "Count," he said, "in the name of Heaven, do not kill Albert! the unfortunate man has a mother!
090.083 - "That is right," said Monte Cristo, "and I have none.
090.084 These words were pronounced with a tone that made Morrel shudder.
090.085 "You are the offended one, Count.
090.086 --Surely; what does that mean?
090.087 --It means that you shoot first.
090.088 -- I shoot first?
090.089 -- Oh, I got that, or rather I demanded it; we make enough concessions to them that they make those to us.
090.090 -- And how far away?
090.091 -- Twenty."
090.092 A frightening smile passed over the Count's lips.
090.093 "Morrel," he said, "do not forget what you have just seen.
090.094 -Also," said the young man, "I count only on your emotion to save Albert.
090.095 --Me, moved? said Monte Cristo.
090.096 -- Or on your generosity, my friend; sure of your move as you are, I can tell you a thing which would be ridiculous if I said it to another.
090.097 -What is it?
090.098 --Break his arm, hurt him, but don't kill him.
090.099 --Morrel, listen to this again, said the Count, I need no encouragement to spare M. de Morcerf; M. de Morcerf, I announce to you in advance, will be so well spared that he will return quietly with his two friends while I...
090.100 --Well, you?
090.101 --Oh! that's another thing, I'll be brought back.
090.102 --Let's go!" cried Maximilian, out of temper.
090.103 -- "It is as I tell you, my dear Morrel, M. de Morcerf will kill me."
090.104 Morrel looked at the Count like a man who no longer understood.
090.105 "What has happened to you since last night, Count?
090.106 --What happened to Brutus the day before the battle of Philippi: I saw a ghost.
090.107 --And this ghost?
090.108 --This ghost, Morrel, told me that I had lived long enough."
090.109 Maximilian and Emmanuel looked at each other; Monte Cristo drew his watch.
090.110 "Let us go," he said, "it is five minutes past seven, and the appointment is for eight o'clock just."
090.111 A carriage was waiting, all hitched up; Monte Cristo climbed into it with his two witnesses.
090.112 As he crossed the corridor, Monte Cristo had stopped to listen before a door, and Maximilian and Emmanuel, who, out of discretion, had taken a few steps forward, thought they heard a sob answered by a sigh.
090.113 At the stroke of eight o'clock the appointment was made.
090.114 "Here we are," said Morrel, putting his head through the door, "and we are the first.
090.115 --Monsieur will excuse me, said Baptistin, who had followed his master with unspeakable terror, but I think I see a car over there under the trees.
090.116 --In fact," said Emmanuel, "I see two young men walking about who seem to be waiting."
090.117 Monte Cristo jumped lightly down from his carriage and gave his hand to Emmanuel and Maximilian to help them down.
090.118 Maximilian held the Count's hand between his own.
090.119 "By golly," he said, "here is a hand such as I like to see to a man whose life rests in the goodness of his cause."
090.120 Monte Cristo pulled Morrel, not aside, but a step or two behind his brother-in-law.
090.121 "Maximilian," he asked him, "have you a free heart?"
090.122 Morrel looked at Monte Cristo in astonishment.
090.123 "I am not asking you for a confidence, dear friend, I am addressing a simple question to you; answer yes or no, that is all I ask.
090.124 --I love a young girl, Count.
090.125 -- You love her very much?
090.126 --More than my life.
090.127 --Come on, said Monte Cristo, here is another hope that escapes me."
090.128 Then, with a sigh:
090.129 "Poor Haydée!" he murmured.
090.130 --In truth, Count!" cried Morrel, "if I knew you less, I would believe you less brave than you are!
090.131 --Because I think of someone I am going to leave, and I sigh! Come now, Morrel, is it for a soldier to know so little about courage? Is it life that I regret? What does it matter to me, who has spent twenty years between life and death, to live or to die? Besides, rest assured, Morrel, this weakness, if it is one, is for you alone. I know that the world is a salon from which one must leave politely and honestly, that is to say, by bowing and paying one's gambling debts.
090.132 -- "That's a good thing," said Morrel, "that's what I mean. By the way, did you bring your weapons?
090.133 --Me! What for? I hope the gentlemen will have theirs.
090.134 --I'll find out, said Morrel.
090.135 -- Yes, but no negotiations, do you hear me?
090.136 --Oh, be quiet."
090.137 Morrel advanced toward Beauchamp and Château-Renaud. The latter, seeing Maximilian's movement, took a few steps in front of him.
090.138 The three young men greeted each other, if not affably, at least courteously.
090.139 "Pardon, gentlemen," said Morrel, "but I do not see M. de Morcerf!
090.140 - "This morning," replied Château-Renaud, "he made us warn him that he would join us only on the field.
090.141 --Ah!" said Morrel.
090.142 Beauchamp pulled out his watch.
090.143 "Eight hours and five minutes; there is no time to lose, Monsieur Morrel," he said.
090.144 --Oh!" replied Maximilian, "I didn't mean to say that.
090.145 - "Besides," interrupted Château-Renaud, "here is a carriage."
090.146 Indeed, a carriage was advancing at a high trot along one of the avenues leading to the crossroads where we were.
090.147 "Gentlemen," said Morrel, "no doubt you have provided yourselves with pistols. M. de Monte Cristo declared that he renounced his right to use his own.
090.148 -- "We foresaw this delicacy on the part of the count, Monsieur Morrel," replied Beauchamp, "and I have brought weapons, which I bought eight or ten days ago, believing that I would need them for an affair like this. They are perfectly new and have never been used by anyone. Would you like to see them?
090.149 -- "Oh, Monsieur Beauchamp," said Morrel, bowing, "when you assure me that M. de Morcerf does not know these weapons, you think, do you not, that your word is sufficient for me?
090.150 "Gentlemen," said Château-Renaud, "it was not Morcerf who came to us in that carriage, it was, my goodness! it was Franz and Debray."
090.151 Indeed, the two young men announced came forward.
090.152 "You here, gentlemen!" said Château-Renaud, exchanging handshakes with each one; "and by what chance?
090.153 --Because, said Debray, Albert made us request this morning to be on the field."
090.154 Beauchamp and Château-Renaud looked at each other in astonishment.
090.155 "Gentlemen," said Morrel, "I think I understand.
090.156 --Let's see!
090.157 --Yesterday, in the afternoon, I received a letter from M. de Morcerf, who asked me to be at the Opera.
090.158 --And I too," said Debray.
090.159 --And so am I, said Franz.
090.160 --And us too, said Château-Renaud and Beauchamp.
090.161 --He wanted you to be present at the provocation, said Morrel, he wants you to be present at the combat.
090.162 --Yes, said the young men, that's right, Monsieur Maximilien; and, in all probability, you have guessed right.
090.163 --But, with all that, murmured Château-Renaud, Albert is not coming; he is ten minutes late.
090.164 -- There he is, said Beauchamp, he is on horseback; look, he is coming belly down followed by his servant.
090.165 -- What imprudence, said Château-Renaud, to come on horseback to fight with a gun! I who had taught him so well!
090.166 --And then, see, said Beauchamp, with a collar on his tie, with an open suit of clothes, with a white vest; why didn't he have a fly drawn on his stomach right away? it would have been simpler and sooner finished!"
090.167 Meanwhile, Albert had come within ten paces of the group formed by the five young men; he stopped his horse, jumped to the ground, and threw the bridle on the arm of his servant.
090.168 Albert approached. He was pale, his eyes were reddened and swollen. One could see that he had not slept a second all night. There was, spread over his whole physiognomy, a shade of sad gravity that was not usual for him.
090.169 "Thank you, gentlemen," he said, "for having been kind enough to accept my invitation: believe that I am most grateful for this mark of friendship."
090.170 Morrel, at Morcerf's approach, had taken about ten steps back and was standing aside.
090.171 "And to you too, Monsieur Morrel," said Albert, "my thanks belong to you. Come closer, you are not too much.
090.172 --Monsieur, said Maximilien, perhaps you do not know that I am the witness for M. de Monte Cristo?
090.173 -- I was not sure, but I suspected it. So much the better, the more men of honor there are here, the more satisfied I will be.
090.174 --Monsieur Morrel," said Château-Renaud, "you may announce to M. le Comte de Monte-Cristo that M. de Morcerf has arrived, and that we stand at his disposal."
090.175 Morrel made a movement to discharge his commission. Beauchamp, at the same time, drew the box of pistols from the car.
090.176 "Wait, gentlemen," said Albert, "I have two words to say to the Count of Monte Cristo.
090.177 --In particular?" asked Morrel.
090.178 --No, sir, in front of everyone."
090.179 Albert's witnesses looked at each other in surprise; Franz and Debray exchanged a few words in a low voice, and Morrel, joyful at this unexpected incident, went to look for the Count, who was walking in a side alley with Emmanuel.
090.180 "What does he want with me?" asked Monte Cristo.
090.181 --I don't know, but he asks to speak to you.
090.182 --Oh!" said Monte Cristo, "may he not tempt God with some new outrage!
090.183 --I do not believe that is his intention," said Morrel.
090.184 The Count came forward, accompanied by Maximilian and Emmanuel: his calm and serene face was in strange contrast to the upset face of Albert, who was approaching, followed by the four young men.
090.185 Three steps apart, Albert and the Count stopped.
090.186 "Gentlemen," said Albert, "come closer; I desire that not a word of what I am going to have the honor of saying to M. the Count of Monte Cristo be lost; for what I am going to have the honor of saying to him must be repeated by you to whoever wants to hear it, no matter how strange my speech may seem to you.
090.187 --I am waiting, sir," said the Count.
090.188 "Sir," said Albert, in a voice which at first trembled, but which became more and more assured; "sir, I reproached you for having divulged the conduct of M. de Morcerf in Epirus; for, however guilty M. le Comte de Morcerf may have been, I did not believe that it was you who had the right to punish him. But today, sir, I know that this right is yours. It is not the treason of Fernand Mondego towards Ali-Pacha that makes me so quick to excuse you, it is the treason of the sinner Fernand towards you, it is the unheard of misfortunes that have followed this treason. So I say it, so I proclaim it aloud: yes, sir, you were right to take revenge on my father, and I, his son, thank you for not having done more!"
090.189 Lightning, falling in the midst of the spectators of this unexpected scene, would not have surprised them more than this declaration of Albert.
090.190 As for Monte Cristo, his eyes had slowly risen to heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude, and he could not sufficiently admire how this fiery nature of Albert's, whose courage he had known well enough in the midst of the Roman bandits, had suddenly yielded to this sudden humiliation. So he recognized the influence of Mercedes, and understood how that noble heart had not opposed the sacrifice which she knew in advance would be useless.
090.191 "Now, sir," said Albert, "if you think the apology I have just made is sufficient, your hand, I beg you. After the rare merit of infallibility which seems to be yours, the first of all merits, in my opinion, is to know how to confess one's wrongs. But this admission is my own business. I acted well according to men, but you acted well according to God. An angel alone could save one of us from death, and the angel came down from heaven, if not to make of us two friends, alas! fate makes it impossible, but at least two men who value each other."
090.192 Monte Cristo, his eye moist, his chest panting, his mouth half-open, held out to Albert a hand which the latter seized and pressed with a feeling that resembled respectful awe.
090.193 "Gentlemen," he said, "Monsieur de Monte Cristo will accept my apologies. I had acted hastily towards him. haste is a bad advisor: I had acted badly. Now my fault is repaired. I hope that the world will not consider me a coward because I did what my conscience ordered me to do. But, in any case, if they were mistaken about me," added the young man, raising his head with pride and as if he were addressing a challenge to his friends and enemies, "I would try to straighten out the opinions.
090.194 --What happened last night?" asked Beauchamp of Château-Renaud; "it seems to me that we are playing a sad role here.
090.195 -- Indeed, what Albert has just done is either very wretched or very beautiful, replied the baron.
090.196 --Ah! let us see, asked Debray to Franz, what does that mean? I am not sure that I can do anything about it, but I am not sure that I can do anything about it. But, if I had ten Janinas in my family, I would believe myself obliged to do only one thing, and that would be to fight ten times."
090. 197 As for Monte Cristo, his forehead bent, his arms inert, crushed under the weight of twenty-four years of memories, he was thinking neither of Albert, nor of Beauchamp, nor of Château-Renaud, nor of anyone else who was there: he was thinking of this brave woman who had come to ask him for the life of her son, to whom he had offered his own, and who had just saved her by the terrible confession of a family secret, capable of killing forever in this young man the feeling of filial piety.
090.198 "Always Providence!" he murmured: "ah! it is from today only that I am quite certain to be the envoy of God!"
091.000 The mother and the son.
091.001 The Count of Monte Cristo greeted the five young people with a smile full of melancholy and dignity, and climbed back into his car with Maximilien and Emmanuel.
091.002 Albert, Beauchamp and Château-Renaud remained alone on the battlefield.
091.003 The young man fixed on his two witnesses a glance which, without being shy, seemed nevertheless to ask their opinion on what had just happened.
091.004 "My goodness! my dear friend," said Beauchamp the first, "whether he had more sensitivity or less dissimulation, allow me to congratulate you: here is a very unexpected outcome to a very unpleasant affair.
091.005 Albert remained mute and concentrated in his reverie. Château-Renaud merely beat his boot with his flexible cane.
091.006 "Aren't we leaving?" he said after this embarrassing silence.
091.007 --When you please," replied Beauchamp; "just give me time to compliment M. de Morcerf; he has shown today such a chivalrous generosity... so rare!
091.008 --Oh! yes, said Château-Renaud.
091.009 --That is magnificent, continued Beauchamp, to be able to preserve such a great empire over oneself!
091.010 --Assuredly: as for me, I would have been incapable of it, said Château-Renaud with a most significant coldness.
091.011 - "Gentlemen," interrupted Albert, "I don't think you have understood that between Mr. de Monte Cristo and me something very serious has happened...
091.012 -So done, so done, said Beauchamp at once, but all our onlookers would not be within reach of understanding your heroism, and, sooner or later, you would be forced to explain it to them more energetically than is convenient for the health of your body and the duration of your life. Do you want me to give you a friendly advice? Leave for Naples, The Hague or St. Petersburg, calm countries, where one is more intelligent about the point of honor than in our burnt-out Parisian brains. Once there, make quite a few flies with a pistol, and infinitely many counters to quarte and counters to tierce; make yourself forgotten enough to return peacefully to France in a few years, or respectable enough, as far as academic exercises are concerned, to conquer your tranquility. Is it not true, Monsieur de Château-Renaud, that I am right?
091.013 -That is perfectly my opinion, said the gentleman. Nothing calls for serious duels like a duel without result.
091.014 --Thank you, gentlemen, answered Albert with a cold smile; I will follow your advice, not because you give it to me, but because my intention was to leave France. I thank you also for the service you have rendered me by serving as witnesses. It is very deeply engraved in my heart, since, after the words I have just heard, I remember only him."
091.015 Château-Renaud and Beauchamp looked at each other. The impression was the same on both of them, and the accent with which Morcerf had just pronounced his thanks was imbued with such resolution, that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued.
091.016 "Good-bye, Albert," said Beauchamp suddenly, carelessly extending his hand to the young man, without the latter appearing to come out of his lethargy.
091.017 Indeed, he did not respond to the offer of this hand.
091.018 "Farewell," said Chateau-Renaud in turn, keeping his little cane in his left hand and waving with his right hand.
091.019 Albert's lips barely whispered, "Farewell!" His look was more explicit; it contained a whole poem of contained anger, of proud disdain, of generous indignation.
091.020 When his two witnesses had climbed back into the carriage, he kept his motionless and melancholy pose for some time; then suddenly, unhitching his horse from the little tree around which his servant had tied the bridle, he jumped lightly into the saddle, and took the road to Paris at a gallop. A quarter of an hour later, he returned to the hotel in the rue du Helder.
091.021 While getting off the horse, it seemed to him, behind the curtain of the bedroom of the count, to see the pale face of his father; Albert turned away the head with a sigh and returned in his small house.
091.022 Arrived there, he threw a last glance on all these richnesses which had made him the life so soft and so happy since his childhood; he looked once again at these tables, whose figures seemed to smile to him, and whose landscapes seemed to be animated of alive colors.
091.023 Then he removed the portrait of his mother from its oak frame, which he rolled up, leaving the golden frame around it empty and black.
091. 024 Then he put in order his beautiful Turkish weapons, his beautiful English rifles, his Japanese porcelains, his mounted cups, his artistic bronzes, signed Feuchères or Barye, visited the cupboards and placed the keys with each one of them; threw in a drawer of his secretary which he left open, all the pocket money which he had on him, joined to it the thousand jewels of imagination which populated his cups, his cases, his shelves; made an exact and precise inventory of all, and placed this inventory at the most apparent place of a table, after having cleared this table of the books and papers which encumbered it.
091.025 At the beginning of this work, his servant in spite of the order that Albert had given him to leave him alone, had entered his room.
091.026 "What do you want?" asked Morcerf in an accent more sad than angry.
091.027 --Pardon, sir," said the valet de chambre, "monsieur had forbidden me to disturb him, it is true, but M. le comte de Morcerf sent for me.
091.028 --Well?" asked Albert.
091.029 --I did not want to go to the Count's house without taking his orders.
091.030 --Why not?
091.031 --Because His Lordship undoubtedly knows that I accompanied him to the field.
091.032 --That is probable, said Albert.
091.033 --And if he asks me, it is probably to question me about what happened there. What should I answer?
091.034 --The truth.
091.035 --Then I will say that the meeting did not take place!
091.036 --You will say that I apologized to Mr. Count of Monte Cristo, come on."
091.037 The valet bowed and left.
091.038 Albert then went back to his inventory.
091.039 As he finished this work, the sound of horses trampling in the courtyard and the wheels of a carriage shaking the windows caught his attention, he approached the window, and saw his father get into his carriage and drive off.
091.040 No sooner had the door of the hotel closed behind the Count, than Albert went to his mother's apartment, and as no one was there to announce him, he entered Mercedes' room, and, his heart swelling from what he saw and guessed, he stopped on the threshold.
091.041 As if the same soul had animated these two bodies, Mercedes did at home what Albert had just done at home. Everything was put in order: the laces, the ornaments, the jewels, the linen, the money, were going to be arranged at the bottom of the drawers, of which the countess carefully assembled the keys.
091.042 Albert saw all these preparations; he understood them, and crying out: "My mother!" he went to throw his arms around Mercedes' neck.
091.043 The painter who could have rendered the expression of these two figures would certainly have made a beautiful picture.
091.044 Indeed, all this apparatus of energetic resolution, which had not frightened Albert for himself, frightened him for his mother.
091.045 "What are you doing?" he asked.
091.046 --What were you doing?" she replied.
091.047 --O my mother!" cried Albert, moved to the point of being unable to speak, "it is not you as it is me! No, you cannot have resolved what I have decided, for I have come to warn you that I am saying good-bye to your house, and--and to you.
091.048 "Me too, Albert," replied Mercedes; "I too am going. I had counted, I confess, that my son would accompany me; was I mistaken?
091.049 -My mother," said Albert firmly, "I cannot share with you the fate I have in mind: I must live from now on without a name or fortune; I must, to begin the apprenticeship of this harsh existence, borrow from a friend the bread that I will eat from here until I earn another. So, my good mother, I am going to Franz's house right now to ask him to lend me the small amount of money I have calculated I will need.
091.050 -You, my poor child! cried Mercedes; you suffer misery, suffer hunger! Oh, don't say that, you will break all my resolutions.
091.051 -But not mine, mother," answered Albert. I am young, I am strong, I believe I am brave, and since yesterday I have learned what the will can do. Alas, my mother, there are people who have suffered so much, and who not only have not died, but who have built a new fortune on the ruin of all the promises of happiness that heaven had given them, on the debris of all the hopes that God had given them! I have learned this, my mother, I have seen these men; I know that from the depths of the abyss into which their enemy had plunged them, they have risen with such vigor and glory, that they have dominated their former conqueror and precipitated him in his turn. No, my mother, no; I have broken with the past from this day forward, and I accept nothing more of it, not even my name, because you understand that, don't you, my mother? your son cannot bear the name of a man who must blush before another man!
091.052 - "Albert, my child," said Mercedes, "if I had had a stronger heart, that is the advice I would have given you; your conscience spoke when my voice was silent; listen to your conscience, my son. You had friends, Albert, break momentarily with them, but do not despair, in the name of your mother! Life is still beautiful at your age, my dear Albert, for you are barely twenty-two years old; and as a pure heart like yours needs a name without stain, take my father's: his name was Herrera. I know you, my Albert; whatever career you follow, you will make this name famous in a short time. Then, my friend, reappear in the world even more brilliant of your past misfortunes; and if that should not be so, in spite of all my forecasts, leave me at least this hope, to me who will have only this one thought, to me who has no more future, and for whom the grave begins at the threshold of this house.
091.053 -- I will do as you wish, my mother, said the young man; yes, I share your hope: the wrath of heaven will not pursue us, you so pure, I so innocent. But since we are resolved, let us act promptly. I am not sure that I have the right to say anything, but I am not sure that I have the right to say anything at all, and I am not sure that I have the right to say anything at all.
091.054 --I am waiting for you, my son," said Mercedes.
091.055 Albert ran at once to the boulevard, from where he brought back a carriage which was to lead them out of the hotel; he remembered a certain small furnished house in the rue des Saints-Pères, where his mother would find a modest, but decent lodging; he thus returned to seek the countess.
091.056 Just as the carriage stopped at the door, and as Albert was getting out, a man approached him and handed him a letter.
091.057 Albert recognized the intendant.
091.058 "From the Count", said Bertuccio.
091.059 Albert took the letter, opened it and read it.
091.060 After reading it, he looked for Bertuccio with his eyes, but while the young man was reading, Bertuccio had disappeared.
091.061 Then Albert, with tears in his eyes and his chest swollen with emotion, went back to Mercedes and, without saying a word, presented her with the letter.
091.062 Mercedes read:
091.063 "Albert,
091.064 "By showing you that I have penetrated the project to which you are about to abandon yourself, I believe I am also showing you that I understand delicacy. Here you are free, you are leaving the Count's hotel, and you are going to retire to your mother's house, free as you are; but, think about it, Albert, you owe her more than you can pay her, poor noble heart that you are. Keep for yourself the struggle, claim for yourself the suffering, but spare her that first misery which will inevitably accompany your first efforts; for she does not deserve even the reflection of the misfortune which now befalls her, and Providence does not want the innocent to pay for the guilty.
091.065 "I know that you are both going to leave the house in the Rue du Helder without taking anything with you. Don't try to find out how I found out. I know it, that's all.
091.066 "Listen, Albert.
091.067 "Twenty-four years ago, I returned to my homeland very happy and very proud. I had a fiancée, Albert, a holy young girl whom I adored, and I brought back to my fiancée one hundred and fifty louis, painstakingly amassed by tireless work. This money was for her, I intended it for her, and knowing how treacherous the sea is, I had buried our treasure in the small garden of the house that my father lived in Marseille, on the Allées de Meilhan.
091.068 "Your mother, Albert, knows this poor dear house well.
091.069 "Recently, on my way to Paris, I passed through Marseille. I went to see this house of painful memories; and in the evening, with a spade in my hand, I probed the corner where I had buried my treasure. The iron cassette was still in the same place, nobody had touched it; it is in the corner that a beautiful fig tree, planted by my father the day of my birth, covers with its shade.
091.070 "Well, Albert, this money that was once supposed to help the life and tranquility of this woman whom I adored, now, by a strange and painful chance, it has found the same use. Oh, understand my thought well, to me who could offer millions to this poor woman, and who only gives her back the piece of black bread forgotten under my poor roof since the day I was separated from the one I loved.
091.071 "You are a generous man, Albert, but perhaps you are nevertheless blinded by pride or resentment; if you refuse me, if you ask of another what I have a right to offer you, I shall say that it is ungenerous of you to refuse your mother's life offered by a man whose father your father had died in the horrors of hunger and despair."
091.072 When this reading was finished, Albert remained pale and motionless, waiting for what his mother would decide.
091.073 Mercédès raised to the sky a glance of an ineffable expression.
091.074 "I accept," she said; "he has the right to pay the dowry that I will take to a convent!"
091.075 And, putting the letter on her heart, she took her son's arm, and with a firmer step than she perhaps expected herself, she took the way to the stairs.
092.000 The suicide.
092.001 However, Monte Cristo, too, had returned to the city with Emmanuel and Maximilian.
092.002 The return was cheerful. Emmanuel did not conceal his joy at having seen peace succeed war, and confessed his philanthropic tastes. Morrel, in a corner of the car, let his brother-in-law's gaiety evaporate into words, and kept for himself a joy that was just as sincere, but which shone only in his eyes.
092.003 At the barrier of the Throne, one met Bertuccio: he was waiting there, motionless like a sentry at his post.
092.004 Monte Cristo put his head through the door, exchanged a few words with him in a low voice, and the steward disappeared.
092.005 "Monsieur le Comte," said Emmanuel, as he reached the Place Royale, "have me thrown out, I pray you, at my door, so that my wife may not have a single moment's worry either for you or for me.
092.006 -If it were not ridiculous to go and show off one's triumph, said Morrel, I would invite M. le Comte to come in to our house, but M. le Comte also undoubtedly has trembling hearts to reassure. We have arrived, Emmanuel, let us greet our friend, and let him continue on his way.
092.007 -- One moment, said Monte Cristo, do not deprive me of my two companions at once; go back to your charming wife, to whom I charge you to present all my compliments, and accompany me to the Champs-Élysées, Morrel.
092.008 -- Wonderful, said Maximilien, especially since I have business in your neighborhood, Count.
092.009 -Will they wait for you for lunch? asked Emmanuel.
092.010 --No," said the young man.
092.011 The door closed and the car continued on its way.
092.012 "See how I have brought you luck," said Morrel when he was alone with the Count. Didn't you think of that?
092.013 - "Yes," said Monte Cristo, "that is why I always want to keep you close to me.
092.014 --It is miraculous! continued Morrel, answering his own thought.
092.015 --What is it?" said Monte Cristo.
092.016 --What just happened.
092.017 --Yes, replied the Count with a smile; you have said the word, Morrel, it is miraculous!
092.018 --For, finally, Morrel continued, Albert is brave.
092.019 --Very brave, said Monte Cristo, I saw him sleeping with his dagger hanging over his head.
092.020 --And I know that he has fought twice, and very well, said Morrel; so reconcile that with the conduct of this morning.
092.021 -- "Your influence, always," said Monte Cristo, smiling.
092.022 -It is fortunate for Albert that he is not a soldier, said Morrel.
092.023 --Why is that?
092.024 --Apologies on the field!" said the young captain, shaking his head.
092.025 --Come on, said the Count gently, are you not going to fall into the prejudices of ordinary men, Morrel? Will you not agree that since Albert is brave, he cannot be a coward; that he must have had some reason for acting as he did this morning, and that therefore his conduct is rather heroic than anything else?
092.026 -- No doubt, no doubt," replied Morrel, "but I will say as the Spaniard did: he was less brave today than yesterday.
092.027 -- You are having lunch with me, aren't you, Morrel?" said the Count to cut short the conversation.
092.028 --No, I'm leaving at ten o'clock.
092.029 --So your appointment was for lunch?"
092.030 Morrel smiled and shook his head.
092.031 "But, finally, do you always have to have lunch somewhere?
092.032 --Do you mean if I'm not hungry?" said the young man.
092.033 --Oh!" said the Count, "I know of only two feelings that cut off the appetite in this way: grief (and as fortunately I see you are very cheerful, it is not that) and love. Now, from what you have told me about your heart, I am allowed to believe...
092.034 - "My goodness, Count," replied Morrel cheerfully, "I do not say no.
092.035 --And you don't tell me this, Maximilien?" continued the Count in a tone so lively that one could see how much interest he would have taken in knowing this secret.
092.036 --I showed you this morning that I had a heart, did I not, Count?"
092.037 For all answer Monte Cristo held out his hand to the young man.
092.038 "Well," continued the latter, "since this heart is no longer with you in the Bois de Vincennes, it is somewhere else where I will find it.
092.039 -Go," said the Count slowly, "go, dear friend, but by grace, if you should experience any obstacle, remember that I have some power in this world, that I am happy to use this power for the benefit of the people I love, and that I love you, Morrel.
092.040 -Well, said the young man, I will remember that as selfish children remember their parents when they need them. When I need you, and perhaps that time will come, I will turn to you, Count.
092.041 -Well, I'll keep your word. Farewell then.
092.042 --Bye."
092.043 They had arrived at the door of the house on the Champs-Élysées, Monte-Cristo opened the door. Morrel jumped onto the pavement.
092.044 Bertuccio was waiting on the stoop.
092.045 Morrel disappeared down the Avenue de Marigny and Monte Cristo walked briskly to meet Bertuccio.
092.046 "Well?" he asked.
092.047 -- Well," replied the intendant, "she is going to leave her house.
092.048 --And her son?
092.049 --Florentin, her valet, thinks he will do the same.
092.050 -- Come."
092.051 Monte Cristo took Bertuccio into his study, wrote the letter we have seen, and handed it to the intendant.
092.052 "Go," he said, "and make haste; by the way, send word to Haydée that I have returned.
092.053 -Here I am," said the girl, who, at the sound of the carriage, had already dismounted, and whose face beamed with joy at seeing the Count safe and sound again.
092.054 Bertuccio went out.
092.055 All the excitement of a daughter seeing her beloved father again, all the delirium of a mistress seeing her beloved lover again, Haydée experienced during the first moments of this return, which she had been waiting for with such impatience.
092.056 Certainly, to be less expansive, the joy of Monte Cristo was not less great; joy for hearts that have long suffered is like dew for land parched by the sun; heart and land absorb this beneficent rain that falls on them, and nothing of it appears outside. For some days Monte Cristo had understood something that for a long time he had not dared to believe: that there were two Mercedesses in the world, that he could still be happy.
092.057 His eyes, burning with happiness, were plunging greedily into Haydée's wet eyes, when suddenly the door opened. The Count frowned.
092.058 "M. de Morcerf!" said Baptistin, as if this word alone contained his excuse.
092.059 Indeed, the Count's face lit up.
092.060 "Which," he asked, "the viscount or the count?
092.061 --The Count.
092.062 --My God!" cried Haydée, "is it not over yet?
092.063 -- I don't know if it's over, my beloved child," said Monte Cristo, taking the girl's hands, "but what I do know is that you have nothing to fear.
092.064 -- Oh, it is the wretch, however...
092.065 --That man can do nothing to me, Haydée, said Monte Cristo; it was when I was dealing with his son that I had to fear.
092.066 --And what I have suffered, said the girl, you will never know, my lord."
092.067 Monte Cristo smiled.
092.068 "By my father's grave!" said Monte Cristo, stretching out his hand on the girl's head, "I swear to you that if anything bad happens, it will not be to me.
092.069 --I believe you, my lord, as if God were speaking to me," said the girl, presenting her forehead to the count.
092.070 Monte Cristo placed on this forehead, so pure and so beautiful, a kiss that made two hearts beat at once, one with violence, the other deafly.
092.071 "Oh, my God!" murmured the Count, "would you allow me to love again! Show M. le Comte de Morcerf into the salon," he said to Baptistin, while leading the beautiful Greek towards a hidden staircase.
092.072 A word of explanation about this visit, expected perhaps by Monte Cristo, but unexpected no doubt by our readers.
092.073 While Mercedes, as we have said, was making the sort of inventory in her house that Albert had made in his; while she was sorting out her jewels, closing her drawers, gathering her keys, so as to leave everything in perfect order, she had not noticed that a pale and sinister head had come to appear in the window of a door that let the daylight into the corridor; from there, not only could one see, but one could hear. The one who looked thus, in all probability, without being seen or heard, thus saw and heard everything that was happening at Madame de Morcerf's.
092.074 From this glass door, the pale-faced man went to the Count de Morcerf's bedroom, and, when he arrived there, lifted the curtain of a window overlooking the courtyard with a contracted hand. He remained there ten minutes thus immobile, mute, listening to the beating of his own heart. For him it was a long time, ten minutes.
092.075 It was then that Albert, returning from his appointment, saw his father, who was watching for his return behind a curtain and turned his head away.
092.076 The Count's eyes widened: he knew that Albert's insult to Monte Cristo had been terrible, that such an insult, in every country in the world, led to a duel to the death. Now Albert had returned safe and sound, so the Count was avenged.
092.077 A flash of unspeakable joy illuminated that gloomy face, as does a last ray of sunlight before it is lost in the clouds that seem less his bed than his tomb.
092.078 But, as we have said, he waited in vain for the young man to go up to his apartment to give him an account of his triumph. That his son, before fighting, did not want to see the father whose honor he was going to avenge, is understandable; but, the honor of the father avenged, why did this son not come to throw himself into his arms?
092.079 It was then that the count, unable to see Albert, sent for his servant. It is known that Albert had authorized him not to hide anything from the Count.
092.080 Ten minutes later General de Morcerf appeared on the stoop, dressed in a black frock coat, with a military collar, black pants, and black gloves. He had given, it seems, previous orders; for, as soon as he had touched the last step of the staircase, his carriage, fully harnessed, came out of the shed and stopped in front of him.
092.081 His valet then came and threw into the carriage a military capan, stiffened by the two swords it wrapped around it; then closing the door, he sat down next to the coachman.
092.082 The coachman leaned out in front of the carriage to ask for the order:
092.083 "To the Champs-Élysées," said the general, "to the Count of Monte Cristo. Quickly!"
092.084 The horses leaped under the whip that enveloped them; five minutes later they stopped in front of the Count's house.
092.085 M. de Morcerf opened the door himself, and, the carriage still running, he jumped like a young man into the side street, rang the bell, and disappeared through the gaping door with his servant.
092.086 A second later, Baptistin announced the Count de Morcerf to M. de Monte Cristo, and Monte Cristo, leading Haydée out, gave the order for the Count de Morcerf to be brought into the salon.
092.087 The general was pacing the length of the salon for the third time, when, turning around, he saw Monte Cristo standing on the threshold.
092.088 "Eh! it's Monsieur de Morcerf," said Monte Cristo quietly; "I thought I had heard wrong.
092.089 --Yes, it is myself," said the Count with a frightful contraction of the lips that prevented him from articulating clearly.
092.090 --It only remains for me to know now," said Monte Cristo, "the cause which gives me the pleasure of seeing Monsieur le Comte de Morcerf so early.
092.091 --You had a meeting this morning with my son, sir? said the general.
092.092 --Did you know that? replied the count.
092.093 --And I also know that my son had good reasons for wanting to fight you and do everything he could to kill you.
092.094 -- Indeed, sir, he had very good reasons! But you see that, in spite of these reasons, he did not kill me, and even that he did not fight.
092.095 --And yet he looked upon you as the cause of his father's disgrace, as the cause of the appalling ruin which, at this moment, overwhelms my house.
092.096 --That is true, sir," said Monte Cristo with his terrible calm; "a secondary cause, for example, and not the principal one.
092.097 --Surely you have made some excuse or given some explanation?
092.098 -- I gave him no explanation, and it was he who made the excuses.
092.099 --But to what do you attribute this conduct?
092.100 -- To the conviction, probably, that there was a man in all this more guilty than I.
092.101 --And who was this man?
092.102 --His father.
092.103 --So be it, said the Count, turning pale; but you know that the guilty do not like to be convinced of their guilt.
092.104 --I know... So I expected what is happening now.
092.105 --You expected my son to be a coward!
092.106 --M. Albert de Morcerf is not a coward," said Monte Cristo.
092.107 - "A man who holds a sword in his hand, a man who, within reach of that sword, holds a mortal enemy, that man, if he does not fight, is a coward! Why isn't he here so that I can tell him so!
092.108 "Sir," replied Monte Cristo coldly, "I do not presume that you have come to find me to tell me your little family affairs. Go and tell that to Mr. Albert, perhaps he will know what to say.
092.109 --Oh, no, no," replied the general with a smile that vanished as soon as it had blossomed, "no, you are right, I did not come for that! I have come to tell you that I, too, regard you as my enemy! I have come to tell you that I hate you instinctively, that it seems to me that I have always known you, always hated you! And that finally, since the young people of this century no longer fight, it is up to us to fight... Is that your opinion, sir?
092.110 --Perfectly. So when I told you that I had foreseen what was happening to me, it was the honor of your visit that I meant.
092.111 --That's good... are your preparations done, then?
092.112 --They are always made, sir.
092.113 --You know that we will fight until the death of one of us? said the general, his teeth clenched with rage.
092.114 --Until the death of one of us," repeated the Count of Monte Cristo, making a slight up and down movement of his head.
092.115 --Let's go then, we don't need witnesses.
092.116 -- Indeed, said Monte Cristo, it is unnecessary, we know each other so well!
092.117 --On the contrary, said the Count, it is that we do not know each other.
092.118 --Bah!" said Monte Cristo with the same desperate phlegm, "let's see. I am not the soldier Fernand who deserted on the eve of the battle of Waterloo? Aren't you the lieutenant Fernand who served as guide and spy to the French army in Spain? Aren't you the colonel Fernand who betrayed, sold, murdered his benefactor Ali? And didn't all these Fernands together make the Lieutenant General Count de Morcerf, peer of France?
092.119 --Oh! cried the general, struck by these words as if by a red-hot iron; oh, wretch, who reproaches me for my shame at the moment when you are perhaps going to kill me, no, I did not say that I was unknown to you; I know well, demon, that you have penetrated into the night of the past, and that you have read there, by the light of what torch, I did not know, every page of my life! But perhaps there is even more honor in me, in my opprobrium, than in you under your pompous exterior. No, no, I know you, I know it, but it is you that I do not know, adventurer sewn of gold and gems! You called yourself in Paris the Count of Monte Cristo; in Italy, Simbad the Sailor; in Malta, what do I know? But it is your real name that I ask of you, it is your real name that I want to know, in the midst of your hundred names, so that I may pronounce it on the battlefield at the moment when I thrust my sword into your heart."
092.120 The Count of Monte Cristo paled in a terrible way; his tawny eye blazed with a devouring fire; he leaped to the cabinet adjoining his room, and in less than a second, tearing off his cravat, frock coat and vest, he put on a little sailor's jacket and put on a sailor's hat, under which his long black hair unfolded.
092.121 He came back like that, frightening, implacable, walking with his arms crossed in front of the general, who had understood nothing of his disappearance, who was waiting for him, and who, feeling his teeth chattering and his legs giving way under him, took a step back and only stopped when he found on a table a point of support for his clenched hand.
092.122 "Fernand!" he cried, "of my hundred names I need only tell you one to strike you down; but that name you can guess, can't you? or rather you remember it? for, in spite of all my sorrows, all my tortures, I am showing you today a face that the happiness of vengeance rejuvenates, a face that you must have seen many times in your dreams since your marriage... to Mercedes, my fiancée!"
092.123 The general, with his head thrown back, his hands outstretched, his gaze fixed, devoured in silence this terrible spectacle; then, going to seek the wall as a point of support, he crept slowly through it to the door, by which he went out backwards, letting out this one mournful, lamentable, heart-rending cry:
092.124 "Edmond Dantes!"
092.125 Then, with sighs that had nothing human about them, he dragged himself to the peristyle of the house, crossed the courtyard like a drunken man, and fell into the arms of his valet, murmuring only in an unintelligible voice:
092.126 "To the hotel! To the hotel!"
092.127 On the way, the fresh air and the shame of his people's attention restored him to a state of collecting his thoughts; but the journey was short, and, as he drew nearer to his home, the Count felt all his pains renewed.
092.128 A few steps from the house, the Count stopped and descended. The door of the hotel was wide open; a carriage, quite surprised to be called to this magnificent residence, was parked in the middle of the courtyard; the Count looked at this carriage with fear, but without daring to question anyone, and rushed into his apartment.
092.129 Two people were coming down the stairs; he had only time to throw himself into a cabinet to avoid them.
092.130 It was Mercedes, leaning on the arm of her son, who was leaving the hotel.
092.131 They passed within two lines of the unfortunate man, who, hidden behind the damask door, was grazed, as it were, by the silk dress of Mercedes, and who felt on his face the tepid breath of those words pronounced by his son:
092.132 "Courage, my mother! Come, come, we are no longer at home here."
092.133 The words died away, the footsteps went away.
092.134 The general straightened up, hanging by his clenched hands on the damask curtain; he was compressing the most horrible sob that had ever come out of the chest of a father, abandoned by both his wife and his son...
092. 135 Soon he heard the iron door of the carriage slam, then the voice of the coachman, then the rolling of the heavy machine shook the windows; then he rushed into his bedroom to see once more all that he had loved in the world; But the carriage left without Mercédès' or Albert's head having appeared at the door, to give the lonely house, to give the father and the abandoned husband the last look, the farewell and the regret, that is to say the forgiveness.
092.136 Also, at the very moment when the wheels of the carriage shook the pavement of the vault, a shot rang out, and a dark smoke came out of one of the panes of that bedroom window, shattered by the force of the explosion.
093.000 Valentine.
093.001 One can guess where Morrel was dealing with and at whose house his appointment was.
093.002 So Morrel, leaving Monte Cristo, walked slowly towards Villefort's house.
093.003 We say slowly: Morrel had more than half an hour to walk five hundred steps; but, in spite of this more than sufficient time, he hastened to leave Monte Cristo, eager to be alone with his thoughts.
093.004 He knew well his hour, the hour at which Valentine, attending Noirtier's lunch, was sure not to be disturbed in this pious duty. Noirtier and Valentine had granted him two visits a week, and he came to enjoy his right.
093.005 He arrived, Valentine was waiting for him. Worried, almost lost, she took his hand and brought him before her grandfather.
093.006 This anxiety, pushed, as we say, almost to the point of bewilderment, came from the noise that the adventure of Morcerf had made in the world, one knew (the world always knows) the adventure of the Opera. At Villefort's, no one doubted that a duel was the forced consequence of this adventure; Valentine, with her woman's instinct, had guessed that Morrel would be Monte Cristo's witness, and with the well-known courage of the young man, with that deep friendship she knew him to have for the Count, she feared that he would not have the strength to confine himself to the passive role assigned to him.
093.007 It is understandable, therefore, how eagerly the details were requested, given, and received, and Morrel could read an inexpressible joy in the eyes of his beloved when she knew that this terrible affair had had an outcome no less happy than unexpected.
093.008 "Now," said Valentine, beckoning Morrel to sit down beside the old man, and sitting herself on the stool where his feet rested, "now let us talk a little of our business. You know, Maximilien, that good father had for a moment the idea of leaving the house and taking an apartment outside M. de Villefort's hotel?
093.009 -- Yes, certainly," said Maximilien, "I remember that plan, and I even applauded it.
093.010 --Well," said Valentine, "applaud again, Maximilien, for my father is coming back to it.
093.011 --Bravo! said Maximilien.
093.012 --And do you know," said Valentine, "what reason does bon papa give for leaving the house?"
093.013 Noirtier looked at his daughter to impose silence on her with his eye; but Valentine did not look at Noirtier; her eyes, her look, her smile, everything was for Morrel.
093.014 "Oh! whatever reason M. Noirtier gives," cried Morrel, "I declare that it is good.
093.015 --Excellent, said Valentine: he claims that the air of the Faubourg Saint-Honoré is worth nothing to me.
093.016 --In effect, said Morrel; listen, Valentine, M. Noirtier might well be right; for the last fortnight I find that your health is deteriorating.
093.017 --Yes, a little, it's true," replied Valentine; "so good dad has made himself my doctor, and as good dad knows everything, I have the greatest confidence in him.
093.018 --But it is true that you are suffering, Valentine?
093.019 --Oh, my God! that is not called suffering: I feel a general malaise, that is all; I have lost my appetite, and it seems to me that my stomach is struggling to get used to something."
093.020 Noirtier did not lose one of Valentine's words.
093.021 "And what is the treatment you are undergoing for this unknown disease?
093.022 --Oh, very simple," said Valentine; "every morning I swallow a spoonful of the potion they bring for my grandfather; when I say a spoonful, I started with one, and now I am up to four. My grandfather claims it's a cure-all."
093.023 Valentine smiled; but there was something sad and suffering in her smile.
093.024 Maximilian, drunk with love, looked at her in silence; she was quite beautiful, but her pallor had taken on a duller tone, her eyes shone with a more ardent fire than usual, and her hands, ordinarily mother-of-pearl white, seemed like hands of wax that a yellowish tinge invaded with time.
093.025 From Valentine, the young man turned his eyes to Noirtier; the latter regarded with that strange and profound intelligence the girl absorbed in her love; but he too, like Morrel, followed these traces of a dull suffering, so little visible moreover that it had escaped the eye of all, except that of the father and the lover.
093.026 "But," said Morrel, "this potion of which you have come up with four spoonfuls, I saw it medicated for M. Noirtier?
093.027 --I know it is very bitter," said Valentine, "so bitter that everything I drink after it seems to have the same taste."
093.028 Noirtier looked at his daughter questioningly.
093.029 "Yes, good papa," said Valentine, "it is like that. Just now, before going down to your house, I drank a glass of sweet water; well, I left half of it so bitter it seemed to me."
093.030 Noirtier paled, and made a sign that he wanted to speak.
093.031 Valentine got up to fetch the dictionary.
093.032 Noirtier followed her with his eyes with visible anguish.
093.033 Indeed, the blood was rushing to the girl's head, her cheeks were turning color.
093.034 "Well," she exclaimed, without losing any of her cheerfulness, "it's strange: a dazzle! Is it the sun that hit me in the eyes?
093.035 And she leaned against the espagnolette of the window.
093.036 "There is no sun," said Morrel, even more worried about the expression on Noirtier's face than about Valentine's indisposition.
093.037 And he ran to Valentine.
093.038 The girl smiled.
093.039 "Don't worry, good father," she said to Noirtier, "don't worry, Maximilien, it's nothing, and the thing has already passed: but listen, isn't that the sound of a carriage I hear in the courtyard?"
093.040 She opened Noirtier's door, ran to a window in the corridor, and returned hastily.
093.041 "Yes," she said, "it is Mme. Danglars and her daughter who are coming to pay us a visit. Good-bye, I'll run away, for they would come for me here; or rather, good-bye, stay close to good papa, Monsieur Maximilien, I promise you I won't keep them."
093.042 Morrel followed her with his eyes, saw her close the door, and heard her go up the little staircase which led both to Mme. de Villefort's and to her house.
093.043 As soon as she had disappeared, Noirtier signaled to Morrel to take the dictionary. Morrel obeyed; he had, guided by Valentine, quickly become accustomed to understanding the old man.
093.044 However, however accustomed he was, and since he had to go through some of the twenty-four letters of the alphabet, and find each word in the dictionary, it was not until ten minutes had passed that the old man's thought was translated into these words:
093.045 "Look for the glass of water and the carafe that are in Valentine's room."
093.046 Morrel immediately rang the servant who had replaced Barrois, and in Noirtier's name gave him this order.
093.047 The servant returned a moment later.
093.048 The decanter and the glass were completely empty.
093.049 Noirtier signaled that he wanted to speak.
093.050 "Why are the glass and carafe empty? Valentine said she only drank half the glass."
093.051 Translating this new request took another five minutes.
093.052 "I don't know," said the servant; "but the maid is in Miss Valentine's apartment: perhaps it was she who emptied them.
093.053 --Ask her," said Morrel, this time translating Noirtier's thought with his eyes.
093.054 The servant went out, and almost immediately returned.
093.055 "Mlle. Valentine passed through his room to get to Mme. de Villefort's," he said; "and, as she was thirsty, she drank what was left in the glass; as for the decanter, M. Édouard emptied it to make a pond for his ducks."
093.056 Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as a gambler does when he gambles on everything he possesses.
093.057 From then on, the old man's eyes were fixed on the door and never left that direction.
093.058 It was, in fact, Mme. Danglars and her daughter whom Valentine had seen; they had been led to Mme. de Villefort's room, who had said that she would receive guests at her house; that was why Valentine had passed through her apartment: her room was on the same level as that of her mother-in-law, and the two rooms were separated only by that of Edouard.
093.059 The two women entered the living room with that sort of official stiffness which presages a communication.
093.060 Between people of the same world, a nuance is soon grasped. Mme de Villefort responded to this solemnity with solemnity.
093.061 At this moment, Valentine entered, and the reverences began again.
093.062 "Dear friend," said the baroness, as the two young girls took each other's hands, "I came with Eugenie to announce to you first the very soon marriage of my daughter with Prince Cavalcanti."
093.063 Danglars had maintained the title of prince. The popular banker had found that it sounded better than count.
093.064 "Then allow me to offer you my sincere compliments," replied Mme. de Villefort. M. le prince Cavalcanti seems a young man full of rare qualities.
093.065 --Listen," said the baroness, smiling; "if we speak as two friends, I must tell you that the prince does not yet seem to us to be what he will be. He has in him a little of that strangeness which makes us Frenchmen recognize at first sight an Italian or German gentleman. However he announces a very good heart, much sharpness of spirit, and as for the conveniences, Mr. Danglars claims that fortune is majestic; it is his word.
093.066 --And then," said Eugenie, leafing through Mme. de Villefort's album, "add, madame, that you have a very particular inclination for this young man.
093.067 --And, said Mme de Villefort, I need not ask you if you share this inclination?
093.068 --Me!" replied Eugenie with her usual aplomb, "not in the least, madame; my vocation was not to be chained to the care of a household or to the whims of any man. My vocation was to be an artist and therefore free of my heart, my person and my thought."
093.069 Eugenie pronounced these words with an accent so vibrant and firm, that the red rose to Valentine's face. The fearful girl could not understand this vigorous nature which seemed to have none of the shyness of a woman.
093.070 "Besides," she continued, "since I am destined to be married, willingly or unwillingly, I must thank Providence, which has at least procured for me the disdain of M. Albert de Morcerf; without this Providence, I would be today the wife of a man lost to honor.
093.071 - "It is nevertheless true," said the baroness, with that strange naivety which one sometimes finds in great ladies, and which commoner company cannot make them lose completely, "it is nevertheless true, without this hesitation of the Morcerfs, my daughter would have married this M. Albert: the general was very keen on it, he had even come to force the hand of M. Danglars; we escaped it.
093.072 --But, said Valentine timidly, does all this shame of the father reflect on the son? Mr. Albert seems to me quite innocent of all these treacheries of the general.
093.073 --Pardon, dear friend, said the implacable young lady; M. Albert claims and deserves his share: it seems that after having provoked M. de Monte-Cristo yesterday at the Opera, he has today apologized to him on the field.
093.074 --Impossible!" said Mme de Villefort.
093.075 --Ah! dear friend, said Mme. Danglars with that same naivety which we have already pointed out, the thing is certain; I know it from M. Debray, who was present at the explanation."
093.076 Valentine also knew the truth, but she did not answer. Repulsed by a word in her memories, she found herself in thought in Noirtier's room, where Morrel was waiting for her.
093.077 Plunged into this sort of interior contemplation, Valentine had for a moment ceased to take part in the conversation; it would even have been impossible for her to repeat what had been said for some minutes, when suddenly the hand of Mme. Danglars, resting on her arm, drew her out of her reverie.
093.078 "What is it, madame?" said Valentine, flinching at the touch of Madame Danglars' fingers, as she would have flinched at an electric touch.
093.079 -- "It is, my dear Valentine," said the baroness, "that you are suffering, no doubt?
093.080 --Me?" said the young girl, passing her hand over her burning forehead.
093.081 -- Yes; look at yourself in this mirror; you have blushed and paled successively three or four times in the space of a minute.
093.082 -- Indeed," cried Eugenie, "you are very pale!
093.083 --Oh, don't worry, Eunice; I have been like this for a few days."
093.084 And however little cunning she was, the young girl understood that this was an opportunity to go out. Besides, Mme. de Villefort came to her aid.
093.085 "Withdraw, Valentine," she said; "you are really suffering, and these ladies will want to forgive you; drink a glass of pure water and it will make you well."
093.086 Valentine kissed Eugenie, greeted Mme. Danglars already up to retire, and went out.
093.087 "That poor child," said Mme. de Villefort when Valentine had disappeared, "she worries me seriously, and I should not be surprised when some serious accident happened to her."
093.088 However, Valentine, in a sort of exaltation of which she was not aware, had crossed Edward's room without answering I don't know what nastiness the child had done, and by her house had reached the little staircase. She had climbed all the steps minus the last three; she could already hear Morrel's voice, when suddenly a cloud passed before her eyes, her stiffened foot missed the step, her hands had no more strength to hold her to the banister, and crumpling the partition, she rolled off the top of the last three steps rather than going down them.
093.089 Morrel leaped up; he opened the door, and found Valentine lying on the landing.
093.090 Quick as a flash, he took her in his arms and sat her in an armchair. Valentine opened his eyes again.
093.091 "Oh, clumsy as I am," she said with a feverish volubility, "I don't know how to hold myself anymore. I forget that there are three steps before the landing!
093.092 --You are hurt perhaps, Valentine? Oh, my God! my God!
093.093 Valentine looked around: she saw the deepest fright painted in Noirtier's eyes.
093.094 "Don't worry, good father," she said, trying to smile; "it's nothing, it's nothing... my head has turned, that's all.
093.095 --Another dizziness!" said Morrel, joining his hands. Oh, be careful, Valentine, I beg you.
093.096 --But no, said Valentine, but no, I tell you that everything is over and that it was nothing. Now let me tell you some news: in eight days Eugenie is getting married, and in three days there is a sort of great feast, an engagement dinner. We are all invited, my father, Mme de Villefort and I, as I understand it.
093.097 --When will it be our turn to attend to these details? Oh, Valentine, you who can tell so much about our good father, make sure that he answers you: "Soon!
093.098 --And so, asked Valentine, you are counting on me to stimulate the slowness and awaken the memory of good papa?
093.099 --Yes," cried Morrel. My God! my God! be quick. As long as you are not mine, Valentine, it will always seem to me that you will escape me.
093.100 --Oh!" replied Valentine with a convulsive movement, "oh, in truth, Maximilien, you are too fearful, for an officer, for a soldier who, it is said, has never known fear. Ha! ha! ha!"
093.101 And she burst into a shrill, painful laugh; her arms stiffened and turned, her head fell back on her chair, and she remained motionless.
093.102 The cry of terror that God was chaining to Noirtier's lips burst from her eyes.
093.103 Morrel understood; it was a matter of calling for help.
093.104 The young man hung on the doorbell; the maid who was in Valentine's apartment and the servant who had replaced Barrois came running at once.
093.105 Valentine was so pale, so cold, so lifeless, that, without listening to what was said to them, the fear that was always present in this cursed house took hold of them, and they rushed through the corridors shouting for help.
093.106 Mrs. Danglars and Eugenie were coming out at this very moment; they were still able to learn the cause of all this rumor.
093.107 "I told you so!" cried Mme de Villefort. Poor little thing."
094.000 The confession.
094.001 At the same moment, M. de Villefort's voice was heard shouting from his study:
094.002 "What is it?"
094.003 Morrel looked at Noirtier, who had just regained his composure, and who at a glance indicated the cabinet where he had once before, in a similar circumstance, taken refuge.
094.004 He had only time to take his hat and to throw himself into it, panting. The footsteps of the king's prosecutor could be heard in the corridor.
094.005 Villefort rushed into the room, ran to Valentine and took her in his arms.
094.006 "A doctor! A doctor! M. d'Avrigny!" cried Villefort, "or rather I'll go myself.
094.007 And he rushed out of the apartment.
094.008 Morrel rushed through the other door.
094.009 He had just been struck to the heart by a dreadful memory: that conversation between Villefort and the doctor, which he had heard the night Mme. de Saint-Méran died, came back to his mind; these symptoms, brought to a less frightening degree, were the same ones that had preceded Barrois' death.
094.010 At the same time it seemed to him that he heard the voice of Monte Cristo rustling in his ear, which had said to him only two hours ago:
094.011 "Whatever you need, Morrel, come to me, I can do much."
094.012 Faster than thought, he thus dashed from the Faubourg Saint-Honoré into the Rue Matignon, and from the Rue Matignon into the Avenue des Champs-Élysées.
094.013 In the meantime, M. de Villefort arrived at M. d'Avrigny's door in a cabriolet; he rang the bell so violently that the concierge came to open the door with a frightened air. Villefort rushed up the stairs without having the strength to say anything. The concierge knew him and left him, only shouting:
094.014 "Into his chambers, M. le procureur du roi, into his chambers!"
094.015 Villefort was already pushing or rather breaking down the door.
094.016 "Ah!" said the doctor, "it's you!
094.017 --Yes," said Villefort, closing the door behind him; "yes, doctor, it is I who have come to ask you in my turn if we are alone. Doctor, my house is a cursed house!
094.018 --What!" said the latter coldly in appearance, but with a deep inner emotion, "do you still have a patient?
094.019 --Yes, doctor!" cried Villefort, seizing a handful of hair with a convulsive hand, "yes!
094.020 D'Avrigny's look meant, "I told you so."
094.021 Then his lips slowly accentuated these words:
094.022 "Who then is going to die in your house and what new victim is going to accuse us of weakness before God?"
094.023 A painful sob burst from Villefort's heart; he approached the doctor, and seizing his arm:
094.024 "Valentine!" he said, "it is Valentine's turn!
094.025 --Your daughter!" cried d'Avrigny, seized with pain and surprise.
094.026 --You see that you were mistaken, murmured the magistrate; come and see her, and on her bed of pain, ask her pardon for having suspected her.
094.027 -Every time you warned me, said M. d'Avrigny, it was too late: never mind, I'm going; but let's hurry, sir, with the enemies who are knocking at your door, there's no time to lose.
094.028 --Oh, this time, doctor, you will no longer reproach me for my weakness. This time I will know the murderer and I will strike.
094.029 -- "Let us try to save the victim before we think of avenging him," said d'Avrigny. Come."
094.030 And the cabriolet which had brought Villefort brought him back at a fast trot, accompanied by d'Avrigny, at the very moment when, on his side, Morrel knocked at Monte Cristo's door.
094.031 The Count was in his study, and, very worried, was reading a note that Bertuccio had just sent him in a hurry.
094.032 On hearing Morrel announced that he was leaving just two hours ago, the Count raised his head.
094.033 For him, as for the Count, many things had undoubtedly happened during those two hours, for the young man, who had left him with a smile on his lips, was returning with an upset face.
094.034 He got up and rushed to meet Morrel.
094.035 "What is it, Maximilian? He asked him; you are pale, and your forehead is dripping with sweat."
094.036 Morrel fell into an armchair rather than sat down.
094.037 "Yes," he said, "I came quickly, I needed to talk to you.
094.038 -Is everyone in your family well?" asked the Count with a tone of affectionate benevolence, the sincerity of which no one could have mistaken.
094.039 --Thank you, Count, thank you," said the young man, visibly embarrassed to begin the conversation; "yes, in my family everyone is well.
094.040 --That's fine; however, do you have something to tell me?" continued the Count, more and more worried.
094.041 --Yes," said Morrel, "it is true that I have just come out of a house where death had just entered, to come to you.
094.042 -Did you come out of M. de Morcerf's house? asked Monte Cristo.
094.043 --No, said Morrel; has anyone died at M. de Morcerf's?
094.044 --The general has just burned his brains out, replied Monte-Cristo.
094.045 --Oh! the awful misfortune! cried Maximilian.
094.046 --Not for the Countess, not for Albert, said Monte Cristo; better a dead father and husband than a dishonored father and husband; blood will wash away the shame.
094.047 --Poor Countess! said Maximilian, it is she whom I pity most of all, such a noble woman!
094.048 --Pity Albert too, Maximilian; for, believe it, he is the Countess's worthy son. But let us return to you: you came running to me, you said to me; would I have the happiness that you needed me?
094.049 -- Yes, I need you, that is to say, I believed like a fool that you could help me in a circumstance where God alone can help me.
094.050 --Say always," replied Monte Cristo.
094.051 --Oh!" said Morrel, "I do not know in truth whether I am permitted to reveal such a secret to human ears; but fate impels me to it, necessity compels me, Count."
094.052 Morrel stopped hesitantly.
094.053 "Do you believe that I love you?" said Monte Cristo, affectionately taking the young man's hand between his own.
094.054 --Oh! here, you encourage me, and then something tells me (Morrel laid his hand on his heart) that I must have no secrets from you.
094.055 -- You are right, Morrel, it is God who speaks to your heart, and it is your heart that speaks to you. Tell me again what your heart tells you.
094.056 --Count, will you allow me to send Baptistin to ask you about someone you know?
094.057 -- I have put myself at your disposal, so I will put my servants at your disposal.
094.058 -- I will not live until I am sure she is better.
094.059 -- Shall I call Baptistin?
094.060 --No, I'll talk to him myself."
094.061 Morrel went out, called Baptistin and said a few words to him softly. The valet went running out.
094.062 "Well, is it done?" asked Monte Cristo, seeing Morrel reappear.
094.063 --Yes, and I will be a little more quiet.
094.064 --You know I'm waiting, said Monte Cristo smiling.
094.065 -- Yes, and I'm talking. Listen, one evening I was in a garden; I was hidden by a clump of trees, no one suspected that I could be there. Two people passed by me; let me keep their names to myself for the time being, they were talking in a low voice, and yet I was so interested in hearing what they were saying that I did not lose a word of it.
094.066 --It looks gloomy, if I am to believe your pallor and your shiver, Morrel.
094.067 -- Oh yes, very gloomy, my friend! Someone had just died in the house of the master of the garden where I was; one of the two people whose conversation I was listening to was the master of this garden, and the other was the doctor. Now, the first confided to the second his fears and pains; for it was the second time in a month that death had fallen, swiftly and unexpectedly, on this house, which one would think had been designated by some exterminating angel to the wrath of God.
094.068 --Ah! ah!" said Monte Cristo, looking fixedly at the young man, and turning his chair by an imperceptible movement so as to place himself in the shadow, while the daylight struck Maximilian's face.
094.069 "Yes," continued the latter, "death had entered this house twice in one month.
094.070 -- And what did the doctor say?" asked Monte Cristo.
094.071 -- He answered... He answered that this death was not natural, and that it had to be attributed...
094.072 -- To what?
094.073 -- To poison!
094.074 --Really!" said Monte Cristo with that light cough which, in moments of supreme emotion, served to disguise either his redness, his pallor, or the very attention with which he listened; "really, Maximilian, you have heard such things?
094.075 --Yes, dear Count, I have heard them, and the doctor added that, if such an event were to be repeated, he would feel obliged to appeal to justice."
094.076 Monte Cristo listened, or seemed to listen, with the greatest calm.
094.077 "Well," said Maximilian, "death has struck a third time, and neither the master of the house nor the doctor has said anything; death will strike a fourth time, perhaps. Count, to what do you think the knowledge of this secret commits me?
094.078 -My dear friend, said Monte Cristo, you seem to me to be telling an adventure that each of us knows by heart. The house in which you heard that, I know it, or at least I know one like it; a house where there is a garden, a father, a doctor, a house where there have been three strange and unexpected deaths. Well, look at me, I who have not intercepted any confidences, and who nevertheless know all this as well as you do, do I have any scruples of conscience? No, that does not concern me. You say that an exterminating angel seems to point to this house for the wrath of the Lord; well, who says that your supposition is not a reality? Do not see things that those who have an interest in seeing them do not want to see. If it is justice and not the wrath of God that walks about this house, Maximilian, turn your head away and let the justice of God pass."
094.079 Morrel shivered. There was something at once mournful, solemn, and terrible in the Count's accent.
094.080 "Besides," he continued, with a change of voice so marked that it seemed as if these last words were not coming from the same man's mouth, "who is to say that it will happen again?
094.081 -- It is beginning again, Count!" cried Morrel, "and that is why I have come to you.
094.082 -- Well, what do you want me to do, Morrel? Would you like me, by any chance, to warn the king's attorney?"
094.083 Monte Cristo articulated these last words with such clarity and with such vibrant accentuation, that Morrel, suddenly rising, exclaimed:
094.084 "Count! Count! You know who I mean, don't you?
094.085 --Eh! perfectly, my good friend, and I will prove it to you by dotting the _i_, or rather the names on the men. You took a walk one evening in M. de Villefort's garden; from what you have told me, I presume it was the evening of Mme. de Saint-Méran's death. You heard M. de Villefort talking with M. d'Avrigny about the death of M. de Saint-Méran and the no less astonishing death of the marquise. M. d'Avrigny said that he believed in a poisoning and even in two poisonings; and here you are, you honest man par excellence, here you are since that moment busy feeling your heart, throwing the probe into your conscience to know if you must reveal this secret or keep it silent. We are no longer in the Middle Ages, dear friend, and there are no more Sainte-Vehme, there are no more frank judges; what on earth are you going to ask these people? Conscience, what do you want from me? as Sterne says. Eh, my dear, let them sleep if they sleep, let them grow pale in their insomnia, and, for God's sake, sleep, you who have no remorse that prevents you from sleeping."
094.086 A frightful pain painted itself on Morrel's features; he seized Monte Cristo's hand.
094.087 "But it's happening again! I tell you.
094.088 --Well," said the Count, astonished at this insistence which he did not understand, and looking at Maximilian attentively, "let it begin again: it is a family of Atrides; God has condemned them, and they will suffer the sentence; they will all disappear like those monks that children make with folded cards, and which fall one after the other under the breath of their creator, even if there were two hundred of them. It was M. de Saint-Méran three months ago, it was Mme. de Saint-Méran two months ago; it was Barrois the other day; today it is the old Noirtier or the young Valentine.
094.089 --You knew it?" cried Morrel in such a paroxysm of terror that Monte Cristo flinched, he whom the fall of heaven would have found impassive; "you knew it and you said nothing!
094.090 --What does it matter to me?" said Monte Cristo, shrugging his shoulders, "do I know these people, and must I lose the one to save the other? My goodness, no, for, between the guilty and the victim, I have no preference.
094.091 --But I, I! cried Morrel, screaming with pain, I love him!
094.092 --Who do you love?" exclaimed Monte Cristo, leaping to his feet and seizing the two hands that Morrel was raising, twisting them, toward the sky.
094.093 --I love madly, I love like a fool, I love like a man who would give all his blood to spare her a tear; I love Valentine de Villefort, who is being murdered at this moment, do you understand? I love her, and I ask God and you how I can save her!"
094.094 Monte Cristo uttered a wild cry of which only those who have heard the roar of the wounded lion can form an idea.
094.095 "Unhappy!" he cried, wringing his hands in turn, "unhappy! you love Valentine! you love this girl of a cursed race!"
094.096 Never had Morrel seen such an expression; never had such a terrible eye blazed before his face, never had the genius of terror, which he had seen so many times appear, either on the battlefields or in the homicidal nights of Algeria, shaken more sinister fires around him.
094.097 He recoiled in horror.
094.098 As for Monte Cristo, after this explosion and this noise, he closed his eyes for a moment, as if dazzled by interior flashes of lightning: during this moment, he recollected himself so powerfully, that one saw little by little the undulating movement of his chest swollen with storms subside, as one sees after the cloud melt under the sun the turbulent and frothy waves.
094.099 This silence, this recollection, this struggle, lasted twenty seconds or so.
094.100 Then the Count raised his pale forehead.
094.101 "See," he said in an altered voice, "see, dear friend, how God knows how to punish for their indifference the most boastful and coldest men before the terrible spectacles he gives them. I who was watching, impassive and curious assistant, I who was watching the development of this dismal tragedy, I who, like the evil angel, laughed at the evil that men do, sheltered behind secrecy (and secrecy is easy to keep for the rich and powerful), behold, in my turn I feel bitten by this serpent whose tortuous march I was watching, and bitten in the heart!"
094.102 Morrel gave a dull groan.
094.103 "Come, come," continued the Count, "enough complaints like this, be a man, be strong, be hopeful, for I am here, for I watch over you."
094.104 Morrel shook his head sadly.
094.105 "I tell you to hope! Do you understand me?" cried Monte Cristo. Know well that I never lie, that I am never mistaken. It is noon, Maximilian; give thanks to heaven that you have come at noon instead of coming tonight, instead of coming tomorrow morning. Listen to what I am going to tell you, Morrel: it is noon; if Valentine is not dead by now, she will not die.
094.106 --Oh, my God! my God!" cried Morrel, "I who left her dying!
094.107 Monte Cristo pressed a hand to his forehead.
094.108 What was going on in that head so heavy with frightening secrets?
094.109 What did the luminous angel or the angel of darkness say to this spirit, implacable and human at the same time?
094.110 Only God knows!
094.111 Monte Cristo raised his forehead once more, and this time he was as calm as a child awakening.
094.112 "Maximilian," he said, "return quietly to your home; I command you not to take a step, not to attempt a step, not to let the shadow of a concern float over your face; I will give you news; go.
094.113 -My God! my God!" said Morrel, "you frighten me, Count, with your coolness. Can you do anything against death? Are you more than a man? Are you an angel? Are you a God?"
094.114 And the young man, whom no danger had made retreat a step, recoiled before Monte Cristo, seized with an unspeakable terror.
094.115 But Monte Cristo looked at him with a smile at once so melancholy and so sweet, that Maximilian felt tears welling up in his eyes.
094.116 "I can do much, my friend," replied the Count. Go, I need to be alone."
094.117 Morrel, subjugated by this prodigious ascendancy which Monte Cristo exerted over all that surrounded him, did not even try to evade it. He shook hands with the Count and left.
094.118 Only, at the door, he stopped to wait for Baptistin, whom he had just seen appear at the corner of the Rue Matignon, and who was running back.
094.119 However, Villefort and d'Avrigny had made haste. When they returned, Valentine was still unconscious, and the doctor had examined the patient with the care that the circumstance demanded and with a depth that was doubled by the knowledge of the secret.
094.120 Villefort, suspended to his gaze and his lips, awaited the result of the examination. Noirtier, paler than the girl, more eager for a solution than Villefort himself, was waiting too, and everything in him was intelligence and sensitivity.
094.121 Finally, d'Avrigny let it out slowly:
094.122 "She still lives.
094.123 --Again!" cried Villefort, "Doctor, what a terrible word you have pronounced there!
094.124 -- Yes," said the doctor, "I repeat my sentence: she is still alive, and I am quite surprised.
094.125 -- But she is safe? asked the father.
094.126 --Yes, since she lives."
094.127 At this moment d'Avrigny's gaze met Noirtier's eye, it sparkled with such extraordinary joy of a thought so rich and fruitful, that the doctor was struck by it.
094.128 He let the young girl, whose lips were barely visible, so pale and white were they, fall back into the chair in unison with the rest of her face, and remained motionless, looking at Noirtier, by whom every movement of the doctor was expected and commented upon.
094.129 "Monsieur," said d'Avrigny then to Villefort, "call Miss Valentine's maid, if you please."
094.130 Villefort left his daughter's head, which he was supporting, and ran himself to call the maid.
094.131 As soon as Villefort had closed the door, d'Avrigny approached Noirtier.
094.132 "Do you have something to tell me?" he asked.
094.133 The old man blinked expressively; it was, it will be remembered, the only affirmative sign at his disposal.
094.134 "To me alone?
094.135 -- Yes," said Noirtier.
094.136 -Well, I'll stay with you."
094.137 At this moment Villefort returned, followed by the chambermaid; behind the chambermaid walked Mme de Villefort.
094.138 "But what has that dear child done?" she cried, "she has just come out of my house, and she did complain of being indisposed, but I had not thought it was serious."
094.139 And the young woman, with tears in her eyes, and with all the marks of affection of a true mother approached Valentine, whose hand she took.
094.140 D'Avrigny continued to look at Noirtier, he saw the old man's eyes dilate and round, his cheeks pale and tremble; sweat beaded on his forehead.
094.141 "Ah!" he said involuntarily, following the direction of Noirtier's gaze, that is, fixing his eyes on Mme. de Villefort, who was repeating:
094.142 "That poor child will be better in bed. Come, Fanny, we will put her to bed."
094.143 M. d'Avrigny, who saw in this proposal a means of remaining alone with Noirtier, nodded that it was indeed the best thing to do, but he forbade her to take anything in the world but what he would order.
094.144 Valentine, who had come to her senses, was carried away, but was unable to act or even speak, so broken were her limbs from the shock she had just experienced. However, she had the strength to greet her grandfather with a glance, whose soul seemed to be torn out of him as he was carried away.
094.145 D'Avrigny followed the patient, finished his prescriptions, ordered Villefort to take a cabriolet, to go in person to the chemist's to have the ordered potions prepared in front of him, to bring them back himself and to wait for him in his daughter's room.
094.146 Then, after renewing the injunction not to let Valentine take anything, he went back down to Noirtier's, carefully closed the doors, and after making sure that no one was listening:
094.147 "Let us see," he said, "do you know anything about this illness of your granddaughter's?
094.148 --Yes," said the old man.
094.149 --Listen, we have no time to lose, I will question you and you will answer me."
094.150 Noirtier signaled that he was ready to answer.
094.151 "Did you foresee the accident that happened today to Valentine?
094.152 --Yes."
094.153 D'Avrigny thought for a moment and then moved closer to Noirtier:
094.154 "Forgive me for what I am about to say," he added, "but no clue should be overlooked in the terrible situation in which we are. Did you see poor Barrois die?"
094.155 Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven.
094.156 "Do you know what he died of?" asked d'Avrigny, placing his hand on Noirtier's shoulder.
094.157 --Yes," replied the old man.
094.158 --Do you think his death was natural?"
094.159 Something like a smile came over Noirtier's inert lips.
094.160 "So the idea that Barrois had been poisoned came to you?
094.161 --Yes.
094.162 --Do you believe that this poison he fell victim to was intended for him?
094.163 --No.
094.164 --Now do you think that the same hand that struck Barrois, wanting to strike another, is striking Valentine today?
094.165 --Yes.
094.166 --So she will succumb too?" asked d'Avrigny, fixing his deep gaze on Noirtier.
094.167 And he waited for the effect of this sentence on the old man.
094.168 "No," he answered with an air of triumph that could have baffled all the conjectures of the most skillful diviner.
094.169 --So you hope?" said d'Avrigny with surprise.
094.170 --Yes.
094.171 -- What do you hope for?
094.172 The old man made it clear with his eyes that he could not answer.
094.173 "Ah, yes, it's true," murmured D'Avrigny.
094.174 Then returning to Noirtier:
094.175 "You hope," he said, "that the assassin will tire?
094.176 --No.
094.177 --Then you hope that the poison will have no effect on Valentine?
094.178 --Yes.
094.179 --Because I'm not teaching you anything, am I," added d'Avrigny, "by telling you that they've just tried to poison her?"
094.180 The old man made a sign with his eyes that he retained no doubt on this subject.
094.181 "Then how do you expect Valentine to escape?"
094.182 Noirtier stubbornly held his eyes fixed on the same side, d'Avrigny followed the direction of his eyes and saw that they were attached to a bottle containing the potion that was brought to him every morning.
094.183 "Ah! ah!" said d'Avrigny, struck by a sudden idea, "have you had the idea..."
094.184 Noirtier did not let him finish.
094.185 "Yes," he said.
094.186 --To protect her from the poison...
094.187 --Yes.
094.188 --By getting her used to it little by little...
094.189 --Yes, yes, yes," said Noirtier, delighted to be understood.
094.190 -- In fact, you heard me say that brucine was added to the potions I give you?
094.191 -- Yes.
094.192 --And by habituating him to this poison, you wanted to neutralize the effects of a poison?"
094.193 Same triumphant joy of Noirtier.
094.194 "And you succeeded indeed!" exclaimed d'Avrigny. Without this precaution, Valentine was killed today, killed without possible help, killed without mercy, the jolt was violent, but it was only shaken, and this time at least Valentine will not die."
094.195 A superhuman joy filled the old man's eyes, raised to heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude.
094.196 At that moment Villefort returned.
094.197 "Here, Doctor," he said, "here is what you asked for.
094.198 --This potion was prepared before you?
094.199 --Yes," replied the king's prosecutor.
094.200 --It did not leave your hands?
094.201 --No."
094.202 D'Avrigny took the bottle, poured a few drops of the beverage it contained into the palm of his hand and swallowed.
094.203 "Well," he said, "let's go up to Valentine's, I'll give my instructions to everyone there, and you yourself, Monsieur de Villefort, will see that no one deviates from them."
094.204 At the moment when d'Avrigny entered Valentine's room, accompanied by Villefort, an Italian priest, with a stern gait and calm, decided words, rented for his use the house adjoining the hotel inhabited by M. de Villefort.
094.205 It is not known by virtue of what transaction the three tenants of this house moved out two hours later: but the rumor that ran generally in the neighborhood was that the house was not solidly established on its foundations and was threatening to fall into ruin, which did not prevent the new tenant from taking up residence there with his modest furniture that very day, around five o'clock.
094.206 This lease was made for three, six or nine years by the new tenant, who, according to the habit established by the owners, paid six months in advance; this new tenant, who, as we have said, was Italian, was called signor Giacomo Busoni.
094.207 Workmen were immediately called in, and even at night the few passers-by lingering at the top of the suburb saw with surprise the carpenters and masons busy repairing the shaky house.
095.000 The father and the daughter.
095.001 We saw, in the previous chapter, Mme Danglars come to announce officially to Mme de Villefort the forthcoming marriage of Mlle Eugénie Danglars to M. Andrea Cavalcanti.
095.002 This official announcement, which indicated, or seemed to indicate, a resolution taken by all those interested in this great affair, had however been preceded by a scene of which we owe our readers an account.
095.003 We therefore ask them to take a step back and to go, on the morning of this day of great catastrophes, to this beautiful salon so well gilded that we have made known to them, and which was the pride of its owner, Baron Danglars.
095.004 In this salon, in fact, at about ten o'clock in the morning, the baron himself had been walking around for a few minutes, all pensive and visibly worried, looking at every door and stopping at every noise.
095.005 When his patience was exhausted, he called the valet.
095.006 "Etienne," he said to him, "see why Miss Eugenie has asked me to wait for her in the drawing-room, and inquire why she is making me wait there so long."
095.007 This puff of bad humor exhaled, the baron regained some calm.
095.008 Indeed, Miss Danglars, after her awakening, had sent for an audience with her father, and had designated the gilded salon as the place for this audience. The singularity of this step, its official character especially, had not surprised the banker, who had immediately complied with the desire of his daughter by going first to the lounge.
095.009 Stephen soon returned from his embassy.
095.010 "Mademoiselle's maid," he said, "announced to me that Mademoiselle was finishing her toilette and would not be long in coming."
095.011 Danglars nodded, indicating that he was satisfied. Danglars, towards the world and even towards his people, affected the good man and the weak father: it was a face of the role he had imposed upon himself in the popular comedy he was playing; it was a physiognomy he had adopted and which seemed to suit him as it suited the straight profiles of the masks of the fathers of the ancient theater to have the lip turned up and laughing, while the left side had the lip lowered and whining.
095.012 Let us hasten to say that, in the intimacy, the rolled up and laughing lip went down to the level of the lowered and crying lip; so that, for the majority of the time, the good man disappeared to make place to the brutal husband and the absolute father.
095.013 "Why on earth does this madwoman who wants to talk to me at what she pretends," murmured Danglars, "not simply come into my study; and why does she want to talk to me?"
095.014 He was rolling for the twentieth time this disquieting thought in his brain, when the door opened and Eugenie appeared, dressed in a black satin dress embroidered with matte flowers of the same color, coiffed in hair, and gloved as if she were going to sit in her chair at the Théâtre-Italien.
095.015 "Well, Eugenie, what's the matter?" cried the father, "and why the solemn salon, when we are so well in my private room?
095.016 -- "You are perfectly right, sir," replied Eugenie, motioning to her father that he might sit down, "and you have just asked two questions which sum up in advance the whole conversation we are going to have. I will therefore answer both of them, and against the laws of habit, the second one first as being the least complex. I have chosen the drawing room, sir, for my meeting place, in order to avoid the unpleasant impressions and influences of a banker's office. Those cash books, however well gilded, those drawers closed like fortress doors, those masses of bank bills that come from who knows where, and those quantities of letters that come from England, Holland, Spain, India, China, and Peru, generally act strangely on a father's mind, and make him forget that there is a greater and more sacred interest in the world than that of social position and the opinion of his constituents. I have therefore chosen this salon where you see, smiling and happy, in their magnificent frames, your portrait, mine, my mother's and all sorts of pastoral landscapes and tenderizing sheepfolds. I rely a lot on the power of external impressions. Perhaps, especially with regard to you, this is a mistake; but, what do you want? I would not be an artist if I did not have some illusions left.
095.017 --Very well, replied M. Danglars, who had listened to the tirade with imperturbable composure, but without understanding a word of it, absorbed as he was, like any man full of ulterior motives, in seeking the thread of his own idea in the ideas of the interlocutor.
095.018 --So there you have the second point cleared up, or thereabouts," said Eugenie without the slightest disturbance and with that all masculine aplomb which characterized her gesture and her speech, "and you seem to me to be satisfied with the explanation. Now let us return to the first. You asked me why I had requested this audience; I will tell you in two words; sir, here it is: I do not want to marry Count Andrea Cavalcanti."
095.019 Danglars leaped in his chair, and, from the jolt, raised both his eyes and his arms to heaven.
095.020 "My God, yes, sir," continued Eugenie, as calm as ever. You are astonished, I see, for since this whole affair has been in progress, I have not shown the slightest opposition, certain that I am always, when the time comes, to oppose frankly and absolutely to people who have not consulted me and to things which displease me. However, this time this tranquility, this passivity, as the philosophers say, came from another source; it came from the fact that, a submissive and devoted daughter... (a light smile drew itself on the empurpled lips of the young girl), I was trying to obey.
095.021 --Well?" asked Danglars.
095.022 -- Well, sir," continued Eugenie, "I have tried to the end of my strength, and now that the moment has arrived, in spite of all the efforts I have tried on myself, I feel unable to obey.
095.023 --But finally, said Danglars, who, as a secondary mind, seemed at first quite stunned by the weight of this pitiless logic, whose phlegm showed so much premeditation and strength of will, the reason for this refusal, Eugenie, the reason?
095.024 -The reason, replied the young girl, oh, my God, it is not that the man is uglier, or more foolish, or more disagreeable than another, no; M. Andrea Cavalcanti can even pass, if he wants to. Andrea Cavalcanti may even pass, near those who look at men by face and size, as being of a rather beautiful model; nor is it because my heart is less touched by this one than by any other: this would be a boarder's reason that I consider quite beneath me, I love absolutely no one, sir, you know that, don't you? So I don't see why, without absolute necessity, I should embarrass my life with an eternal companion. Didn't the wise man say somewhere: "Nothing too much"; and elsewhere: "Carry everything with you"? I was even taught these two aphorisms in Latin and Greek: one is, I believe, by Phaedrus, and the other by Bias. Well, my dear father, in the shipwreck of life, for life is an eternal shipwreck of our hopes, I throw into the sea my useless baggage, that is all, and I remain with my will, disposed to live perfectly alone and therefore perfectly free.
095.025 --Unhappy! Unhappy! murmured Danglars, turning pale, for he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he was encountering so suddenly.
095.026 - "Unhappy," continued Eugenie, "unhappy," you say, sir? But not, in truth, and the exclamation seems to me quite theatrical and affected. Happy, on the contrary, for I ask you, what do I lack? The world finds me beautiful, it is something to be welcomed. I like good welcomes: they make faces bloom, and those around me seem even less ugly. I am gifted with a certain spirit and a certain relative sensibility that allows me to draw from the general existence, to make it enter mine, what I find good there, as the monkey does when he breaks the green nut to draw out what it contains. I am rich, because you have one of the beautiful fortunes of France, because I am your only daughter, and you are not as tenacious as the fathers of the Porte-Saint-Martin and the Gaîté, who disinherit their daughters because they do not want to give them grandchildren. Besides, the far-sighted law has deprived you of the right to disinherit me, at least completely, just as it has deprived you of the power to force me to marry this or that gentleman. So, beautiful, witty, adorned with some talent as they say in the comic operas, and rich! but that is happiness, sir! Why do you call me unhappy?
095.027 Danglars, seeing his daughter smiling and proud to the point of insolence, could not repress a movement of brutality which was betrayed by a burst of voice, but it was the only one. Under the questioning glance of his daughter, in front of this beautiful black eyebrow, frowned by the interrogation, he turned over cautiously and calmed himself at once, tamed by the iron hand of circumspection.
095.028 "Indeed, my daughter," he answered with a smile, "you are everything you boast of being, except for one thing, my daughter; I don't want to tell you too abruptly what that is: I'd rather let you guess."
095.029 Eugenie looked at Danglars, greatly surprised that one of the jewels in the crown of pride she had just placed so superbly on her head was being challenged.
095.030 "My daughter," continued the banker, "you have explained to me perfectly what were the feelings which presided over the resolutions of a girl like you when she decided that she would not marry. Now it is for me to tell you what are the motives of a father like me when he has decided that his daughter shall marry."
095.031 Eugenie bowed, not as a submissive daughter who listens, but as an adversary ready to argue, waiting.
095.032 "My daughter," continued Danglars, "when a father asks his daughter to take a husband, he always has some reason for desiring her marriage. Some are afflicted with the mania that you said earlier, that is, to see themselves revived in their grandsons. I don't have this weakness, I'll start by telling you, the joys of the family are more or less indifferent to me. I can confess this to a daughter whom I know to be philosophical enough to understand this indifference and not to make a crime of it to me.
095.033 -- That's the spirit, said Eugenie; let's speak frankly, sir, I like that.
095.034 --Oh! said Danglars, you see that without sharing, as a general thesis, your sympathy for frankness, I submit to it, when I believe the circumstance invites me to do so. I will therefore continue. I proposed a husband to you, not for you, for in truth I was not thinking of you in the least at the moment. You like frankness, I hope; but because I needed you to take this husband as soon as possible, for certain commercial combinations that I am establishing at the moment.
095.035 Eugenie made a movement.
095.036 "It is as I have the honor of telling you, my daughter, and you must not blame me, for it is you who are forcing me to do so; it is in spite of myself, you understand it well, that I am entering into these arithmetical explanations, with an artist like you, who is afraid to enter a banker's office to perceive unpleasant and unpoetic impressions or sensations.
095.037 "But in this banker's cabinet, in which however you were kind enough to enter the day before yesterday to ask me for the thousand francs that I grant you each month for your fantasies, know, my dear lady, that one learns many things for the use even of young people who do not want to marry. One learns, for example, and for the sake of your nervous susceptibility I will teach you in this salon, one learns that a banker's credit is his physical and moral life, that credit sustains a man as breath animates the body, and M. de Monte-Cristo once made a speech on this subject that I have never forgotten. In it we learn that as credit withdraws the body becomes a corpse and that this must happen in a very short time to the banker who honors himself with being the father of such a good logicist daughter."
095.038 But Eugenie, instead of bending over, straightened up under the blow.
095.039 "Ruined!" she said.
095.040 --You have found the right expression, my daughter, the right expression," said Danglars, digging at his chest with his nails, while preserving on his rough face the smile of a man without heart, but not without spirit, "ruined!
095.041 --Ah!" said Eugenie.
095.042 -- Yes, ruined! Well, here it is known, this secret full of horror, as the tragic poet says.
095.043 "Now, my daughter, learn from me how this misfortune can, through you, become less; I will not say for me, but for you.
095.044 --Oh!" exclaimed Eugenie, "you are a bad physiognomist, sir, if you imagine that it is for my sake that I deplore the catastrophe you are exposing to me.
095.045 "Me ruined! And what does it matter to me? Do I not have my talent left? Can't I, like Pasta, like Malibran, like Grisi, do for myself what you would never have given me, no matter how rich you were, a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand pounds of income that I will owe to myself alone, and which, instead of coming to me as those poor twelve thousand francs that you gave me with reproachful looks and words of reproach about my prodigality, will come to me accompanied by acclamations, bravos and flowers? And when I don't have this talent, of which your smile proves to me that you doubt it, won't I still have this furious love of independence, which will always take the place of all treasures, and which dominates in me even the instinct of conservation?
095.046 "No, it is not for me that I am sad, I will always know how to get by; my books, my pencils, my piano, all things that are not expensive and that I will always be able to get, will always remain with me. You may think that I am grieving for Mrs. Danglars, but think again: either I am grossly mistaken, or my mother has taken all precautions against the catastrophe that threatens you and that will pass without reaching her; she has sheltered herself, I hope, and it is not by looking after me that she has been able to distract herself from her preoccupations with her fortune, for, thank God, she has left me all my independence under the pretext that I liked my freedom.
095.047 "Oh, no, sir, since my childhood I have seen too many things happen around me; I have understood them all too well, for misfortune to make more of an impression on me than it deserves to do; since I have known myself, I have been loved by no one; so much the worse! this has led me quite naturally to love no one; so much the better! Now you have my profession of faith.
095.048 -- "Then," said Danglars, pale with a wrath that did not take its source in offended paternal love; "then, mademoiselle, you persist in wishing to consume my ruin?
095.049 --Your ruin! I," said Eugenie, "to consume your ruin! What do you mean? I don't understand.
095.050 --Better, that leaves me a ray of hope; listen.
095.051 --I am listening, said Eugenie, looking so fixedly at her father that it took an effort for him not to lower his eyes under the powerful gaze of the young girl.
095.052 --Mr. Cavalcanti, continued Danglars, marries you and, in marrying you, brings you three millions of dowry which he places with me.
095.053 --Ah, very well," said Eugenie with sovereign contempt, while smoothing her gloves over each other.
095.054 -- Do you think I will make you wrong of these three millions? said Danglars; not at all, these three millions are destined to produce at least ten. I have obtained with a banker, my colleague, the concession of a railroad, the only industry which nowadays presents those fabulous chances of immediate success that Law once applied to the good Parisians, those eternal onlookers of speculation, to a fantastic Mississippi. By my calculation one must own a millionth of a rail as one once owned an acre of fallow land on the banks of the Ohio. It is a mortgage investment, which is progress, as you see, since one will have at least ten, fifteen, twenty, a hundred pounds of iron in exchange for one's money. Well, I have to deposit four million in my account within eight days! These four millions, I tell you, will produce ten or twelve.
095.055 --But during that visit I made to you the day before yesterday, sir, and which you will remember, continued Eugenie, I saw you cash in, that's the term, isn't it? five and a half millions; you even showed me the thing in two treasury bills, and you were surprised that a paper of such great value did not dazzle my eyes as would a flash of lightning.
095.056 -- Yes, but these five and a half millions are not mine and are only a proof of the confidence that people have in me; my title of popular banker has earned me the confidence of the hospitals, and the five and a half millions are in the hospitals; at any other time I would not hesitate to use them, but today people know the great losses that I have made, and, as I told you, credit is beginning to withdraw from me. From one moment to the next, the administration can claim the deposit, and if I have used it for something else, I am forced to make a shameful bankruptcy. I do not despise bankruptcies, believe me, but bankruptcies that enrich and not those that ruin. Whether you marry Mr. Cavalcanti, whether I receive the three million of the dowry, or even whether it is believed that I will receive it, my credit is strengthened, and my fortune, which for a month or two has been sinking into the abyss dug under my feet by an inconceivable fate, is restored. Do you understand me?
095.057 --Perfectly; you are pawning me for three million, aren't you?
095.058 --The higher the sum, the more flattering it is; it gives you an idea of your value.
095.059 --Thank you. One last word, sir: do you promise me to use the figure of this dowry that Mr. Cavalcanti is to bring as much as you like, but not to touch the sum? This is not a matter of selfishness, it is a matter of delicacy. I am willing to help rebuild your fortune, but I don't want to be your accomplice in the ruin of others.
095.060 --But since I tell you," cried Danglars, "that with these three millions...
095.061 --Do you think you'll get out of this, sir, without needing to touch those three million?
095.062 -- I hope so, but always on condition that the marriage, in being made, will consolidate my credit.
095.063 --Will you pay Mr. Cavalcanti the five hundred thousand francs you are giving me for my contract?
095.064 -- When he returns from the town hall, he will receive them.
095.065 --Good!
095.066 --How good? What do you mean?
095.067 -- I mean that by asking me for my signature, don't you leave me absolutely free of my person?
095.068 --Absolutely.
095.069 --Then, _good_; as I was saying, sir, I am ready to marry Mr. Cavalcanti.
095.070 --But what are your plans?
095.071 --Ah, that is my secret. Where would be my superiority over you if, having yours, I delivered mine to you!"
095.072 Danglars bit his lips.
095.073 "So," he said, "you are ready to make the few official visits that are absolutely indispensable.
095.074 --Yes," replied Eugenie.
095.075 --And to sign the contract in three days?
095.076 --Yes.
095.077 --Then, in my turn, it is I who say to you: Good!"
095.078 And Danglars took his daughter's hand and shook it between his own. But, extraordinarily, during this handshake, the father did not dare to say, "Thank you, my child"; the daughter did not smile for her father.
095.079 "Is the conference over?" asked Eugenie, rising to her feet.
095.080 Danglars nodded that he had nothing more to say.
095.081 Five minutes later the piano resounded under the fingers of Mlle. d'Armilly, and Mlle. Danglars sang Brabantio's curse on _Desdemona_.
095.082 At the end of the piece Etienne entered and announced to Eugenie that the horses were at the carriage and that the baroness was waiting for him to make her visits.
095.083 We saw the two women pass by Villefort's house, from where they left to continue their errands.
096.000 The contract.
096. 001 Three days after the scene we have just related, that is, about five o'clock in the afternoon of the day fixed for the signing of the contract of Mlle. Eugenie Danglars and Andrea Cavalcanti, which the banker had insisted on keeping prince, as a fresh breeze rustled all the leaves of the little garden in front of the Count of Monte Cristo's house, as the latter was preparing to go out, and while his horses were waiting for him by kicking, held by the hand of the coachman who had already been sitting on the seat for a quarter of an hour, the elegant phaeton with which we have already made several acquaintances, and in particular during the evening of Auteuil, came to turn the corner of the entrance door quickly, and threw rather than deposited M. Andrea Cavalcanti, as gilded, as radiant as if he, on his side, had been about to marry a princess.
096.002 He inquired about the Count's health with his usual familiarity, and, climbing slightly to the second floor, met him himself at the top of the stairs.
096.003 At the sight of the young man, the Count stopped. As for Andrea Cavalcanti, he was launched, and when he was launched, nothing stopped him.
096.004 "Hello, dear Monsieur de Monte Cristo," he said to the Count.
096.005 --Ah, Monsieur Andrea!" said the latter in his half-raucous voice, "how are you?
096.006 -- Wonderful, as you see. I've come to talk with you about a thousand things; but first, were you going out or coming in?
096.007 -- I was going out, sir.
096.008 --Then, in order not to delay you, I will get into your carriage, if you please, and Tom will follow us, driving my phaeton in tow.
096.009 --No," said the Count, who did not care to be seen in the young man's company, with an imperceptible smile of contempt; "no, I prefer to give you an audience here, dear Monsieur Andrea; one talks better in a room, and one has no coachman to catch your words on the fly."
096.010 The count therefore went into a small salon forming part of the second floor, sat down, and made, crossing his legs one on the other, a sign to the young man to sit down in his turn.
096.011 Andrea took his most laughing air.
096.012 "You know, dear count," he said, "that the ceremony takes place this evening; at nine o'clock the contract is signed at the father-in-law's.
096.013 --Ah, really? said Monte Cristo.
096.014 --How can this be news to you? And were you not warned of this solemnity by M. Danglars?
096.015 -It is so, said the count, I received a letter from him yesterday; but I do not believe that the hour was indicated there.
096.016 --That is possible; the father-in-law will have counted on public notoriety.
096.017 -- Well, said Monte-Cristo, you are happy, Monsieur Cavalcanti; it is a most fortunate alliance that you are contracting there; and then, Miss Danglars is pretty.
096.018 --But yes, replied Cavalcanti with an accent full of modesty.
096.019 --She is especially rich, at least I think so, said Monte Cristo.
096.020 --For rich, you think? repeated the young man.
096.021 --Surely; it is said that M. Danglars hides at least half his fortune.
096.022 --And he confesses fifteen or twenty millions, said Andrea with a glance sparkling with joy.
096.023 -- Not to mention, added Monte Cristo, that he is on the eve of entering into a kind of speculation already a little worn in the United States and in England, but quite new in France.
096.024 --Yes, yes, I know what you mean: the railroad which he has just won the tender for, isn't it?
096.025 -- Right! He will make at least, it is the general opinion, at least ten million in this business.
096.026 --Ten million! do you think? that's magnificent, said Cavalcanti, who was getting drunk on this metallic noise of golden words.
096.027 - "Not to mention," said Monte Cristo, "that all this fortune will be yours, and that it is only fair, since Miss Danglars is an only child. I am not sure that I have the right to do so, but I am sure that I have the right to do so, and I am sure that I have the right to do so, and I am sure that I have the right to do so. But let's leave money matters for a moment. Do you know, Mr. Andrea, that you have carried out this whole affair a little skillfully!
096.028 --But not bad, not bad, said the young man; I was born to be a diplomat.
096.029 -- Well, we'll get you into diplomacy; diplomacy, as you know, cannot be learned; it is a thing of instinct... The heart is thus taken?
096.030 --In truth, I am afraid so, answered Andrea with the tone with which he had seen Dorante or Valère answer Alceste at the Théâtre-Français.
096.031 --Do we like you a little?
096.032 --It is necessary, said Andrea with a victorious smile, since one marries me. But however, let us not forget a great point.
096.033 -What is it?
096.034 -It is that I have been singularly helped in all this.
096.035 --Bah!
096.036 --Certainly.
096.037 --By circumstances?
096.038 --No, by you.
096.039 --From me? Let it be, Prince," said Monte Cristo, pressing the title with affectation. What could I have done for you? Was your name, your social position and your merit not enough?
096.040 --No, said Andrea, no; and you may say so, sir count, but I maintain that the position of a man such as yourself has done more than my name, my social position and my merit.
096.041 -- "You are completely mistaken, sir," said Monte Cristo, who sensed the perfidious skill of the young man, and who understood the import of his words; "my protection was acquired for you only after you had become acquainted with the influence and the fortune of your father; for after all, who gave me, who had never seen you, or the illustrious author of your days, the happiness of knowing you? It was two of my good friends, Lord Wilmore and the Abbé Busoni. Who encouraged me, not to serve you as a guarantee, but to sponsor you? It is the name of your father, so well known and honored in Italy; personally, I do not know you."
096.042 This calm, this perfect ease made Andrea understand that he was for the moment embraced by a hand more muscular than his own, and that the embrace could not be easily broken.
096.043 "Ah, but," he said, "my father has really a great fortune, sir count?
096.044 --It seems so, sir," replied Monte Cristo.
096.045 -Do you know if the dowry he promised me has arrived?
096.046 -- I have received the letter of notification.
096.047 --But the three million?
096.048 --The three millions are on their way, in all probability.
096.049 --So I will really get it?
096.050 --But lady!" said the Count, "it seems to me that up to now, sir, money has not failed you!
096.051 Andrea was so surprised, that he could not help dreaming for a moment.
096.052 "Then," he said, coming out of his reverie, "it remains for me, sir, to address a request to you, and this one you will understand, even when it should be disagreeable to you.
096.053 --Speak, said Monte Cristo.
096.054 -- I have put myself in touch, thanks to my fortune, with many distinguished people, and I even have, for the moment at least, a host of friends. But in marrying as I am doing, in front of all Parisian society, I must be supported by an illustrious name, and in default of my father's hand, it is a powerful hand that must lead me to the altar; now, my father does not come to Paris, does he?
096.055 -- He is old, covered with wounds, and he suffers, he says, to death, every time he travels.
096.056 -- I understand. Well, I've come to make a request of you.
096.057 -- To me?
096.058 -- Yes, to you.
096.059 --And what is it? My God!
096.060 -- Well, it is to replace him.
096.061 --Ah, my dear sir! What! after the many relationships I have had the good fortune to have with you, you know me so badly as to make such a request of me?
096.062 "Ask me for half a million to borrow, and, although such a loan is quite rare, my word of honor! Know, then, that in his participation, especially moral, in the things of this world, the Count of Monte Cristo has never ceased to bring the scruples, I will say more, the superstitions of a man of the East.
096.063 "I, who have a seraglio in Cairo, one in Smyrna, and one in Constantinople, will never preside over a wedding!
096.064 --And so you refuse me?
096.065 --Net; and if you were my son, if you were my brother, I would refuse you in the same way.
096.066 --Ah! for example! cried Andrea disappointed, but how to make then?
096.067 -- You have a hundred friends, you said so yourself.
096.068 --All right, but it was you who introduced me to Mr. Danglars.
096.069 --Point! Let us re-establish the facts in all truth: it was I who made you dine with him at Auteuil, and it was you who introduced yourself; hell! that's quite different.
096.070 --Yes, but my marriage: you helped...
096.071 --Me! in no way, I beg you to believe it; but remember what I answered you when you came to ask me to make the request: "Oh, I never make marriages, me, my dear prince, it's a fixed principle with me.
096.072 Andrea bit her lips.
096.073 "But at last," he said, "you will be there at least?
096.074 --The whole of Paris will be there?
096.075 --Oh! certainly.
096.076 --Well, I'll be there as will all of Paris, said the Count.
096.077 --Will you sign the contract?
096.078 --Oh, I don't see any inconvenience in it, and my scruples don't go that far.
096.079 -- Finally, since you don't want to give me more, I must be satisfied with what you give me. But one last word, Count.
096.080 --What is it?
096.081 --A piece of advice.
096.082 --Beware; advice is worse than a favor.
096.083 --Oh, this one you can give me without compromising yourself.
096.084 --Say.
096.085 --My wife's dowry is five hundred thousand pounds.
096.086 --That is the figure that Mr. Danglars announced to me.
096.087 --Should I receive it or leave it in the hands of the notary?
096.088 -- This is generally how things are done when you want them done in a gallant manner: your two notaries make an appointment for the contract for the next day or the day after that; the next day or the day after that, they exchange the two dowries, for which they give each other a receipt, and then, when the marriage is celebrated, they put the millions at your disposal, as head of the community.
096.089 --It is that, says Andrea with a certain concern badly dissimulated, I believed to have heard to say to my father-in-law that he intended to place our funds in this famous business of railroad of which you spoke to me a moment ago.
096.090 --Well, but, resumed Monte Cristo, it is, as everyone assures us, a means of tripling your capital within the year. I am not sure that I have the right to do so.
096.091 -- Let us go then, says Andrea, all is well, without your refusal, however, which pierces my heart.
096.092 --Don't attribute it to anything but very natural scruples in such circumstances.
096.093 --Come on, says Andrea, let it be done as you wish; see you tonight, nine o'clock.
096.094 -- See you tonight."
096.095 And in spite of a slight resistance from Monte Cristo, whose lips paled, but who nevertheless retained his ceremonial smile, Andrea seized the Count's hand, shook it, jumped into his phaeton and disappeared.
096.096 The four or five hours which remained to him until nine o'clock, Andrea employed them in errands, in visits intended to interest these friends of whom he had spoken, to appear at the banker's with all the luxury of their crews, dazzling them by these promises of actions which, since, made all the heads turn, and of which Danglars, at this moment, had the initiative.
096.097 Indeed, at half past eight in the evening, Danglars' large salon, the gallery adjoining this salon, and the three other salons on the floor were full of a perfumed crowd that was attracted not so much by sympathy as by that irresistible need to be where one knows there is something new.
096.098 An academician would say that the evenings of the world are collections of flowers that attract inconstant butterflies, hungry bees and buzzing hornets.
096.099 It goes without saying that the salons were resplendent with candles, the light rolled down from the gold moldings onto the silk hangings, and all the bad taste of this furnishing, which had for its own sake only richness, shone through.
096.100 Miss Eugénie was dressed with the most elegant simplicity: a white silk dress brocaded with white, a white rose half lost in her jet-black hair, composed all her finery that did not come to enrich the smallest jewel.
096.101 Only one could read that in its eyes this perfect insurance intended to deny what this candid toilet had of vulgarity virginal in its own eyes.
096.102 Mrs. Danglars, thirty steps away from her, was talking with Debray, Beauchamp and Château-Renaud. Debray had come back to this house for this great solemnity, but like everyone else and without any special privilege.
096.103 M. Danglars, surrounded by deputies, men of finance, explained a theory of new contributions which he intended to put into effect when the force of things would have forced the government to call him to the ministry.
096.104 Andrea, holding under his arm one of the most dashing dandies of the Opera, explained to him rather impertinently, since he needed to be bold to appear at ease, his projects of life to come, and the progress of luxury which he intended to make with his hundred and seventy-five thousand livres of income to the Parisian fashion.
096.105 The general crowd rolled through these salons like an ebb and flow of turquoises, rubies, emeralds, opals and diamonds.
096.106 As everywhere, one noticed that it was the oldest women who were the most adorned, and the ugliest who showed themselves with the most obstinacy.
096.107 If there was some beautiful white lily, some sweet and fragrant rose, one had to look for it and discover it hidden in some corner by a mother with a turban, or by an aunt with a bird of paradise.
096.108 Every moment, in the midst of this crowd, this buzzing, this laughter, the voice of the ushers would call out a name known in finance, respected in the army, or illustrious in letters; then a faint movement of the groups would welcome this name.
096.109 But for one who had the privilege of making this ocean of human waves quiver, how many were greeted by indifference or the sneer of disdain!
096.110 At the moment when the hand of the massive clock, the clock representing Endymion asleep, marked nine o'clock on a golden dial, and when the bell, faithful reproducer of the mechanical thought, resounded nine times, the name of the Count of Monte Cristo resounded in its turn, and, as if impelled by the electric flame, the whole assembly turned toward the door.
096.111 The Count was dressed in black and with his usual simplicity; his white vest outlined his vast and noble chest; his black collar seemed of singular freshness, so much did it stand out against the paleness of his complexion; for all jewelry he wore a vest chain so fine that the thin thread of gold barely stood out against the white quilt.
096.112 Immediately a circle was formed around the door.
096.113 The Count, at a glance, saw Mrs. Danglars at one end of the room, Mr. Danglars at the other, and Miss Eugenie in front of him.
096.114 He first approached the baroness, who was talking with Mme. de Villefort, who had come alone, Valentine still being unwell; and without deviating, so much did the path clear before him, he passed from the baroness to Eugenie, whom he complimented in such rapid and reserved terms, that the proud artist was struck.
096.115 Near her was Mlle Louise d'Armilly, who thanked the count for the letters of recommendation he had so graciously given her for Italy, and of which she intended, she told him, to make incessant use.
096.116 Leaving these ladies, he turned around and found himself near Danglars, who had approached to give him his hand.
096.117 These three social duties accomplished, Monte Cristo stopped, walking around him that assured look imbued with that expression peculiar to people of a certain world and especially of a certain scope, a look that seems to say:
096.118 "I have done what I owed; now let others do what they owe me."
096.119 Andrea, who was in an adjoining salon, felt this sort of shudder that Monte Cristo had impressed upon the crowd, and he ran to greet the Count.
096.120 He found him completely surrounded; one disputed his words, as it always happens for people who speak little and who never say a word without value.
096.121 At this moment the notaries made their entrance and came to place their scribbled signs on the gold embroidered velvet that covered the table prepared for the signing, a table of gilded wood.
096.122 One of the notaries sat down, the other remained standing.
096.123 They were about to proceed to the reading of the contract that half of Paris, present at this solemnity, was to sign.
096.124 Everyone took their seats, or rather the women made a circle, while the men, more indifferent to the _style énergique_, as Boileau says, made their comments on Andrea's feverish agitation, on M. Danglars' attention, on Eugenie's impassivity, and on the light-hearted and playful way in which the baroness was handling this important business.
096.125 The contract was read in the midst of a profound silence. But, as soon as the reading was completed, the rumor began again in the salons, doubled from what it had been before: these brilliant sums, these millions rolling into the future of the two young people and which had come to complete the exhibition which had been made, in a room exclusively devoted to this object, of the bride's trousseau and the young woman's diamonds, had resounded with all their prestige in the jealous assembly.
096.126 The charms of Miss Danglars were doubled in the eyes of the young men, and for the moment they obliterated the glare of the sun.
096.127 As for the women, it goes without saying that, while envying these millions, they did not believe they needed them to be beautiful.
096.128 Andrea, squeezed by his friends, complimented, adulated, beginning to believe in the reality of the dream that he made, Andrea was on the point of losing the head.
096.129 The notary solemnly took the feather, raised it above his head and said:
096.130 "Gentlemen, we will sign the contract."
096.131 The baron was to sign first, then the proxy of Mr. Cavalcanti Sr., then the baroness, then the future spouses, as they say in that abominable style which is current on stamped paper.
096.132 The baron took the pen and signed, then the proxy.
096.133 The Baroness approached, on the arm of Mme de Villefort.
096.134 "My friend," she said, taking the pen, "isn't this a despairing thing? An unexpected incident, which has occurred in this affair of murder and robbery of which M. le Comte de Monte Cristo was almost the victim, deprives us of having M. de Villefort.
096.135 --Oh, my God!" said Danglars, in the same tone in which he would have said: "My goodness, I don't care!
096.136 --Mon Dieu! said Monte Cristo, approaching, I am afraid I am the involuntary cause of this absence.
096.137 -What, you, Count? said Madame Danglars, signing. If it is so, beware, I shall never forgive you."
096.138 Andrea pricked up her ears.
096.139 "It would not be my fault, however," said the Count; "so I want to see it."
096.140 One listened avidly: Monte-Cristo, who so rarely loosened his lips, was going to speak.
096.141 "Do you remember," said the Count in the midst of the deepest silence, "that it was in my house that this unfortunate man who had come to rob me died, and who, on leaving my house, was killed, so it is believed, by his accomplice?
096.142 --Yes, said Danglars.
096.143 --Well, in order to help him, he had been stripped and his clothes thrown into a corner where the law picked them up; but the law, in taking the suit and pants to deposit them at the clerk's office, had forgotten the vest."
096.144 Andrea paled visibly, and drew softly to the side of the door; he saw a cloud appearing on the horizon, and this cloud seemed to him to enclose the storm in its sides.
096.145 "Well, that unfortunate vest, they found it today all covered with blood and with a hole in the place of the heart."
096.146 The ladies gave a cry, and two or three prepared to faint.
096.147 "It was brought to me. No one could guess where the rag came from; I alone thought that it was probably the victim's vest. Suddenly my valet, searching with disgust and caution this funereal relic, felt a paper in the pocket and pulled it out: it was a letter addressed to whom? to you, baron.
096.148 --To me?" cried Danglars.
096.149 --Oh, my God! yes, to you; I succeeded in reading your name under the blood with which the bill was stained, replied Monte Cristo amidst the bursts of general surprise.
096.150 -But," asked Mme. Danglars, looking at her husband with concern, "how does that prevent M. de Villefort?
096.151 -It is quite simple, madame, replied Monte Cristo; this vest and this letter were what is called pieces of evidence; letter and vest, I sent everything to M. the King's prosecutor. You understand, my dear baron, the legal way is the surest in criminal matters: it was perhaps some machination against you."
096.152 Andrea stared at Monte Cristo and disappeared into the second salon.
096.153 "That's possible," said Danglars; "wasn't this murdered man a former convict?
096.154 --Yes, answered the Count, an ex-convict named Caderousse."
096.155 Danglars paled slightly; Andrea left the second salon and gained the anteroom.
096.156 "But sign, sign, sign!" said Monte Cristo; "I see that my story has put everyone in a state of excitement, and I humbly beg your pardon, Madame Baroness and Miss Danglars."
096.157 The baroness, who had just signed, handed the pen to the notary.
096.158 "Mr. Prince Cavalcanti," said the tabellion, "Mr. Prince Cavalcanti, where are you?
096.159 --Andrea! Andrea!" repeated several voices of young people who had already arrived with the noble Italian to that degree of intimacy of calling him by his baptismal name.
096.160 --Call the prince, warn him that it is for him to sign!" shouted Danglars to a bailiff.
096.161 But at the same moment the crowd of attendants poured back, terrified, into the main hall, as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments, _quaerens quem devoret_.
096.162 There was indeed reason to recoil, to be frightened, to scream.
096.163 An officer of the gendarmerie placed two gendarmes at the door of each salon, and advanced towards Danglars, preceded by a police commissioner wearing a scarf.
096.164 Mrs. Danglars gave a cry and fainted.
096.165 Danglars, who believed himself threatened (some consciences are never calm), Danglars offered to the eyes of his guests a face decomposed by terror.
096.166 "What is it, sir?" asked Monte Cristo, advancing to meet the commissary.
096.167 "Which of you gentlemen," asked the magistrate without answering the Count, "is named Andrea Cavalcanti?"
096.168 A cry of astonishment went out from every corner of the salon. One sought; one questioned.
096.169 "But who is this Andrea Cavalcanti?" asked Danglars, almost lost.
096.170 --An ex-convict escaped from the Toulon prison.
096.171 --And what crime has he committed?
096.172 --He is accused," said the commissioner in his impassive voice, "of having murdered the name Caderousse, his former companion in chains, as he was leaving the Count of Monte Cristo's house."
096.173 Monte Cristo cast a quick glance around him.
096.174 Andrea had disappeared.
097.000 The road to Belgium.
097.001 A few moments after the scene of confusion produced in the salons of M. Danglars by the unexpected appearance of the brigadier of gendarmerie, and by the revelation which had been the continuation, the vast hotel had emptied with a speed similar to that which would have brought the announcement of a case of plague or cholera-morbus arrived among the guests: In a few minutes by all the doors, by all the staircases, by all the exits, everyone had hastened to withdraw, or rather to flee; for this was one of those circumstances in which one should not even try to give those banal consolations which in great catastrophes make the best friends so unwelcome.
097.002 Only Danglars remained in the banker's hotel, locked up in his study and giving his statement to the police officer; Mme. Danglars, terrified, in the boudoir we know, and Eugénie who, with a haughty eye and a disdainful lip, had retired to her room with her inseparable companion, Mlle.
097.003 As for the numerous servants, even more numerous that evening than usual, for they had been joined by the ice-cream makers, the cooks and the maitre d' of the Café de Paris, turning their anger at what they called their affront against their masters, they were stationed in groups in the pantry, in the kitchens, in their rooms, caring very little for the service, which moreover was quite naturally interrupted.
097.004 In the midst of these different characters, quivering with diverse interests, only two deserve our attention: Miss Eugenie Danglars and Miss Louise d'Armilly.
097.005 The young fiancée, as we have said, had withdrawn with a haughty air, a disdainful lip, and with the gait of an outraged queen, followed by her companion, paler and more moved than she.
097.006 On reaching her room, Eugenie closed her door inwardly, while Louise fell into a chair.
097.007 "Oh, my God, my God! the horrible thing," said the young musician; "and who could have suspected this? Mr. Andrea Cavalcanti... a murderer... an escaped convict... a convict!"
097.008 An ironic smile tightened Eugenie's lips.
097.009 "In truth, I was predestined," she said. I escape from Morcerf only to fall into Cavalcanti!
097.010 --Oh, don't confuse the one with the other, Eugenie.
097.011 -Shut up, all men are vile, and I am happy to be able to do more than hate them; now I despise them.
097.012 --What are we going to do? asked Louise.
097.013 --What are we going to do?
097.014 -- Yes.
097.015 --But what we had to do in three days... leave.
097.016 --So, even though you're not getting married anymore, you still want to?
097.017 -- Listen, Louise, I abhor this orderly, compassive worldly life, regulated like our music paper. What I have always desired, aspired to, wanted is the life of an artist, the free, independent life, where one is responsible only to oneself, where one owes an account only to oneself. To stay, for what purpose? So that they can try, within a month, to marry me off again; to whom? to M. Debray, perhaps, as had been discussed for a moment. No, Louise; no, tonight's adventure will be an excuse for me: I wasn't looking for one, I wasn't asking for one; God has sent me this one, it is welcome.
097.018 --How strong and courageous you are! said the frail blonde girl to her dark companion.
097.019 --Did you not know me yet? Come, come, Louise, let us talk about all our affairs. The post car...
097.020 --Happily purchased three days ago.
097.021 -Did you have it driven where we were to take it?
097.022 --Yes.
097.023 --Our passport?
097.024 --Here it is!"
097.025 And Eugenie, with her usual aplomb, unfolded a paper and read:
097.026 "Mr. Leon d'Armilly, aged twenty, profession of artist, black hair, black eyes, traveling with his sister."
097.027 "Wonderful! By whom did you get this passport?
097.028 --When I went to ask M. de Monte-Cristo for letters for the directors of the theaters of Rome and Naples, I expressed to him my fears of traveling as a woman; he understood them perfectly, placed himself at my disposal to procure for me a man's passport; and, two days afterwards, I received this one, to which I added in my own handwriting: _Traveling with his sister._
097.029 -- Well," said Eugenie cheerfully, "it is only a question of packing our trunks: we shall leave on the evening of the signing of the contract, instead of the evening of the wedding: that is all.
097.030 --Think hard, Eugenie.
097.031 --Oh, all my thoughts are done; I am tired of hearing only about postponements, month ends, increases, decreases, Spanish funds, Haitian paper. Instead, Louise, do you understand the air, the freedom, the birdsong, the plains of Lombardy, the canals of Venice, the palaces of Rome, the beach of Naples. How much do we own, Louise?"
097.032 The girl being questioned drew from an inlaid secretary a small lockable wallet, which she opened, and in which she counted twenty-three bank bills.
097.033 "Twenty-three thousand francs," she said.
097.034 --And at least as many pearls, diamonds and jewelry, said Eugenie. We are rich. With forty-five thousand francs, we have enough to live like princesses for two years or properly for four.
097.035 "But before six months, you with your music, me with my voice, we will have doubled our capital. Come on, take charge of the money, I'll take charge of the jewel box; so that if one of us had the misfortune to lose her treasure, the other would still have hers. Now, the suitcase: let's hurry, the suitcase!
097.036 -Wait, said Louise, going to listen at Madame Danglars' door.
097.037 --What are you afraid of?
097.038 --That we might be surprised.
097.039 --The door is closed.
097.040 --When they tell us to open it.
097.041 --If you want to say so, we won't open.
097.042 --You are a real amazon, Eugenie."
097.043 And the two young girls began, with prodigious activity, to cram into a trunk all the travel items they thought they would need.
097.044 "There, now," said Eugenie, "while I go and change my costume, close the suitcase, you."
097.045 Louise pressed the lid of the trunk with all the strength of her little white hands.
097.046 "But I can't," she said, "I'm not strong enough; you close it.
097.047 --Ah, that's right," said Eugenie, laughing, "I forgot that I am Hercules, and that you are only the pale Omphale.
097.048 And the girl, leaning her knee on the trunk, stiffened her white and muscular arms until the two compartments of the suitcase were joined, and Mlle. d'Armilly had passed the hook of the padlock between the two pins.
097.049 When this operation was finished, Eugenie opened a chest of drawers, the key to which she had on her person, and drew from it a travel mantle of wadded purple silk.
097.050 "Here," she said, "you see that I have thought of everything; with this mantle you will not be cold.
097.051 --But you?
097.052 --Oh, I never get cold, you know that; besides, with these men's clothes...
097.053 --Are you going to get dressed here?
097.054 - No doubt.
097.055 --But will you have time?
097.056 -- Don't worry, you coward; all our people are busy with the big case. Besides, what is the wonder, when you think of the despair in which I must be, that I have locked myself up, say?
097.057 -- No, it's true, you reassure me.
097.058 -- Come, help me."
097.059 And from the same drawer from which she had brought out the mantle she had just given to Mlle. d'Armilly, and with which the latter had already covered her shoulders, she drew a complete man's suit, from the boots to the frock coat, with a supply of linen in which there was nothing superfluous, but in which was the necessary.
097.060 Then, with a promptitude that indicated that it was not undoubtedly the first time that she had put on the clothes of another sex, Eugenie put on her boots, put on a pair of pants, crumpled her tie, buttoned a high vest up to her neck, and put on a frock coat that drew her slim and arched waist.
097.061 "Oh, it's very good! In truth, it's very good," said Louise, looking at her with admiration; "but will this beautiful black hair, these magnificent braids that made all the women sigh with envy, hold up under a man's hat like the one I see there?
097.062 -You will see," said Eugenie.
097.063 And seizing with her left hand the thick braid on which her long fingers were only just closing, she seized with her right hand a pair of long scissors, and soon the steel screamed in the middle of the rich and splendid hair, which fell entirely at the feet of the young girl, turned back to isolate it from her frock coat.
097.064 Then, with the upper braid down, Eugenie moved on to the braids at her temples, which she pulled down successively, without the slightest hint of regret: on the contrary, her eyes shone, even more sparkling and joyful than usual, under her eyebrows as black as ebony.
097.065 "Oh, the beautiful hair!" said Louise regretfully.
097.066 --Am I not a hundred times better like this?" cried Eugenie, smoothing the scattered curls of her now masculine hair, "and don't you think I am more beautiful like this?
097.067 --Oh! you are beautiful, beautiful always! Now, where are we going?
097.068 --But to Brussels, if you like; that's the nearest border. We'll go to Brussels, Liege, Aachen; we'll go up the Rhine to Strasbourg, we'll cross Switzerland and we'll go down to Italy by the Saint-Gothard. Does that suit you?
097.069 -- Yes, it does.
097.070 -- What are you looking at?
097.071 -- I'm looking at you. In truth, you are adorable like this; it seems that you are taking me away.
097.072 -- Oh, my goodness, you would be right.
097.073 --Oh! I think you swore, Eugenie?"
097.074 And the two young girls, whom everyone might have believed to be plunged in tears, the one on her own account, the other out of devotion to her friend, burst out laughing, while making the most visible traces of the disorder that had naturally accompanied the preparations for their escape disappear.
097.075 Then, having blown out their lights, with questioning eyes, ears on the lookout, and necks stretched, the two fugitives opened the door of a toilet room which gave on to a service staircase descending to the courtyard, Eugenie walking first, and supporting with one arm the suitcase which, by the opposite handle, Mlle. d'Armilly was barely lifting with her two hands.
097.076 The court was empty. Midnight was sounding.
097.077 The concierge was still watching.
097.078 Eugenie approached softly and saw the worthy swiss who was sleeping at the back of his lodge, stretched out in his armchair.
097.079 She returned to Louise, took up the trunk she had placed on the floor for a moment, and the two of them, following the shadow cast by the wall, reached the vault.
097.080 Eugenie had Louise hidden in the corner of the door, so that the concierge, if he happened to wake up, would see only one person.
097.081 Then, offering herself to the full glare of the lamp that lit up the courtyard, she said
097.082 "The door!" she shouted in her most beautiful contralto voice, knocking on the window.
097.083 The concierge got up as Eugenie had foreseen, and even took a few steps to recognize the person who was coming out; but seeing a young man who was impatiently whipping his pants with his badine, he opened the door on the spot.
097.084 Immediately Louise slipped like a snake through the half-open door, and leaped out slightly. Eugenie, apparently calm, though in all probability her heart was beating more than in her usual state, went out in her turn.
097.085 A commissionaire passed by, he was charged with the trunk, then the two girls having indicated to him as the goal of their errand the Rue de la Victoire and number 36 of that street, they walked behind this man, whose presence reassured Louise; as for Eugenie, she was as strong as a Judith or a Dalila.
097.086 They arrived at the number indicated. Eugenie ordered the commissionaire to deposit the trunk, gave him a few coins, and, after knocking on the shutter, sent him away.
097.087 The shutter Eugenie had knocked on was that of a little linen maid who had been warned in advance: she had not yet gone to bed, so she opened it.
097.088 "Mademoiselle," said Eugénie, "have the concierge pull the carriage from the coach house, and send him for horses at the Post Office. Here are five francs for the trouble we are giving him.
097.089 --In truth, said Louise, I admire you, and I will almost say that I respect you."
097.090 The linen maid looked on in astonishment; but as it was agreed that there would be twenty louis for her, she made not the slightest observation.
097.091 A quarter of an hour later, the concierge returned bringing the postilion and the horses, which, in a turn of the hand, were hitched to the carriage, on which the concierge secured the trunk with a rope and a tourniquet.
097.092 "Here is the passport," said the postillion; "which road do we take, our young bourgeois?
097.093 --The road to Fontainebleau," replied Eugenie in an almost masculine voice.
097.094 --Well, what are you saying?
097.095 --I am giving the change, said Eugenie; this woman to whom we give twenty louis can betray us for forty: on the boulevard we will take another direction."
097.096 And the girl dashed into the briska established as an excellent sleeper, without almost touching the footboard.
097.097 "You are always right, Eugenie," said the singing mistress, taking her place beside her friend.
097.098 A quarter of an hour later, the postillion, back on the right track, crossed the gate of the barrier Saint-Martin, cracking his whip.
097.099 "Ah!" said Louise, breathing, "here we are, out of Paris!
097.100 --Yes, my dear, and the abduction is well and truly consummated, replied Eugenie.
097.101 -- Yes, but without violence, said Louise.
097.102 --I'll put that forward as an extenuating circumstance," replied Eugenie.
097.103 These words were lost in the noise that the car made as it rolled along the pavement of the Villette.
097.104 M. Danglars no longer had his daughter.
098.000 The Inn of the Bell and the Bottle.
098.001 And now, let us leave Miss Danglars and her friend to drive on the road to Brussels, and let us return to poor Andrea Cavalcanti, so badly stopped in the rise of his fortune.
098.002 It was, in spite of his still not very advanced age, a very skilful and intelligent boy that Mr. Andrea Cavalcanti.
098.003 Also, at the first rumors that penetrated the living room, we saw him by degrees approach the door, cross one or two rooms, and finally disappear.
098.004 A circumstance which we have forgotten to mention, and which however must not be omitted, is that in one of these two rooms through which Cavalcanti passed was exhibited the bride's trousseau, jewel cases of diamonds, shawls of cashmere, laces of Valenciennes, veils of England, all that composes finally that world of tempting objects whose name alone makes the heart of young girls leap with joy and which is called the basket.
098.005 Now, while passing by this room, what proves that Andrea was not only a very intelligent and very skilful boy, but also far-sighted, it is that he seizes the richest of all the exposed ornaments.
098.006 Provided with this viaticum, Andrea had felt half lighter to jump by the window and to slip between the hands of the gendarmes.
098.007 Tall and uncoupled like the ancient wrestler, muscular like a Spartan, Andrea had provided a race of a quarter of hour, without knowing where he went, and with the only goal to move away from the place where he had almost been taken.
098.008 Left of the street of the Mount Blanc, he had found himself, with this instinct of the barriers that the robbers possess, like the hare that of the lodging, at the end of the street Lafayette.
098.009 There, suffocated, panting, he stopped.
098.010 He was perfectly alone, and had on the left the clos Saint-Lazare, vast desert, and, on his right, Paris in all its depth.
098.011 "Am I lost?" he asked himself. No, if I can provide a greater amount of activity than my enemies. My salvation has thus become simply a matter of myriameters."
098.012 At this moment he saw, coming up from the top of the Faubourg Poissonnière, a regie cabriolet whose coachman, sullen and smoking his pipe, seemed to want to return to the extremities of the Faubourg Saint-Denis where, no doubt, he made his ordinary stay.
098.013 "Hey, friend!" said Benedetto.
098.014 --What is it, our burgher?" asked the coachman.
098.015 --Is your horse tired?
098.016 --Tired! ah! yes! he has done nothing all day long. Four bad errands and twenty cents tip, seven francs in all, I have to give the boss ten!
098.017 --Will you add to these seven francs twenty that are here, huh?
098.018 -- With pleasure, bourgeois; twenty francs is not to be despised. What is to be done about it?
098.019 --A very easy thing, if your horse is not tired, however.
098.020 -- I tell you that he will go like a zephyr; the only thing is to say which way he must go.
098.021 --The Louvres side.
098.022 --Ah! ah! known: country of ratafia?
098.023 -- Just so. It is simply a question of catching up with a friend of mine with whom I must hunt tomorrow at La Chapelle-en-Serval. He was to wait for me here with his cabriolet until half past eleven: it is midnight; he will have grown tired of waiting for me and will have left alone.
098.024 --That is probable.
098.025 -- Well, do you want to try to catch him?
098.026 -- I'd like nothing better.
098.027 --But if we don't catch him by Le Bourget you'll get twenty francs; if we don't catch him by Louvres, thirty.
098.028 --And if we catch him?
098.029 -- Forty! said Andrea who had had a moment's hesitation, but who had thought that he was not risking anything by promising.
098.030 -- All right! said the coachman. Get in, and let's go. Prrroum!..."
098.031 Andrea climbed into the cabriolet which, with a rapid race, crossed the Faubourg Saint-Denis, skirted the Faubourg Saint-Martin, crossed the barrier, and drove through the interminable Villette.
098.032 One did not take care to join this chimerical friend; however from time to time, with the lingering passers-by or the cabarets which still remained vigilant, Cavalcanti inquired about a green cabriolet harnessed to a bay-brown horse; and, as on the road of the Netherlands there circulates a good number of cabriolets, that the nine tenths of the cabriolets are green, the information rained with each step.
098.033 One always came to see it passing; it did not have more than five hundred, two hundred, of hundred steps of advance; finally, one passed it, it was not him.
098.034 Once the cabriolet was overtaken in its turn; it was by a carriage quickly carried away at the gallop of two post horses.
098.035 "Ah!" said Cavalcanti to himself, "if I had that carriage, those two good horses, and especially the passport that it took to take them!"
098.036 And he sighed deeply.
098.037 This carriage was the one that carried Miss Danglars and Miss d'Armilly.
098.038 "Let's go! Let's go!" said Andrea, "we can't wait to join him.
098.039 And the poor horse resumed the furious trot which it had followed since the barrier, and arrived all smoky at Louvres.
098.040 "Decidedly," said Andrea, "I see that I will not join my friend and that I will kill your horse. So I'd better stop. Here's your thirty francs, I'm going to sleep at the Red Horse, and the first carriage in which I find a place, I'll take it. Good evening, my friend."
098.041 And Andrea, after putting six five-franc pieces in the coachman's hand, jumped lightly onto the pavement of the road.
098.042 The coachman pocketed joyfully the sum and resumed the way of Paris; Andrea pretended to gain the hotel of the Red Horse; but after having stopped one moment against the door, hearing the noise of the cabriolet which was going to be lost with the horizon, it resumed its race, and of a gymnastic step strong raised, it provided a race of two leagues.
098.043 There he rested; he must have been very close to the Chapelle-en-Serval, where he had said he was going.
098.044 It was not fatigue that stopped Andrea Cavalcanti: it was the need to make a resolution, it was the need to adopt a plan.
098.045 To go up in diligence, it was impossible; to take the post office, it was also impossible. To travel in either way a passport is of all necessity.
098.046 To remain in the department of Oise, that is to say in one of the departments most discovered and most watched of France, it was still impossible thing, impossible especially for a man expert like Andrea in criminal matter.
098.047 Andrea sat down on the sides of the ditch, let his head fall between his two hands and thought.
098.048 Ten minutes later he raised his head; his resolution was fixed.
098.049 He covered with dust one side of the coat he had had time to unhook in the anteroom and button over his ball gown, and, gaining La Chapelle-en-Serval, he went boldly to knock at the door of the only inn in the country.
098.050 The host came to open.
098.051 "My friend," said Andrea, "I was going from Mortefontaine to Senlis when my horse, which is a difficult animal, swerved and sent me ten paces away. I must arrive tonight at Compiègne under pain of causing my family the most serious anxiety; have you a horse to hire?"
098.052 Good or bad, an innkeeper always has a horse.
098.053 The innkeeper of La Chapelle-en-Serval called the stable boy, ordered him to saddle _le Blanc_, and awakened his son, a child of seven, who was to ride the gentleman's hindquarters and bring back the quadruped.
098.054 Andrea gave the innkeeper twenty francs, and, drawing them from his pocket, dropped a calling card.
098.055 This calling card was that of one of his friends at the Café de Paris; so that the innkeeper, when Andrea had gone and picked up the card that had fallen from his pocket, was convinced that he had rented his horse to M. le Comte de Mauléon, rue Saint-Dominique, 25: it was the name and address that were on the card.
098.056 _Le Blanc_ did not go fast, but he went with an even and assiduous step: in three and a half hours Andrea covered the nine leagues that separated him from Compiègne; four o'clock was striking the clock of the town hall when he arrived at the square where the stagecoaches stop.
098.057 There is an excellent hotel in Compiègne, which is remembered by those who have only stayed there once.
098. 058 Andréa, who had made a halt there in one of his races in the surroundings of Paris, remembered the hotel of the Bell and the Bottle: He took his bearings, saw in the light of a street lamp the signpost, and, having dismissed the child, to whom he gave all the small change he had on him, he went to knock at the door, thinking very correctly that he had three or four hours before him, and that the best thing was to guard himself, by a good nap and a good supper, against the fatigues to come.
098.059 It was a boy who came to open the door.
098.060 "My friend," said Andrea, "I have just come from Saint-Jean-au-Bois, where I had dinner; I intended to take the carriage which passes at midnight; but I got lost like a fool, and here I am four hours walking in the forest. So give me one of those pretty little rooms overlooking the courtyard, and send me up a cold chicken and a bottle of Bordeaux wine."
098.061 The boy had no suspicion: Andrea spoke with the most perfect tranquility, he had a cigar in his mouth and his hands in the pockets of his paletot; his clothes were elegant, his beard fresh, his boots unblemished; he had the air of a retarded neighbor, that's all.
098.062 While the boy prepared his room, the hostess rose: Andrea greeted him with her most charming smile, and asked him if he could not have number 3, which he had already had at his last passage to Compiègne; unfortunately number 3 was taken by a young man who was traveling with his sister.
098.063 Andrea appeared desperate; he consoled himself only when the hostess had assured him that number 7, which one prepared for him, had absolutely the same arrangement as number 3; and, while warming his feet and while discussing the last races of Chantilly, he waited that one came to announce to him that his room was ready.
098.064 It was not without reason that Andrea had spoken of these pretty apartments overlooking the courtyard; the courtyard of the Hotel de la Cloche, with its triple row of galleries which gave it the air of a theatre, with its jasmines and clematis climbing up its colonnades, light as a natural decoration, is one of the most charming entrances to an inn that exist in the world.
098.065 The chicken was fresh, the wine was old, the fire clear and sparkling: Andrea surprised himself by supping with as good an appetite as if nothing had happened to him.
098.066 Then he went to bed, and almost immediately fell asleep with that relentless sleep which a man always finds at twenty, even when he has remorse.
098.067 Now we are forced to admit that Andrea could have had remorse, but he did not.
098.068 Here is what Andrea's plan was, a plan which had given him the best part of his security.
098. 069 With the day he rose, left the hotel after having rigorously paid his accounts; gained the forest, bought, under the pretext of making painting studies, the hospitality of a peasant; procured a lumberjack's costume and a hatchet, stripped the envelope of the lion to take that of the workman; Then, his hands earthy, his hair burnished by a leaden comb, his complexion tanned by a preparation of which his former comrades had given him the recipe, he gained, from forest to forest, the nearest frontier, walking at night, sleeping during the day in the forests or in the quarries, and approaching the inhabited places only to buy from time to time a loaf.
098.070 Once he had crossed the border, Andrea made money out of his diamonds, combined the price he got for them with a dozen bank bills that he always carried with him in case of an accident, and he still found himself in possession of about fifty thousand pounds, which did not seem to his philosophy to be too rigorous a stopgap.
098.071 Besides, he counted a lot on the interest that the Danglars had in extinguishing the noise of their misadventure.
098.072 That is why, in addition to the tiredness, Andrea slept so quickly and so well.
098.073 Moreover, to be awakened more morning, Andrea had not closed his shutters and had only been satisfied to push the bolts of his door and to hold all open, on his bedside table, certain very sharp knife whose excellent hardness he knew and which never left him.
098.074 At about seven o'clock in the morning, Andrea was awakened by a ray of sunlight that came, warm and bright, to play on his face.
098.075 In any well organized brain, the dominant idea and there is always one, the dominant idea, we say, is the one that, after having fallen asleep the last one still illuminates the first one the awakening of the thought.
098.076 Andrea had not entirely opened the eyes that the dominant thought held him already and breathed to him to the ear that he had slept too long.
098.077 He jumped down from his bed and ran to his window.
098.078 A policeman was crossing the courtyard.
098.079 The gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world, even to the eye of an unconcerned man: but to a timid conscience that has some reason to be so, the yellow, blue, and white of which his uniform is composed take on frightening hues.
098.080 "Why a gendarme?" asked Andrea.
098.081 Suddenly he answered himself, with that logic that the reader must have already noticed in him:
098.082 "A gendarme is nothing to be surprised about in a hostelry; but let's get dressed."
098.083 And the young man dressed with a rapidity that his valet had not been able to make him lose during the few months of the fashionable life he had led in Paris.
098.084 "Well," said Andrea as he dressed, "I'll wait until he's gone, and when he's gone I'll slip away."
098.085 And while saying these words, Andrea, rebooted and recravaté, gained slowly his window and raised a second time the curtain of muslin.
098.086 Not only had the first gendarme not left, but the young man saw a second blue, yellow and white uniform at the bottom of the staircase, the only one by which he could go down, while a third, on horseback and with a musket in his fist, stood sentry at the large door of the street, the only one by which he could leave.
098.087 This third gendarme was significant in the last respect, for in front of him stretched a semicircle of onlookers who tightly blocked the door of the hotel.
098.088 "One seeks me! was the first thought of Andrea. Devil!"
098.089 The pallor invaded the forehead of the young man; he looked around anxiously.
098.090 His room, like all the rooms on this floor, had no exit except the outside gallery, open to all eyes.
098.091 "I am lost!" was his second thought.
098.092 Indeed, for a man in Andrea's situation, arrest meant: trial, death, death without mercy and without delay.
098.093 One moment he compressed his head convulsively between his two hands.
098.094 In that instant he almost went mad with fear.
098.095 But soon, from this world of thoughts colliding in his head, a thought of hope sprang up; a pale smile appeared on his pale lips and on his contracted cheeks.
098.096 He looked around him; the objects he was looking for were gathered on the marble of a secretary: they were a quill, ink and paper.
098.097 He dipped the quill in the ink and wrote with a hand that he commanded to be firm the following lines on the first sheet of the notebook:
098.098 "I have no money to pay, but I am not a dishonest man; I leave as collateral this pin which is worth ten times the expense I have incurred. I will be forgiven for having escaped at daybreak; I was ashamed!"
098.099 He drew his pin from his tie and placed it on the paper.
098. 100 This done, instead of leaving his locks pushed, he pulled them, even ajar his door, as if he had gone out of his room forgetting to close it again, and slipping into the chimney as a man accustomed to these sorts of gymnastics, he drew to himself the paper front representing Achilles at Deidamie's, erased with his very feet the trace of his steps in the ashes, and began to climb the cambered pipe which offered him the only way of salvation in which he still hoped.
098.101 At this very moment the first gendarme who had struck Andrea's sight was ascending the stairs, preceded by the police commissioner, and supported by the second gendarme who was guarding the bottom of the stairs, who could himself wait for reinforcement from the one stationed at the door.
098.102 Here is to what circumstance Andrea owed this visit, which with so much sorrow he was prepared to receive.
098.103 With the point of the day, the telegraphs had played in all the directions, and each locality, warned almost immediately, had awaked the authorities and launched the force public to the research of the murderer of Caderousse.
098.104 Compiègne, a royal residence; Compiègne, a hunting town; Compiègne, a garrison town, is abundantly provided with authorities, gendarmes, and police commissioners; the visits had therefore begun as soon as the telegraphic order arrived, and the Hotel de la Cloche et de la Bouteille, being the first hotel in the city, had naturally been the first to be visited.
098.105 Moreover, according to the report of the sentries who had during that night been on guard at the city hall (the city hall is adjacent to the Inn of the Bell), according to the report of the sentries, we say, it had been noted that several travelers had gone down during the night to the hotel.
098.106 The sentry who had been relieved at six o'clock in the morning even remembered, at the time when he had just been placed, that is, at four o'clock and a few minutes, seeing a young man mounted on a white horse with a small peasant in his hindquarters, who had gone down to the square, dismissed peasant and horse, and had gone to knock at the Hotel de la Cloche, which had opened in front of him and had closed on him.
098.107 It was on this young man, so singularly retarded, that suspicions had fallen.
098.108 Now, this young man was none other than Andrea.
098.109 It was strong of these data, that the police commissioner and the gendarme, who was a brigadier, moved towards Andrea's door; this door was ajar.
098.110 "Oh! oh! says the brigadier, old fox nourished in the tricks of the state, bad clue that an opened door! I would prefer it locked with triple lock!"
098.111 Indeed, the little letter and pin left by Andrea on the table confirmed, or rather supported, the sad truth. Andrea had run away.
098.112 We say supported, because the brigadier was not a man to surrender on a single proof.
098.113 He looked around, dipped his eye under the bed, split the curtains, opened the cupboards, and finally stopped at the fireplace.
098.114 Thanks to Andrea's precautions, no trace of his passage had remained in the ashes.
098.115 However it was an exit, and in the circumstances in which one was, any exit had to be the object of a serious investigation.
098.116 So the brigadier had a bundle and straw brought to him, stuffed the chimney as he would have done with a mortar, and set it on fire.
098.117 The fire cracked the brick walls; an opaque column of smoke shot up through the flues and rose to the sky like the dark jet of a volcano, but he did not see the prisoner fall, as he had expected.
098.118 It was that Andrea, from his youth in struggle with society, was well worth a gendarme, this gendarme even if he was raised to the respectable rank of brigadier; foreseeing the fire, he had gone to the roof and stood huddled against the pipe.
098.119 For a moment he had some hope of being saved, for he heard the brigadier calling the two gendarmes and shouting aloud to them:
098.120 "He's not there anymore."
098.121 But as he gently stretched out his neck, he saw that the two gendarmes, instead of withdrawing, as the natural thing, on a first announcement, he saw, we say, that on the contrary the two gendarmes redoubled their attention.
098.122 In his turn he looked around: the city hall, colossal building of the sixteenth century, rose like a dark rampart, on his right, and by the openings of the monument, one could plunge in all the corners and recesses of the roof, as from the top of a mountain one plunges in the valley.
098.123 Andrea understood that he was going to see incessantly to appear the head of the brigadier of gendarmerie to one of these openings.
098.124 Discovered, he was lost; a hunt on the roofs presented him no chance of success.
098.125 He therefore resolved to go back down, not by the same route as he had come, but by a similar route.
098.126 He looked for the chimney from which he could see no smoke coming, reached it by crawling on the roof, and disappeared through its opening without being seen by anyone.
098.127 At the same moment, a small window in the town hall opened and the head of the gendarmerie brigadier passed through.
098.128 For a moment this head remained motionless like one of those stone reliefs that decorate the building; then with a long sigh of disappointment the head disappeared.
098.129 The brigadier, calm and dignified like the law of which he was the representative, passed without answering the thousand questions of the crowd gathered in the square, and returned to the hotel.
098.130 "Well?" asked the two gendarmes in turn.
098.131 -- "Well, my sons," replied the brigadier, "the brigand must have really distanced himself from us this morning at the right hour; but we are going to send out on the road to Villers-Cotterêts and Noyon and search the forest, where we will undoubtedly catch him."
098.132 The honorable official had scarcely, with the intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie, given life to this sonorous adverb, when a long cry of fright, accompanied by the redoubled ringing of a bell, resounded in the court of the hotel.
098.133 "Oh, oh, what's that?" cried the brigadier.
098.134 -- "Here is a traveler who seems to be in a great hurry," said the host. What number are they ringing?
098.135 -- Number 3.
098.136 -Go ahead, boy!"
098.137 At this moment the shouts and the sound of the bell redoubled.
098.138 The boy took off running.
098.139 "Not so," said the brigadier, stopping the servant; "the one ringing seems to me to be asking for something other than the boy, and we are going to serve him a gendarme. Who is staying at number 3?
098.140 --The little young man who arrived with his sister last night in a post-chair, and who asked for a room with two beds."
098.141 The bell rang a third time with an intonation full of anguish.
098.142 "To me!" shouted the brigadier, "follow me and follow the step.
098.143 - "Just a moment," said the host, "in room number 3 there are two stairways: one outside, one inside.
098.144 -Good! said the brigadier, I'll take the inside, that's my department. Are the rifles loaded?
098.145 -- Yes, Sergeant.
098.146 --Well, watch the outside, you people, and if he wants to run away, shoot him; he's a great criminal, so the telegraph says."
098.147 The brigadier, followed by the commissioner, disappeared at once down the inner staircase, accompanied by the rumor that his revelations about Andrea had just aroused in the crowd.
098.148 This is what had happened:
098.149 Andrea had very skillfully descended to the two-thirds of the chimney, but, arrived there, his foot had failed him, and, in spite of the support of his hands, he had descended with more speed and especially more noise than he would have liked. It would have been nothing if the room had been solitary; but unfortunately it was inhabited.
098.150 Two women were asleep in a bed; the noise had awakened them.
098.151 Their eyes were fixed on the point from which the noise came, and through the opening in the fireplace they saw a man appear.
098.152 It was one of the two women, the blond one, who had uttered that terrible cry from which the whole house had resounded, while the other, who was brown, had rushed to the bell, giving the alarm, shaking it with all her strength.
098.153 Andrea played, as one sees, with misfortune.
098.154 "For pity's sake!" he cried, pale, lost, without seeing the people he was addressing, "for pity's sake! don't call, save me! I don't want to hurt you.
098.155 --Andrea the murderer!" shouted one of the two young women.
098.156 --Eugenie! Miss Danglars!" murmured Cavalcanti, passing from fright to stupor.
098.157 --Help! help!" cried Mlle. d'Armilly, taking the bell from Eugenie's inert hands and ringing it with even more force than her companion.
098.158 --Save me, I am being pursued! said Andrea, joining her hands; for pity's sake, for mercy's sake, do not give me up!
098.159 --It's too late, we're going upstairs, replied Eugenie.
098.160 --Well, hide me somewhere, you will say that you were afraid without reason to be afraid; you will divert suspicion, and you will have saved my life."
098.161 The two women, huddled together wrapping themselves in their blankets, remained mute at this imploring voice; all apprehensions, all repugnancies collided in their minds.
098.162 "Well, so be it!" said Eugenie, "go back the way you came, you wretch; go away, and we will say nothing.
098.163 "Here he is! Here he is!" cried a voice on the landing, "here he is, I see him!"
098.164 Indeed, the brigadier had glued his eye to the lock, and had seen Andrea standing and pleading.
098.165 A violent blow of stick made jump the lock, two others made jump the bolts; the broken door fell in.
098.166 Andrea ran to the other door, giving on the gallery of the court, and opened it, ready to rush.
098.167 The two gendarmes were there with their rifles and laid him at gunpoint.
098.168 Andrea had stopped short; standing pale, his body tilted back a little, he held his useless knife in his clenched hand.
098.169 "Flee, then!" cried Mlle. d'Armilly, in whose heart pity was returning as fright was leaving it, "Flee, then!
098.170 --Or kill yourself!" said Eugenie in the tone and pose of one of those vestals who, in the circus, ordered the victorious gladiator with the thumb to finish off his downed adversary.
098.171 Andrea shuddered and looked at the girl with a smile of contempt which proved that her corruption did not understand this sublime ferocity of the honor.
098.172 "Kill me!" he said, throwing down his knife, "what for?
098.173 -But, you said it!" cried Mlle. Danglars, "you will be condemned to death, you will be executed like the last of the criminals!
098.174 --Bah!" replied Cavalcanti, crossing his arms, "we have friends."
098.175 The brigadier advanced toward him with his sword in his hand.
098.176 "Come on, come on," said Cavalcanti, "sheathe, my good man, there is no need to make so much fuss, since I surrender."
098.177 And he held out his hands to the handcuffs.
098.178 The two girls looked with terror at this hideous metamorphosis which was operated under their eyes, the man of the world stripping his envelope and becoming again the man of the prison.
098.179 Andrea turned to them, and with the smile of impudence
098.180 "Do you have some commission for your father, Miss Eugenie?" he said, "for in all probability I am returning to Paris."
098.181 Eugenie hid her head in both hands.
098.182 "Oh, oh," said Andrea, "there's nothing to be ashamed of, and I don't blame you for taking the post office to chase me... Wasn't I almost your husband?"
098.183 And on this taunt Andrea went out, leaving the two fugitives to suffer shame and the comments of the assembly.
098.184 An hour later, dressed both in their women's clothes, they climbed into their traveling carriage.
098.185 The door of the hotel had been closed to keep them from first sight; but when the door was opened, they had to pass through a double hedge of onlookers, their eyes blazing, their lips murmuring.
098.186 Eugenie lowered the blinds; but if she could no longer see, she could still hear, and the sound of the jeers reached her.
098.187 "Oh, why is the world not a desert?" she cried, throwing herself into Mlle. d'Armilly's arms, her eyes glittering with that rage which made Nero wish that the Roman world had only one head, so that he could cut it off at a single blow.
098.188 The next day they went down to the Hotel de Flandre in Brussels.
098.189 Since the day before, Andrea was imprisoned in the Conciergerie.
099.000 The law.
099.001 One saw with which peace Mlle Danglars and Mlle d'Armilly had been able to carry out their transformation and to operate their escape: it is that each one was too occupied with his own business to deal with theirs.
099.002 We will leave the banker, with sweat on his brow, to line up the enormous columns of his liabilities in front of the ghost of bankruptcy, and we will follow the baroness, who, after having remained for a moment crushed under the violence of the blow that had just struck her, had gone to find her ordinary adviser, Lucien Debray.
099.003 It is that in fact the baroness was counting on this marriage to abandon at last a guardianship which, with a daughter of Eugenie's character, was bound to be very awkward; it is that in these kinds of tacit contracts which maintain the hierarchical bond of the family, the mother is really only mistress of her daughter on condition that she is continually an example of wisdom and a type of perfection for her.
099. 004 Now, Mme. Danglars feared Eugénie's perspicacity and Mlle. d'Armilly's advice, she had surprised certain disdainful glances thrown by her daughter at Debray, glances which seemed to mean that her daughter knew all the mystery of her amorous and pecuniary relations with the private secretary, whereas a more sagacious and thorough interpretation would have, on the contrary, would have shown the baroness that Eugenie hated Debray, not because he was a stumbling block and a scandal in her father's house, but because she simply placed him in the category of those bipeds that Diagenes tried to stop calling men, and that Plato designated by the periphrase of two-footed and featherless animals
099.005 Mrs. Danglars, from her point of view, and unfortunately in this world everyone has his own point of view which prevents him from seeing the point of view of others, Mrs. Danglars, from her point of view, we say, therefore infinitely regretted that Eugenie's marriage had failed, not because this marriage was suitable, well matched and was to make her daughter happy, but because this marriage gave her back her freedom.
099.006 She therefore ran, as we have said, to Debray, who, after having, like all of Paris, attended the evening of the contract and the scandal which had been the result, had hastened to retire to his club, where, with a few friends, he was talking about the event which was at that hour the talk of three quarters of this eminently gossipy city which is called the capital of the world.
099. 007 At the moment when Mrs. Danglars, dressed in a black dress and hidden under a veil, was climbing the stairs that led to Debray's apartment, despite the certainty that the concierge had given her that the young man was not at home, Debray was busy fending off the insinuations of a friend who was trying to prove to him that after the terrible outburst that had just taken place, it was his duty as a friend of the house to marry Mlle. Eugénie Danglars and her two millions.
099. 008 Debray defended himself as a man who asks nothing better than to be defeated; for often this idea had presented itself to his mind, and then, as he knew Eugenie, her independent and haughty character, he resumed from time to time a completely defensive attitude, saying that this union was impossible, while nevertheless allowing himself to be deafly tickled by the evil idea which, according to all moralists, incessantly preoccupies the most probing, and purest, man, keeping watch in the depths of his soul as Satan keeps watch behind the cross. The tea, the game, the conversation, which was interesting, as one can see, since such serious interests were being discussed, lasted until one o'clock in the morning.
099.009 During this time, Mme. Danglars, introduced by Lucien's valet, waited, veiled and palpitating, in the little green room between two baskets of flowers which she herself had sent in the morning, and which Debray, it must be said, had himself arranged, tiered, and pruned with a care that made the poor woman forgive her absence.
099.010 At eleven forty minutes, Mrs. Danglars, tired of waiting in vain, got back into the carriage and was driven home.
099.011 Women of a certain world have that in common with the grisettes in good fortune, that they do not usually return after midnight. The baroness entered the hotel with as much caution as Eugenie had just taken to leave; she climbed lightly, and with a heavy heart, the stairs to her apartment, which, as we know, adjoined Eugenie's.
099.012 She dreaded so much to provoke some comment; she believed so firmly, poor respectable woman in this point at least, in the innocence of her daughter and in her fidelity for the paternal hearth!
099.013 Returning home, she listened at Eugenie's door, then, hearing no sound, she tried to enter; but the locks were on.
099.014 Mrs. Danglars thought that Eugenie, tired from the terrible emotions of the evening, had gone to bed and was sleeping.
099.015 She called the maid and asked her.
099.016 "Miss Eugenie," replied the chambermaid, "went back to her apartment with Miss d'Armilly, and then they had tea together; after which they dismissed me, saying that they had no further need of me."
099.017 From that moment the maid was in the pantry, and, like everyone else, she thought the two young people were in the apartment.
099.018 Mrs. Danglars therefore went to bed without the shadow of a suspicion; but, tranquil about the individuals, her mind went back to the event.
099.019 As her thoughts cleared in her head, the proportions of the scene of the contract grew; it was no longer a scandal, it was an uproar; it was no longer a shame, it was an ignominy.
099.020 In spite of herself then, the baroness remembered that she had been without pity for poor Mercédès, who had once been struck down, in her husband and son, by such a great misfortune.
099.021 "Eugenie," she said to herself, "is lost, and so are we. The affair, as it is going to be presented, covers us with opprobrium; for in a society like ours, certain ridicules are living, bleeding, incurable wounds.
099.022 "How fortunate," she murmured, "that God should have made Eugenie this strange character which has so often made me tremble!"
099.023 And her grateful gaze was raised to heaven, whose mysterious Providence disposes of everything in advance according to the events that must happen, and from a defect, from a vice even, sometimes makes a happiness.
099.024 Then his thought crossed the space, as does, by extending its wings, the bird of an abyss, and stopped on Cavalcanti.
099.025 "This Andrea was a wretch, a thief, a murderer; and yet this Andrea possessed manners which indicated a half education, if not a complete education; this Andrea had presented himself in the world with the appearance of great fortune, with the support of honorable names."
099.026 How to see clearly in this maze? To whom to address to leave this cruel position?
099.027 Debray, to whom she had run with the first impulse of the woman who seeks help in the man she loves and who sometimes loses her, Debray could only give her advice; it was to some other more powerful than he that she should turn.
099.028 The baroness then thought of M. de Villefort.
099.029 It was M. de Villefort who had wanted to have Cavalcanti arrested, it was M. de Villefort who without pity had brought trouble into the midst of his family as if it had been a foreign family.
099.030 But no; on reflection, it was not a man without pity that the king's prosecutor; it was a magistrate slave to his duties, a loyal and firm friend who, brutally, but with a sure hand, had struck the scalpel blow into the corruption: it was not an executioner, it was a surgeon, a surgeon who had wanted to isolate in the eyes of the world the honor of the Danglars from the ignominy of this lost young man whom they had presented to the world as their son-in-law.
099.031 From the moment that M. de Villefort, a friend of the Danglars family, acted in this way, there was no longer any reason to suppose that the king's prosecutor had known anything in advance and had lent himself to any of Andrea's schemes.
099.032 Villefort's conduct, on reflection, still appeared to the baroness in a light that could be explained to their common advantage.
099.033 But there the inflexibility of the public prosecutor was to stop; she would go to him the next day and obtain from him, if not that he failed in his duties as a magistrate, at least that he left them all the latitude of indulgence.
099.034 The baroness would invoke the past; she would rejuvenate her memories, she would beg in the name of a guilty but happy time; M. de Villefort would calm the matter down, or at least he would let Cavalcanti go (and, to achieve this, he had only to turn his eyes to another side), or at least he would let Cavalcanti flee, and would only pursue the crime on that shadow of a criminal which is called contumacy.
099.035 Only then did she fall asleep more quietly.
099.036 The next day, at nine o'clock, she got up, and without ringing her maid, without giving any sign of existence to anyone in the world, she dressed, and, dressed with the same simplicity as the day before, she went down the stairs, left the hotel, walked to the Rue de Provence, got into a carriage, and had herself driven to M. de Villefort's house.
099.037 For a month this accursed house had presented the gloomy aspect of a lazaretto where the plague had broken out; part of the apartments were closed inside and out; the shutters, closed, were only opened for a moment to give air; then one would see the frightened head of a lackey appear at this window; then the window closed again like the slab of a tomb falling on a sepulchre, and the neighbors said to each other in a low voice:
099.038 "Are we going to see a beer coming out of the house of M. le procureur du roi again today?"
099.039 Mrs. Danglars was seized with a shudder at the sight of that desolate house; she got out of her carriage, and, with bending knees, approached the closed door and rang the bell.
099.040 It was not until the third time the bell rang, whose mournful tinkle seemed to participate in the general sadness, that a janitor appeared, opening the door just wide enough to allow his words to pass.
099.041 He saw a woman, a woman of the world, an elegantly dressed woman, and yet the door continued to remain almost closed.
099.042 "But open up!" said the baroness.
099.043 -First of all, madam, who are you?" asked the concierge.
099.044 --Who am I? But you know me well.
099.045 --We don't know anyone anymore, ma'am.
099.046 --But you are mad, my friend!
099.047 --Where did you come from?
099.048 --Oh, that's too strong.
099.049 --Madam, it is the order, excuse me; your name?
099.050 --Mrs. Baroness Danglars. You have seen me twenty times.
099.051 --It is possible, madam; now what do you want?
099.052 --Oh, how strange you are! and I will complain to M. de Villefort of the impertinence of his people.
099.053 --Madame, it is not impertinence, it is precaution: no one enters here without a word from M. d'Avrigny, or without having to speak to the King's prosecutor.
099.054 -- Well, it's precisely the King's Prosecutor that I'm dealing with.
099.055 -- Urgent business?
099.056 -- You must see that, since I haven't yet got back into my car. But let us finish: here is my card, take it to your master.
099.057 --Will Madame wait for me to return?
099.058 --Yes, go on."
099.059 The concierge closed the door, leaving Mrs. Danglars in the street.
099.060 The baroness, it is true, did not wait long; a moment later, the door reopened wide enough to give the baroness passage: she passed, and the door closed behind her.
099.061 Having arrived in the courtyard, the janitor, without losing sight of the door for a moment, drew a whistle from his pocket and whistled.
099.062 M. de Villefort's valet appeared on the stoop.
099.063 "Madame will excuse this good man," he said, coming to meet the baroness: "but his orders are precise, and M. de Villefort has charged me to tell Madame that he could not do otherwise than he had done."
099.064 In the courtyard was a supplier introduced with the same precautions, and whose goods were being examined.
099.065 The baroness went up the staircase; she felt deeply impressed by this sadness which widened, so to speak, the circle of her own, and, still guided by the valet, she was introduced, without her guide having lost sight of her, into the magistrate's chamber.
099.066 However preoccupied Mme. Danglars was with the reason for bringing her, the reception she was given by all the valetaille seemed so unworthy that she began by complaining.
099.067 But Villefort lifted his head, weighed down by pain, and looked at her with such a sad smile that the complaints expired on his lips.
099.068 "Excuse my servants for a terror of which I cannot make them a crime: suspected, they have become suspicious."
099.069 Mrs. Danglars had often heard in the world of this terror which the magistrate accused; but she could never have believed, had she not had the experience of her own eyes, that this feeling could be carried to this point.
099.070 "You too," she said, "are unhappy?
099.071 --Yes, ma'am," replied the magistrate.
099.072 --So you pity me?
099.073 --Sincerely, madam.
099.074 --And you understand what brings me here?
099.075 --You've come to tell me what's happening to you, haven't you?
099.076 -- Yes, sir, a terrible misfortune.
099.077 --I mean a misfortune.
099.078 --A misadventure!" cried the baroness.
099.079 -- "Alas, madam," replied the king's prosecutor, with his imperturbable calm, "I have come to call only irreparable things a misfortune.
099.080 --Eh! sir, do you think they will forget?
099.081 - "Everything is forgotten, madame," said Villefort; "your daughter's marriage will take place tomorrow, if it does not take place today, in eight days, if it does not take place tomorrow. And as for regretting Miss Eugenie's future, I don't believe that such is your idea."
099.082 Mme. Danglars looked at Villefort, astonished to see him with this almost mocking calmness.
099.083 "Have I come to a friend's house?" she asked in a tone full of painful dignity.
099.084 --You know I have, madam," replied Villefort, whose cheeks became slightly flushed at this assurance he gave.
099.085 Indeed, this assurance alluded to other events than those which occupied him and the baroness at this hour.
099.086 "Well, then," said the baroness, "be more affectionate, my dear Villefort; speak to me as a friend and not as a magistrate, and when I find myself deeply unhappy, do not tell me that I must be cheerful."
099.087 Villefort bowed.
099.088 "When I hear of misfortunes, madame," he said, "I have for the last three months acquired the unfortunate habit of thinking of my own, and then this selfish operation of the parallel is done in spite of myself in my mind. That is why, next to my misfortunes, yours seemed to me a misfortune; that is why, next to my disastrous position, yours seemed to me a position to be envied; but that upsets you, let us leave it. You were saying, madam?
099.089 -- I have come to know from you, my friend," continued the baroness, "what has become of this impostor?
099.090 --Imposter!" repeated Villefort; "decidedly, madam, it is a parti pris with you to attenuate certain things and to exaggerate others; impostor, M. Andrea Cavalcanti, or rather M. Benedetto! You are mistaken, Madam, Mr. Benedetto is indeed a murderer.
099.091 --Sir, I do not deny the correctness of your rectification; but the more severely you arm yourself against this unfortunate man, the more you will strike our family. Let's forget about him for a moment, instead of pursuing him, let him run away.
099.092 --You are too late, madam, the orders have already been given.
099.093 -- Well, if he is arrested... Do you think he will be arrested?
099.094 -- I hope so.
099.095 --If he is arrested (listen, I always hear that the jails are full), well, let him stay in jail."
099.096 The King's Attorney made a negative movement.
099.097 "At least until my daughter is married," added the baroness.
099.098 --Impossible, madam; justice has its formalities.
099.099 --Even for me?" said the baroness, half smiling, half serious.
099.100 --For all, replied Villefort; and for myself as well as for the others.
099.101 --Ah!" said the baroness, without adding in words what her thought had just betrayed by this exclamation.
099.102 Villefort looked at her with that look with which he probed her thoughts.
099.103 "Yes, I know what you mean," he resumed, "you are alluding to these terrible rumors spread throughout the world, that all these deaths which for three months have clothed me in mourning; that this death from which Valentine has just escaped, as if by a miracle, is not natural.
099.104 -- I was not thinking of that," said Mrs. Danglars sharply.
099.105 -Yes, you were thinking about it, madam, and that was justice, for you could not do otherwise than think about it, and you said to yourself softly: You who pursue crime answer: Why then are there crimes around you that go unpunished?"
099.106 The baroness turned pale.
099.107 "You were saying that to yourself, weren't you, madam?
099.108 -- Well, I admit it.
099.109 --I will answer you."
099.110 Villefort drew his chair closer to Mme. Danglars' chair; then, leaning both hands on his desk, and taking a more muted intonation than usual:
099.111 "There are crimes that go unpunished," he said, "because we do not know the criminals, and we fear to strike an innocent head for a guilty one; but when these criminals are known (Villefort stretched out his hand toward a crucifix placed in front of his desk), when these criminals are known," he repeated, "by the living God, madame, whoever they are, they will die! Now, after the oath I have just taken and which I will keep, madam, dare to ask me for mercy for this wretch!
099.112 -- "Sir," said Madame Danglars, "are you sure that he is as guilty as they say?
099.113 -- Listen, here is his file: Benedetto, sentenced first to five years on the galleys for forgery, at sixteen years of age; the young man promised, as you see; then escaped, then murdered.
099.114 --And who is this wretch?
099.115 --How do we know that! A vagrant, a Corsican.
099.116 --So he was not claimed by anyone?
099.117 -- By no one; we don't know his parents.
099.118 --But that man who came from Lucca?
099.119 --Another swindler like him; his accomplice perhaps."
099.120 The baroness clasped her hands.
099.121 "Villefort!" she said with her softest and most caressing intonation.
099.122 "For God's sake, madam," replied the king's prosecutor, with a firmness that was not free of dryness, "for God's sake, never ask me for mercy for a guilty man.
099.123 "What am I? the law. Does the law have eyes to see your sadness? Does the law have ears to hear your sweet voice? Does the law have a memory to apply your delicate thoughts? No, madam, the law orders, and when the law has ordered, it strikes.
099.124 "You will tell me that I am a living being and not a code; a man, and not a volume. Have men treated me as a brother? Have they loved me? Have they spared me? Has anyone asked for mercy for M. de Villefort, and has anyone been granted mercy for M. de Villefort? No, no, no! struck, always struck!
099.125 "You persist, woman, that is to say, siren that you are, in speaking to me with that charming and expressive eye which reminds me that I must blush. Well, so be it, yes, blush at what you know, and perhaps, perhaps at something else.
099.126 "But finally, since I have failed myself, and perhaps more deeply than others, well, since that time I have shaken the clothes of others to find the ulcer, and I have always found it, and I will say more, I have found it with happiness, with joy, this stamp of human weakness or perversity.
099.127 "For every man I recognized as guilty, and every guilty man I struck, seemed to me a living proof, a new proof that I was not a hideous exception! Alas! alas! alas! everyone is wicked, madam, let us prove it and strike the wicked!"
099.128 Villefort pronounced these last words with a feverish rage which gave his language a fierce eloquence.
099.129 "But," resumed Mme. Danglars, trying to make a last effort, "you say that this young man is a vagabond, an orphan, abandoned by all?
099.130 -Too bad, too bad, or rather too good; Providence made him so that no one would have to weep over him.
099.131 - That's picking on the weak, sir.
099.132 --The weak one who murders!
099.133 --His disgrace would reflect on my house.
099.134 -- Don't I have death in my house?
099.135 --Oh, sir!" cried the baroness, "you are merciless to others. Well, I tell you, we will be merciless to you!
099.136 --So be it!" said Villefort, raising his arm to heaven with a threatening gesture.
099.137 --At least put the case of this unfortunate man, if he is arrested, before the next court; that will give us six months to forget.
099.138 -- No, not at all, said Villefort; I still have five days; the investigation is done; five days is more time than I need; besides, don't you understand, madame, that I too must forget? Well, when I work, and I work night and day, when I work, there are moments when I don't remember, and when I don't remember, I am happy in the manner of the dead: but that is even better than suffering.
099.139 --Sir, he has run away; let him run away, inertia is an easy mercy.
099.140 --But I told you it was too late! At daybreak the telegraph played, and at this hour...
099.141 --Monsieur," said the valet as he entered, "a dragoon brings this dispatch from the Minister of the Interior."
099.142 Villefort seized the letter and opened it briskly. Mme Danglars shuddered with terror. Villefort shuddered with joy.
099.143 "Arrested!" cried Villefort; "he has been arrested at Compiègne; it is all over."
099.144 Mme. Danglars rose cold and pale.
099.145 "Farewell, sir," she said.
099.146 --Farewell, madam," replied the king's prosecutor, almost cheerfully as he led her back to the door.
099.147 Then returning to his office:
099.148 "Come on," he said, striking the letter with the back of his right hand, "I had a forgery, I had three robberies, I had three arsons, all I needed was an assassination, here it is; the session will be beautiful."
100.000 The appearance.
100.001 As the public prosecutor had said to Mrs. Danglars, Valentine had not yet recovered.
100.002 Broken by tiredness, she kept to her bed, and it was in her room, and from Mme de Villefort's mouth, that she learned the events we have just recounted, that is to say, Eugenie's escape and the arrest of Andrea Cavalcanti, or rather of Benedetto, as well as the accusation of assassination brought against him.
100.003 But Valentine was so weak that this story did not perhaps have all the effect on her that it would have produced in her usual state of health.
100.004 Indeed, it was only a few vague ideas, a few more indecisive forces mixed with the strange ideas and fleeting phantoms that were born in her sick brain or passed before her eyes, and soon everything faded away to let the personal sensations regain all their strength.
100.005 During the day, Valentine was still kept in reality by the presence of Noirtier, who had himself carried to his granddaughter's house and remained there, covering Valentine with his paternal gaze; then, when he had returned from the Palace, it was Villefort's turn to spend an hour or two between his father and his child.
100.006 At six o'clock Villefort retired to his study, at eight o'clock M. d'Avrigny arrived, who himself brought the nightly potion prepared for the young girl; then Noirtier was taken away.
100.007 A guard of the doctor's choice replaced everyone, and only withdrew himself when, towards ten or eleven o'clock, Valentine was asleep.
100.008 When she came downstairs, she gave the keys to Valentine's room to M. de Villefort himself, so that one could only enter the patient's room by passing through Mme de Villefort's apartment and little Edward's room.
100.009 Every morning Morrel came to Noirtier's house to get news of Valentine: but Morrel, extraordinarily, seemed less worried every day.
100.010 At first, Valentine, though in the grip of a violent nervous exaltation, was getting better day by day; then, had not Monte Cristo told him, when he had run to his house all distraught, that if in two hours Valentine was not dead, Valentine would be saved?
100.011 Now, Valentine was still alive, and four days had passed.
100.012 This nervous exaltation of which we spoke pursued Valentine even in her sleep, or rather in the state of somnolence which followed her vigil: it was then that, in the silence of the night and the half-darkness which the night-light placed on the chimney and burning in its alabaster envelope allowed to reign, she saw passing those shadows which come to populate the room of the sick and which the fever shakes with its shivering wings.
100.013 Then it seemed to her to see appearing sometimes her mother-in-law who threatened her, sometimes Morrel who held out his arms to her, sometimes beings almost foreign to her usual life, like the Count of Monte Cristo; there was not even the furniture which, in these moments of delirium, did not seem mobile and wandering; and it lasted thus until two or three o'clock in the morning, moment when a leaden sleep came to seize the young girl and led her until the day.
100. 014 The evening which followed that morning when Valentine had learned of Eugenie's flight and Benedetto's arrest, and when, after having mingled for a moment with the sensations of her own existence, these events began to leave her mind little by little, after the successive retreat of Villefort, d'Avrigny, and Noirtier, while eleven o'clock was ringing at Saint-Philippe-du-Roule, and the guard, having placed the drink prepared by the doctor under the patient's hand, and closed the door of her room, was listening with a shudder to the comments of the servants in the office where she had retired, and was filling her memory with the gloomy stories which, for three months, had filled the evenings of the king's anteroom, an unexpected scene was taking place in this room, which had been so carefully closed.
100.015 It had already been about ten minutes since the guard had withdrawn.
100.016 Valentine, prey for an hour to this fever which returned every night, let her head, insubordinate to her will, continue this active, monotonous and implacable work of the brain, which exhausts itself to reproduce incessantly the same thoughts or to give birth to the same images.
100.017 From the wick of the night-light sprang a thousand and one radiations, all imbued with strange meanings, when all of a sudden, in its trembling reflection, Valentine thought she saw her bookcase, placed next to the fireplace, in a recess of the wall, slowly open without the hinges on which it seemed to roll producing the slightest noise.
100.018 In another moment, Valentine would have seized her bell and would have drawn the silk cord while calling for help: but nothing surprised her any more in the situation where she was. She was conscious that all these visions which surrounded her were the daughters of her delirium, and this conviction had come to her from the fact that, in the morning, no trace had ever remained of all these phantoms of the night, which disappeared with the day.
100.019 Behind the door appeared a human figure.
100.020 Valentine was, thanks to her fever, too familiar with these kinds of apparitions to be frightened; she only opened her eyes wide, hoping to recognize Morrel.
100.021 The figure continued to move towards her bed, then stopped, and seemed to listen with deep attention.
100.022 At that moment, a reflection from the night-light played on the face of the nocturnal visitor.
100.023 "It's not him!" she murmured.
100.024 And she waited, convinced that she was dreaming, that this man, as it happens in dreams, disappeared or changed into some other person.
100.025 Only she touched her pulse, and, feeling it beat violently, she remembered that the best way to make these unwelcome visions disappear was to drink: the coolness of the drink, made up moreover with the aim of calming the agitations of which Valentine had complained to the doctor, brought, by making the fever fall, a renewal of the sensations of the brain; when she had drunk, for a moment she suffered less.
100.026 Valentine therefore stretched out her hand to take her glass from the crystal cup where it lay; but as she stretched out her shivering arm from the bed, the apparition again took two steps towards the bed, and came so close to the girl that she heard his breath and thought she felt the pressure of his hand.
100.027 This time the illusion or rather the reality exceeded all that Valentine had experienced until then; she began to believe herself quite awake and quite alive; she was aware that she was enjoying all her reason, and she shuddered.
100.028 The pressure that Valentine had felt had the aim of stopping her arm.
100.029 Valentine withdrew it slowly to her.
100.030 Then this figure, whose glance could not be detached, and which besides seemed rather protective than threatening, this figure took the glass, approached the pilot light and looked at the drink, as if it wanted to judge its transparency and limpidity.
100.031 But this first test was not enough.
100.032 This man, or rather this ghost, for he walked so softly that the carpet muffled the sound of his steps, this man drew a spoonful of the drink from the glass and swallowed it. Valentine looked at what passed in front of his eyes with a deep feeling of amazement.
100.033 She believed well that all that was close to disappear to make place with another table; but the man, instead of fading like a shade, approached her, and tending the glass to Valentine, of a voice full of emotion:
100.034 "Now," he said, "drink!..."
100.035 Valentine flinched.
100.036 It was the first time that one of her visions spoke to her with this living tone.
100.037 She opened her mouth to let out a scream.
100.038 The man put a finger on her lips.
100.039 "Mr. Count of Monte Cristo!" she murmured.
100.040 From the fright that was painted in the girl's eyes, from the trembling of her hands, from the quick gesture she made to huddle under her sheets, one could recognize the last struggle of doubt against conviction; however, the presence of Monte Cristo in her home at such an hour, his mysterious, fantastic, inexplicable entrance through a wall, seemed impossibilities to Valentine's shaken reason.
100.041 "Don't call, don't be frightened," said the Count, "don't even have in the bottom of your heart the flash of a suspicion or the shadow of an anxiety; the man you see before you (for this time you are right, Valentine, and it is not an illusion), the man you see before you is the most tender father and the most respectful friend you can dream of."
100.042 Valentine found nothing to answer: she was so afraid of this voice, which revealed to her the real presence of the one who spoke, that she dreaded to associate her own with it; but her frightened look wanted to say: If your intentions are pure, why are you here?
100.043 With his marvelous sagacity, the Count understood everything that was going on in the girl's heart.
100.044 "Listen to me," he said, "or rather look at me: see my reddened eyes and my face even paler than usual; it is that for four nights I have not closed my eyes for a single moment; for four nights I have been watching over you, protecting you, preserving you for our friend Maximilian."
100.045 A stream of joyous blood rose rapidly to the cheeks of the patient; for the name which the Count had just pronounced removed from her the remnant of distrust which he had inspired in her.
100.046 "Maximilien!" repeated Valentine, so sweet did the name seem to her to pronounce; "Maximilien! has he confessed everything to you?
100.047 -Everything. He told me that your life was his, and I promised him that you would live.
100.048 --You promised him that I would live?
100.049 --Yes.
100.050 -- Indeed, sir, you just spoke of vigilance and protection. Are you a doctor then?
100.051 -- Yes, the best that Heaven can send you at this time, believe me.
100.052 --You say you have been keeping watch?" asked Valentine in concern; "where? I have not seen you."
100.053 The Count stretched out his hand in the direction of the library.
100.054 "I was hidden behind this door," he said; "this door leads into the neighboring house which I have rented."
100.055 Valentine, with a movement of prudish pride, averted her eyes, and with sovereign terror:
100.056 "Sir," she said, "what you have done is of unexampled insanity, and this protection you have given me looks very much like an insult.
100.057 --Valentine, he said, during this long vigil, these were the only things I saw: what people came to your house, what food was prepared for you, what drinks were served to you; then, when these drinks seemed dangerous to me, I entered as I have just entered, emptied your glass, and substituted for the poison a beneficent beverage, which, instead of the death that was prepared for you, caused life to circulate in your veins.
100.058-Poison! Death!" cried Valentine, thinking herself once more under the influence of some feverish hallucination; "what are you saying, sir?
100.059 - "Hush, my child," said Monte Cristo, bringing his finger to his lips again, "I said poison; yes, I said death, and I repeat death, but first drink this. (The Count drew from his pocket a bottle containing a red liquor, and poured a few drops into the glass.) And when you have drunk it, take nothing more all night."
100.060 Valentine put forth his hand; but scarcely had it touched the glass, than she withdrew it with fright.
100.061 Monte Cristo took the glass, drank half of it, and presented it to Valentine, who swallowed the rest of the liquor it contained with a smile.
100.062 "Oh, yes," she said, "I recognize the taste of my nocturnal beverages, of that water which gave a little freshness to my chest, a little calm to my brain. Thank you, sir, thank you.
100.063 --That is how you lived for four nights, Valentine," said the Count. But me, how did I live? Oh, the cruel hours you made me spend! Oh, the frightful tortures you made me undergo, when I saw the mortal poison poured into your glass, when I trembled that you would not have time to drink it before I had time to pour it into the fireplace!
100.064 -- "You say, sir," resumed Valentine at the height of his terror, "that you suffered a thousand tortures when you saw the deadly poison poured into my glass? But if you saw the poison poured into my glass, you must have seen the person who poured it?
100.065 --Yes."
100.066 Valentine raised herself on her feet, and bringing the embroidered batiste over her chest paler than snow, still moist with the cold sweat of delirium, with which the still colder sweat of terror was beginning to mingle:
100.067 "Did you see her?" repeated the girl.
100.068 --Yes," said the Count a second time.
100.069 -What you are telling me is horrible, sir, what you want me to believe is infernal. What! in my father's house, what! in my room, what! on my bed of suffering they continue to murder me? Oh, withdraw, sir, you are tempting my conscience, you are blaspheming the divine goodness, it is impossible, it cannot be.
100.070 --Are you the first one to be struck by this hand, Valentine? Have you not seen M. de Saint-Méran, Mme. de Saint-Méran, and Barrois fall around you? Would you not have seen M. Noirtier fall, if the treatment he has been undergoing for nearly three years had not protected him by fighting poison with the habit of poison?
100.071 --Oh, my God!" said Valentine, "is that why, for nearly a month now, my good father has demanded that I share all his drinks?
100.072 --And these drinks," cried Monte Cristo, "taste as bitter as a half-dried orange peel, don't they?
100.073 --Yes, my God, yes!
100.074 --Oh, that explains it all," said Monte Cristo, "he too knows that people are being poisoned here, and perhaps who is poisoning.
100.075 "He has protected you, his beloved child, against the deadly substance, and the deadly substance has come to blunt against this beginning of habit! That is how you are still living, which I could not explain to myself, after having been poisoned four days ago with a poison that usually does not forgive.
100.076 --But who is the assassin, the murderer?
100.077 -- I will ask you in turn: Have you never seen anyone enter your room at night?
100.078 -- I have. I have often thought I saw shadows passing by, shadows approaching, moving away, disappearing; but I took them to be visions of my fever, and just now, when you yourself came in, well, I thought for a long time either that I was delirious or that I was dreaming.
100.079 -- So you don't know the person who is after your life?
100.080 --No, says Valentine, why would anyone want me dead?
100.081 --You will know her then, said Monte Cristo, lending an ear.
100.082 --How so? asked Valentine, looking around in terror.
100.083 --Because tonight you have no more fever or delirium, because tonight you are wide awake, because it is midnight and it is the hour of the assassins.
100.084 -My God! my God!" said Valentine, wiping with her hand the sweat that beaded on her forehead.
100.085 Indeed, midnight was ringing slowly and sadly, it seemed as if each blow of the bronze hammer was striking the heart of the young girl.
100.086 "Valentine," continued the Count, "call all your strength to your aid, compress your heart in your chest, stop your voice in your throat, feign sleep, and you will see, you will see!
100.087 Valentine seized the Count's hand.
100.088 "It seems to me that I hear a noise," she said, "withdraw!
100.089 --Farewell, or rather good-bye," replied the Count.
100.090 Then, with a smile so sad and so paternal that the heart of the young girl was penetrated with gratitude, he returned on tiptoe to the library door.
100.091 But, turning around before closing it on him:
100.092 "Don't make a move," he said, "don't say a word, let them think you're asleep, otherwise perhaps they'd kill you before I had time to run."
100.093 And, on this frightful injunction, the count disappeared behind the door, which closed silently on him.
101.000 Locust.
101.001 Valentine was left alone; two other clocks, behind that of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule, struck midnight again at different distances.
101.002 Then, except for the rustling of a few distant cars, all fell back into silence.
101.003 Then all Valentine's attention was concentrated on the clock in her room, whose pendulum was marking the seconds.
101.004 She began to count these seconds and noticed that they were twice as slow as her heartbeat. And yet she still doubted; the harmless Valentine could not imagine that anyone wished her dead; why? for what purpose? what harm had she done that could cause her an enemy?
101.005 There was no fear that she would fall asleep.
101.006 Only one idea, a terrible idea, held her mind in tension: that there was a person in the world who had tried to murder her and who would try again.
101.007 If this time this person, tired of seeing the ineffectiveness of poison, was going to have recourse to iron, as Monte Cristo had said, if the Count was not going to have time to run to him, if he was approaching his last moment, if he was not going to see Morrel again.
101.008 At this thought, which covered her at once with a livid pallor and an icy sweat, Valentine was ready to seize the cord of the bell and call for help.
101.009 But it seemed to her, through the door of the library, to see the eye of the Count sparkling, that eye which weighed on her memory, and which, when she thought of it, crushed her with such shame, that she wondered if gratitude would ever succeed in erasing this painful effect of the Count's indiscreet friendship.
101.010 Twenty minutes, twenty eternities passed in this way, then another ten minutes; at last the clock, crying out a second in advance, finally struck a blow on the sonorous bell.
101.011 At this very moment, an imperceptible scratching of the nail on the wood of the bookcase told Valentine that the Count was keeping watch and recommended that she do so.
101.012 Indeed, on the opposite side, that is to say towards Edward's room, it seemed to Valentine that she heard the floor shouting; she lent her ear, holding her almost choked breath; the knob of the lock creaked and the door turned on its hinges.
101.013 Valentine had raised herself on her elbow, she had only time to let herself fall back on her bed and to hide her eyes under her arm.
101.014 Then, trembling, agitated, the heart tightened of an inexpressible fear, she waited.
101.015 Someone approached the bed and touched the curtains.
101.016 Valentine gathered all his forces and let hear this regular murmur of the breathing which announces a quiet sleep.
101.017 "Valentine!" said a voice.
101.018 The girl shivered to the bottom of her heart, but did not answer.
101.019 "Valentine!" repeated the same voice.
101.020 Same silence: Valentine had promised not to wake up.
101.021 Then all remained motionless.
101.022 Only Valentine heard the almost insensible noise of a liquor falling into the glass she had just emptied.
101.023 Then she dared, under the rampart of her extended arm, to open her eyelid.
101.024 Then she saw a woman in a white robe, who was emptying into her glass a liquor prepared in advance in a flask.
101.025 During this short moment, Valentine perhaps held her breath or undoubtedly made some movement, because the woman, worried, stopped and bent over her bed to better see if she was really sleeping: it was Mme de Villefort.
101.026 Valentine, recognizing her mother-in-law, was seized by a sharp shiver which caused her bed to move.
101.027 Madame de Villefort faded away at once along the wall, and there, sheltered behind the curtain of the bed, mute, attentive, she spied the least movement of Valentine.
101.028 This one remembered the terrible words of Monte-Cristo; it had seemed to her, in the hand which did not hold the vial, to see shining a kind of long and sharp knife. Then Valentine, calling all the power of her will to her aid, endeavored to close her eyes; but, this function of the most fearful of our senses, this function, so simple ordinarily, became at this moment almost impossible to accomplish, so much did avid curiosity make efforts to push back this eyelid and to attract the truth.
101.029 However, assured, by the silence in which the even sound of Valentine's breathing had resumed, that she was asleep, Mme. de Villefort extended her arm again, and remaining half concealed by the curtains gathered at the bedside, she finished emptying into Valentine's glass the contents of her flask.
101.030 Then she withdrew, without the slightest noise alerting Valentine that she had left.
101.031 She had seen the arm disappear, that's all; this fresh and rounded arm of a woman of twenty-five, young and beautiful, and who was pouring death.
101.032 It is impossible to express what Valentine had felt during the minute and a half that Mme de Villefort had remained in her room.
101.033 The scratching of a fingernail on the bookcase drew the young girl out of that state of torpor in which she was buried, and which resembled numbness.
101.034 She raised her head with effort.
101.035 The door, still silent, rolled a second time on its hinges, and the Count of Monte Cristo appeared again.
101.036 "Well," asked the Count, "do you still doubt?
101.037 -- Oh my God!" murmured the young girl.
101.038 --Did you see?
101.039 -- Alas!
101.040 --You recognized?"
101.041 Valentine gave a groan.
101.042 "Yes," she said, "but I cannot believe it.
101.043 --You would rather die then, and have Maximilian die!...
101.044 --My God, my God! repeated the young girl almost lost; but can't I leave the house, save myself?...
101.045 --Valentine, the hand that pursues you will reach you everywhere: by dint of gold, your servants will be seduced, and death will offer itself to you, disguised in every aspect, in the water that you will drink from the spring, in the fruit that you will pick from the tree.
101.046 - But didn't you say that my father's precaution had protected me against poison?
101.047 --Against a poison, and still not used in large doses; we will change the poison or increase the dose."
101.048 He took the glass and dipped his lips in it.
101.049 "And here," he said, "it is already done. It's no longer brucine they're poisoning you with, it's a simple narcotic. I recognize the taste of the alcohol in which it was dissolved. If you had drunk what Mme de Villefort has just poured into this glass, Valentine, you were lost.
101.050 -But, my God!" cried the young girl, "why is she pursuing me like this?
101.051 --How can you be so sweet, so good, so little believer in evil that you have not understood, Valentine?
101.052 --No, said the girl; I have never done her any harm.
101.053 --But you are rich, Valentine; but you have two hundred thousand pounds of income, and these two hundred thousand francs of income, you take away from his son.
101.054 --How so? My fortune is not his and comes to me from my parents.
101.055 --Surely, and that is why M. and Mme. de Saint-Méran died: it was so that you would inherit from your parents; that is why, from the day he made you his heiress, M. Noirtier had been condemned; that is why, in your turn, you must die, Valentine, it is so that your father will inherit from you, and that your brother, now an only child, will inherit from your father.
101.056 -- Edward! poor child, and it is for him that all these crimes are committed?
101.057 --Ah, you understand, at last.
101.058 --Ah, my God! I hope it doesn't all fall on him!
101.059 --You are an angel, Valentine.
101.060 --But my grandfather, did they give up killing him?
101.061 -- It was thought that, unless you were exiled, the fortune naturally went to your brother, and it was thought that, since the crime was useless, it was doubly dangerous to commit it.
101.062 --And it is in the mind of a woman that such a combination was born! O my God! my God!
101.063 --Remember Perugia, the trellis of the Post Office Inn, the man with the brown coat, whom your mother-in-law questioned about the aqua-tofana; well, from that time on, all this infernal project was ripening in his brain.
101.064 --Oh, sir," cried the sweet young girl, bursting into tears, "I can see that, if this is so, I am condemned to die.
101.065 --No, Valentine, no, for I have foreseen all the plots; no, for our enemy is vanquished, since she is guessed; no, you will live, Valentine, you will live to love and be loved, you will live to be happy and make a noble heart happy; but to live, Valentine, you must have great confidence in me.
101.066 --Order, sir, what must be done?
101.067 -- You must take blindly what I give you.
101.068 -- As God is my witness," cried Valentine, "if I were alone, I would rather let myself die!
101.069 --You will not confide in anyone, not even your father.
101.070 -My father is not part of this awful plot, is he, sir? said Valentine, joining her hands.
101.071 -- No, and yet your father, the man accustomed to legal accusations, your father must suspect that all these deaths that are befalling his house are not natural. Your father, he is the one who should have been watching over you, he is the one who should have been in my place at this hour, he is the one who should have emptied that glass by now, he is the one who should have stood up against the murderer. Spectre against spectre, he murmured, finishing his sentence aloud.
101.072 --Sir, said Valentine, I will do everything to live, because there are two beings in the world who love me to death if I died: my grandfather and Maximilian.
101.073 --I will watch over them as I have watched over you.
101.074 -- Well, sir, dispose of me, said Valentine. Then in a low voice: my God! my God! she said, what will happen to me?
101. 075 -- Whatever happens to you, Valentine, do not be frightened; if you suffer, if you lose your sight, your hearing, your sense of touch, do not be afraid; if you wake up without knowing where you are, do not be afraid, even if you find yourself in some sepulchral vault or nailed in some bier when you wake up; suddenly recall your mind, and say to yourself: At this moment, a friend, a father, a man who wants my happiness and that of Maximilian, this man watches over me.
101.076 -- Alas! alas! what a terrible end!
101.077 --Valentine, would you rather denounce your mother-in-law?
101.078 --I would rather die a hundred times! oh, yes, die!
101.079 -- No, you will not die, and whatever happens to you, you promise me, you will not complain, you will hope?
101.080 --I will think of Maximilian.
101.081 --You are my beloved daughter, Valentine; alone I can save you, and I will save you."
101.082 Valentine, at the height of terror, joined her hands (for she felt that the moment had come to ask God for courage) and drew herself up to pray, murmuring words without continuation, and forgetting that her white shoulders had no other veil than her long hair, and that her heart could be seen beating under the fine lace of the nightgown.
101.083 The Count gently laid his hand on the girl's arm, pulled the velvet quilt over her neck, and, with a paternal smile:
101.084 "My daughter," he said, "believe in my devotion, as you believe in the goodness of God and in the love of Maximilian."
101.085 Valentine fixed on him a look full of gratitude, and remained docile as a child under her veils.
101.086 Then the Count drew from his vest pocket the emerald candy dish, lifted its golden lid, and poured into Valentine's right hand a small round pellet the size of a pea.
101.087 Valentine took it with his other hand, and looked at the count attentively: there was on the features of this intrepid protector a reflection of divine majesty and power. It was evident that Valentine was questioning him with his eyes.
101.088 "Yes", answered this one.
101.089 Valentine brought the pastille to his mouth and swallowed it.
101.090 "And now, goodbye, my child," he said, "I will try to sleep because you are saved.
101.091 --Come on," said Valentine, "whatever happens to me, I promise not to be afraid."
101.092 Monte Cristo held his eyes fixed on the girl for a long time, who gradually fell asleep, overcome by the power of the narcotic that the Count had just given her.
101.093 Then he took the glass, emptied it three-quarters of the way down the chimney, so that it might be believed that Valentine had drunk what was lacking, and put it back on the bedside table; then, regaining the door of the library, he disappeared after casting a last glance at Valentine, who was falling asleep with the confidence and candor of an angel lying at the feet of the Lord.
102.000 Valentine.
102. 001 The pilot light continued to burn on the chimney of Valentine, exhausting the last drops of oil which still surfaced on the water; already a more reddish circle coloured the alabaster of the globe, already the brighter flame let escape these last sparkles which seem in the inanimate beings these last convulsions of the agony which one so often compared with those of the poor human creatures; a low and sinister day came to tint with a reflexion of opal the white curtains and the cloths of the girl.
102.002 All the noises of the street were extinguished for this time, and the silence inside was frightening.
102.003 Then the door to Edward's room opened, and a face we have already seen appeared in the mirror opposite the door: it was Mme de Villefort coming in to see the effect of the drink.
102.004 She stopped on the threshold, listened to the flickering of the lamp, the only sound perceptible in this room which one would have thought deserted, then she moved slowly towards the bedside table to see if Valentine's glass was empty.
102.005 It was still a quarter full, as we have said.
102.006 Mme de Villefort took it and went to empty it into the ashes, which she stirred to facilitate the absorption of the liquor, then she carefully rinsed the crystal, wiped it with her own handkerchief, and placed it back on the nightstand.
102.007 Anyone whose gaze could have plunged into the interior of the room would have seen Mme de Villefort's hesitation to fix her eyes on Valentine and approach the bed.
102.008 This gloomy glow, this silence, this terrible poetry of the night, no doubt combined with the dreadful poetry of her conscience: the poisoner was afraid of her work.
102.009 At last she grew bolder, drew aside the curtain, leaned against the bedside, and looked at Valentine.
102.010 The girl was no longer breathing, her half-loosened teeth did not let out a single atom of that breath which indicates life; her whitening lips had ceased to quiver; her eyes, drowned in a violet vapor which seemed to have filtered under the skin, formed a whiter protrusion at the place where the globe swelled the eyelid, and her long black eyelashes scratched a skin that was already as dull as wax.
102.011 Mme. de Villefort contemplated this face with an expression so eloquent in its immobility; she then became bold, and, lifting the blanket, she pressed her hand on the girl's heart.
102.012 He was mute and frozen.
102.013 What beat under his hand was the artery of his fingers: she withdrew her hand with a shudder.
102.014 Valentine's arm hung out of the bed; this arm, in all the part which was attached to the shoulder and extended until the bleeding, seemed molded on that of one of the Graces of Germain Pilon; but the forearm was slightly deformed by a crispness, and the wrist, of such a pure form, leaned, a little stiffened and the fingers spread on the mahogany.
102.015 The birth of the nails was bluish.
102.016 For Mme de Villefort, there was no longer any doubt: everything was finished, the terrible work, the last she had to accomplish, was finally done.
102.017 The poisoner had nothing more to do in that room; she stepped back so carefully that it was visible that she dreaded the crunch of her feet on the carpet, but, while stepping back, she still held the curtain up, absorbing that spectacle of death which carries with it its irresistible attraction, as long as death is not decomposition, but only immobility, as long as it remains the mystery, and is not yet disgust.
102.018 The minutes passed; Mme de Villefort could not let go of the curtain which she held suspended like a shroud over Valentine's head. She paid her tribute to reverie: the reverie of crime must be remorse.
102.019 At that moment, the flickering of the night-light redoubled.
102.020 Mme de Villefort shuddered at the sound and let the curtain fall again.
102.021 At the same instant the night light went out, and the room was plunged into a frightening darkness.
102.022 In the midst of this darkness the clock awoke and struck half past four.
102.023 The poisoner, frightened by these successive concussions, groped her way to the door, and returned home with a sweat of anguish on her forehead.
102.024 The darkness continued for another two hours.
102.025 Then little by little a pale day invaded the apartment, filtering through the slats of the blinds; then little by little again it became large, and came to give color and form to objects and bodies.
102.026 It was at this moment that the coughing of the nurse resounded on the staircase, and that this woman entered Valentine's house, a cup in her hand.
102.027 For a father, for a lover, the first glance would have been decisive, Valentine was dead, for this mercenary, Valentine was only asleep.
102.028 "Well," she said as she approached the bedside table, "she has drunk part of her potion, the glass is two-thirds empty."
102.029 Then she went to the fireplace, relit the fire, settled into her armchair, and, though she was getting out of bed, took advantage of Valentine's sleep to sleep for a few more moments.
102.030 The clock awoke her by striking eight.
102.031 Then, astonished at the obstinate sleep in which the young girl remained, and frightened by the arm hanging out of bed, which the sleeper had not brought to her, she moved towards the bed, and it was only then that she noticed those cold lips and that icy chest.
102.032 She wanted to bring her arm close to her body, but the arm only obeyed with that frightening stiffness that a nurse could not mistake.
102.033 She gave a horrible cry.
102.034 Then, running to the door
102.035 "Help!" she cried, "Help!
102.036 -Help!" answered M. d'Avrigny's voice from the bottom of the stairs.
102.037 It was the hour when the doctor used to come.
102.038 "How, help!" cried Villefort, coming out of his office in a hurry; "Doctor, didn't you hear the cry for help?
102.039 --Yes, yes; let's go up," replied d'Avrigny, "let's go up quickly to Valentine's."
102.040 But before the doctor and the father had entered, the servants who were on the same floor, in the rooms or in the corridors, had entered, and, seeing Valentine pale and motionless on her bed, raised their hands to heaven and staggered as if struck with vertigo.
102.041 "Call Mme de Villefort! Wake Mme de Villefort!" cried the King's Attorney, from the door of the room into which he seemed not to dare enter.
102.042 But the servants, instead of answering, looked at M. d'Avrigny, who had entered, he, who had run to Valentine and was lifting her up in his arms.
102.043 "This one again...," he murmured, letting her fall. O my God, my God, when will you tire?"
102.044 Villefort rushed into the apartment.
102.045 "What are you saying, my God!" he cried, raising both hands to heaven. Doctor!... Doctor!...
102.046 -- "I say that Valentine is dead!" answered d'Avrigny in a solemn and terrible voice.
102.047 M. de Villefort fell as if his legs were broken, and dropped his head on Valentine's bed.
102.048 At the doctor's words, at the father's cries, the terrified servants fled with muffled imprecations; their hurried footsteps were heard on the stairs and in the corridors, then a great movement in the courtyards, and then that was all; the noise died out: from the first to the last, they had deserted the cursed house.
102.049 At this moment Mme. de Villefort, with her arm half wrapped in her morning robe, lifted the tapestry; for a moment she remained on the threshold, seeming to question those present and calling to her aid a few rebellious tears.
102.050 Suddenly she took a step, or rather a leap forward, with her arms outstretched toward the table.
102.051 She had just seen D'Avrigny bend curiously over the table and pick up the glass that she was sure she had emptied during the night.
102.052 The glass was one-third full, just as it had been when she had thrown the contents into the ashes.
102.053 The specter of Valentine standing before the poisoner would have produced less effect on her.
102.054 Indeed, it was the color of the drink that she had poured into Valentine's glass, and that Valentine had drunk; it was the poison that could not deceive M. d'Avrigny's eye, and that M. d'Avrigny was looking at attentively: it was a miracle that God had undoubtedly wrought so that there remained, in spite of the assassin's precautions, a trace, a proof, a denunciation of the crime.
102.055 However, while Mme. de Villefort remained motionless like the statue of the Terror, while de Villefort, with his head hidden in the sheets of the deathbed, saw nothing of what was going on around him, d'Avrigny approached the window to better examine with his eyes the contents of the glass, and to taste a drop taken from the tip of his finger.
102.056 "Ah," he murmured, "it is no longer brucine now; let us see what it is!"
102.057 Then he ran to one of the cupboards in Valentine's room, a cupboard transformed into a pharmacy, and, drawing from its little silver case a bottle of nitric acid, he dropped a few drops into the opal of the liquor, which at once changed into half a glass of ruddy blood.
102.058 "Ah!" said D'Avrigny, with the horror of a judge to whom the truth is revealed, mingled with the joy of a scientist to whom a problem is revealed.
102.059 Mme. de Villefort spun around for a moment; her eyes flashed, then went out; she sought, staggering, the door with her hand, and disappeared.
102.060 A moment later, the distant sound of a body falling to the floor was heard.
102.061 But no one paid any attention. The guard was busy watching the chemical analysis, Villefort was still devastated.
102.062 Only M. d'Avrigny had followed Mme de Villefort with his eyes and noticed her hurried exit.
102.063 He lifted the tapestry of Valentine's room and his gaze, through that of Édouard, was able to plunge into Mme de Villefort's apartment, which he saw lying motionless on the floor.
102.064 "Go and help Mme de Villefort," he said to the guard; "Mme de Villefort is not well.
102.065 --But Miss Valentine? stammered the latter.
102.066 --Miss Valentine no longer needs help, said d'Avrigny, since Miss Valentine is dead.
102.067 --Dead! dead! sighed Villefort in the paroxysm of a pain all the more heart-rending because it was new, unknown, unheard of for this bronze heart.
102.068 --Dead! you say?" cried a third voice; "who said Valentine was dead?"
102.069 The two men turned, and in the doorway saw Morrel standing, pale, distressed, terrible.
102.070 This is what had happened:
102.071 At his usual hour, and through the little door that led to Noirtier's, Morrel had presented himself.
102.072 Against custom, he found the door open, so he didn't need to ring the bell, he entered.
102.073 In the vestibule he waited for a moment, calling for some servant to introduce him to old Noirtier.
102.074 But no one answered; the servants, as we know, had deserted the house.
102.075 Morrel had no particular cause for concern that day: he had Monte Cristo's promise that Valentine would live, and so far the promise had been faithfully kept. Every evening the Count had given him good news, which Noirtier himself confirmed the next day.
102.076 However, this solitude seemed strange to him; he called a second time, a third time, same silence.
102.077 Then he decided to go upstairs.
102.078 Noirtier's door was open like the other doors.
102.079 The first thing he saw was the old man in his chair, in his usual place; his dilated eyes seemed to express an inner fear that was confirmed by the strange pallor of his features.
102.080 "How are you, sir?" asked the young man, not without a certain tightness of heart.
102.081 -Good!" said the old man with a twinkle in his eye, "good!
102.082 But his countenance seemed to grow in concern.
102.083 "You are preoccupied," continued Morrel, "you need something. Do you want me to call one of your people?
102.084 --Yes," said Noirtier.
102.085 Morrel hung on to the bell; but no matter how hard he pulled, no one came.
102.086 He turned back to Noirtier; the pallor and anguish were growing on the old man's face.
102.087 "My God! my God!" said Morrel, "why don't they come? Is there anyone sick in the house?"
102.088 Noirtier's eyes seemed ready to burst from their sockets.
102.089 "But what is the matter with you," continued Morrel, "you frighten me. Valentine! Valentine!
102.090 -- "Yes!" said Noirtier.
102.091 Maximilian opened his mouth to speak, but his tongue could not articulate any sound: he staggered and held on to the woodwork.
102.092 Then he stretched out his hand toward the door.
102.093 "Yes, yes, yes!" continued the old man.
102.094 Maximilian dashed up the small staircase, which he crossed in two leaps, as Noirtier seemed to be shouting at him with his eyes:
102.095 "Faster! Faster!"
102.096 A minute sufficed for the young man to cross several rooms, solitary like the rest of the house, and to reach Valentine's.
102.097 He did not need to push the door open, it was wide open.
102.098 A sob was the first sound he heard. He saw, as if through a cloud, a black figure kneeling and lost in a confused mass of white draperies. Fear, frightful fear, nailed him to the threshold.
102.099 It was then that he heard a voice saying, "Valentine is dead," and a second voice that, like an echo, answered:
102.100 "Dead! Dead!"
103.000 Maximilien.
103.001 Villefort got up almost ashamed of having been surprised in the attack of this pain.
103.002 The terrible state he had been in for twenty-five years had come to make him more or less than a man.
103.003 His gaze, for a moment lost, was fixed on Morrel.
103.004 "Who are you, sir," he said, "who has forgotten that one does not enter a house inhabited by death like that?
103.005 "Get out, sir! Get out!
103.006 But Morrel remained motionless, he could not take his eyes off the frightening spectacle of that bed in disorder and the pale figure lying on it.
103.007 "Get out, do you hear!" cried Villefort, while D'Avrigny went forward on his side to bring Morrel out.
103.008 The latter looked with a bewildered air at this corpse, at these two men, at the whole room, seemed to hesitate for a moment, opened his mouth; then finally, not finding a word to answer, in spite of the innumerable swarms of fatal ideas which invaded his brain, he turned back, thrusting his hands into his hair; so that Villefort and d'Avrigny, for a moment distracted from their preoccupations, exchanged, after having followed him with their eyes, a look which meant:
103.009 "He is mad!"
103.010 But before five minutes had elapsed, the staircase was heard to groan under a considerable weight, and Morrel was seen, with superhuman strength, lifting Noirtier's chair between his arms, bringing the old man to the second floor of the house.
103.011 Arrived at the top of the staircase, Morrel put the armchair on the ground and rolled it quickly to Valentine's room.
103.012 All this maneuver was carried out with a force multiplied tenfold by the frenetic exaltation of the young man.
103.013 But one thing was frightening especially, it was the figure of Noirtier advancing towards the bed of Valentine, pushed by Morrel, the figure of Noirtier in whom the intelligence deployed all its resources, whose eyes joined together all their power to replace the other faculties.
103.014 Also this pale face, with its fiery look, was for Villefort a frightening apparition.
103.015 Whenever he had come into contact with his father, something terrible had always happened.
103.016 "See what they have done with it!" cried Morrel, one hand still resting on the back of the armchair which he had just pushed to the bed, and the other stretched out towards Valentine; "see, father, see!
103.017 Villefort drew back a step and looked with astonishment at this young man who was almost unknown to him, and who called Noirtier his father.
103.018 At this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed to pass into his eyes, which became injected with blood; then the veins of his neck swelled, a bluish tint like that which invades the skin of an epileptic, covered his neck, his cheeks and his temples; all that was missing from this interior explosion of the whole being was a cry.
103.019 This cry came out of every pore, so to speak, frightening in its silence, tearing in its silence.
103.020 D'Avrigny rushed towards the old man and made him breathe a violent revulsive.
103.021 "Sir!" then cried Morrel, seizing the inert hand of the paralytic, "they ask me what I am, and what right I have to be here. O you who know it, say it, you! Say it!"
103.022 And the young man's voice died out in sobs.
103.023 As for the old man, his panting breath shook his chest. It seemed as if he was in the throes of agony.
103.024 Finally, tears came from Noirtier's eyes, happier than the young man who was sobbing without crying. His head could not bend, his eyes closed.
103.025 "Say," continued Morrel in a strangled voice, "say that I was her fiancé!
103.026 "Say that she was my noble friend, my only love on earth!
103.027 "Say, say, say, that this corpse belongs to me!"
103.028 And the young man, giving the terrible spectacle of a great strength breaking, fell heavily on his knees before that bed which his clenched fingers embraced with violence.
103.029 This pain was so poignant that d'Avrigny turned away to hide his emotion, and Villefort, without asking for any further explanation, attracted by that magnetism which impels us towards those who have loved those we mourn, held out his hand to the young man.
103.030 But Morrel saw nothing; he had seized Valentine's cold hand, and, unable to cry, he bit the sheets, roaring.
103.031 For some time, one heard in this room only the conflict of sobs, imprecations and prayer. And yet one sound dominated all these, it was the hoarse and heart-rending aspiration which seemed, with each intake of air, to break one of the springs of life in Noirtier's chest.
103.032 Finally, Villefort, the most masterful of them all, after having, so to speak, yielded his place to Maximilien for some time, Villefort spoke up.
103.033 "Sir," he said to Maximilien, "you loved Valentine, you say: you were her fiancé; I was unaware of this love, I was unaware of this engagement; and yet, I, her father, forgive you, because, I see, your sorrow is great, real and true.
103.034 "Besides, in me also the pain is too great for there to remain in my heart place for anger."
103.035 "But, you see, the angel you hoped for has left the earth: she has no more use for the adoration of men, she who at this hour worships the Lord; bid farewell, then, sir, to the sad corpse she has forgotten among us; take her hand one last time, which you have been waiting for, and part from her forever: Valentine now needs only the priest who must bless her.
103.036 -- "You are mistaken, sir," cried Morrel, rising on one knee, his heart pierced by a pain more acute than any he had yet felt; "you are mistaken: Valentine, dead as she is, needs not only a priest, but also an avenger.
103.037 "Monsieur de Villefort, send for the priest; I will be the avenger.
103.038 --What do you mean, sir?" murmured Villefort, trembling at this new inspiration from Morrel's delirium.
103.039 -- I mean," continued Morrel, "that there are two men in you, sir. The father has cried enough; let the king's prosecutor begin his office."
103.040 Noirtier's eyes sparkled; d'Avrigny drew nearer.
103.041 "Sir," continued the young man, gathering with his eyes all the feelings that were revealed on the faces of those present, "I know what I am saying, and you all know as well as I do what I am going to say.
103.042 "Valentine has been murdered!"
103.043 Villefort lowered his head; d'Avrigny took another step forward; Noirtier nodded.
103.044 "Now, sir," continued Morrel, "in the times in which we live, a creature, not even a young one, not even a beautiful one, not even an adorable one, as Valentine was, a creature does not disappear violently from the world without being asked to account for her disappearance.
103.045 "Come, monsieur le procureur du roi," added Morrel with increasing vehemence, "no pity! I denounce the crime to you, seek the assassin!"
103.046 And his implacable eye questioned Villefort, who on his side solicited with his gaze sometimes Noirtier, sometimes d'Avrigny.
103.047 But instead of finding help in his father and in the doctor, Villefort met in them only a look as inflexible as that of Morrel.
103.048 "Yes!" said the old man.
103.049 --Certes!" said d'Avrigny.
103.050 --Monsieur, replied Villefort, trying to fight against this triple will and against his own emotion, monsieur, you are mistaken, there are no crimes committed in my house; fate strikes me, God tests me; it is horrible to think; but one does not murder anyone!"
103.051 Noirtier's eyes blazed, d'Avrigny opened his mouth to speak.
103.052 Morrel stretched out his arm, commanding silence.
103.053 "And I tell you that they are killing here!" cried Morrel, whose voice dropped without losing its terrible vibration.
103.054 "I tell you that this is the fourth victim struck down in the last four months.
103.055 "I tell you that they had already tried once, four days ago, to poison Valentine, and that they had failed thanks to the precautions that M. Noirtier had taken!
103.056 "I tell you that they doubled the dose or changed the nature of the poison, and that this time they succeeded!
103.057 "I tell you that you know all this as well as I do, after all, since this gentleman warned you about it, both as a doctor and as a friend.
103.058 -- "Oh, you are delirious!" said Villefort, vainly trying to struggle in the circle in which he felt himself caught.
103.059 --I am delirious!" cried Morrel; "well, I appeal to M. d'Avrigny himself.
103.060 "Ask him, sir, if he still remembers the words he uttered in your garden, in the garden of this hotel, on the very evening of Mme. de Saint-Méran's death, when the two of you, you and he, believing yourselves to be alone, were discussing this tragic death, in which this fatality of which you speak, and God, whom you accuse unjustly, can only be counted for one thing; that is, for having created Valentine's assassin!"
103.061 Villefort and d'Avrigny looked at each other.
103.062 "Yes, yes, remember," said Morrel, "for these words, which you thought were delivered to silence and solitude, have fallen on my ear. Certainly, from that evening, seeing M. de Villefort's guilty complaisance for his own, I should have discovered everything to the authorities; I would not be an accomplice as I am at this moment in your death, Valentine! my beloved Valentine! but the accomplice will become the avenger; this fourth murder is flagrant and visible to the eyes of all, and if your father abandons you, Valentine, I am the one, I swear it to you, who will pursue the assassin."
103.063 And this time, as if nature had at last taken pity on this vigorous organization ready to break by its own strength, Morrel's last words died in his throat; his chest burst into sobs, the tears, so long rebellious, burst from his eyes, he collapsed upon himself, and fell back on his knees weeping beside Valentine's bed.
103.064 Then it was d'Avrigny's turn.
103.065 "And I, too," he said in a loud voice, "I, too, join with M. Morrel in asking for justice for the crime; for my heart rises at the thought that my cowardly complacency has encouraged the assassin!
103.066 -- O my God! my God!" murmured Villefort in awe.
103.067 Morrel raised his head, reading in the old man's eyes, which flashed a supernatural flame:
103.068 "Here," he said, "here, M. Noirtier wants to speak.
103.069 --Yes," said Noirtier with an expression that was all the more terrible because all the faculties of this poor impotent old man were concentrated in his eyes.
103.070 --You know the assassin? said Morrel.
103.071 -- Yes, replied Noirtier.
103.072 --And you are going to guide us? Let us listen! Mr. d'Avrigny, let us listen!"
103.073 Noirtier addressed to the unhappy Morrel a melancholy smile, one of those sweet smiles of the eyes which had so often made Valentine happy, and fixed his attention.
103.074 Then, having riveted his interlocutor's eyes to his own, so to speak, he turned them away toward the door.
103.075 "Do you want me to go out, sir?" cried Morrel painfully.
103.076 --Yes," said Noirtier.
103.077 --Alas! alas! sir; but have mercy on me!"
103.078 The old man's eyes remained mercilessly fixed on the door.
103.079 "Could I come back, at least?" asked Morrel.
103.080 --Yes.
103.081 --Shall I go out alone?
103.082 --No.
103.083 --Who should I take with me? Mr. Procurator to the King?
103.084 --No.
103.085 --The doctor?
103.086 --Yes.
103.087 --Do you want to be alone with Monsieur de Villefort?
103.088 --Yes.
103.089 --But could he understand you?
103.090 --Yes.
103.091 --Oh!" said Villefort, almost joyful at the fact that the investigation was going to be conducted face to face, "oh, be assured, I understand my father very well.
103.092 And while saying this with that expression of joy which we have pointed out, the king's prosecutor's teeth clashed violently.
103.093 D'Avrigny took Morrel's arm and led the young man into the next room.
103.094 There was then a silence in the whole house that was deeper than death.
103.095 At last, after a quarter of an hour, a faltering step was heard, and Villefort appeared on the threshold of the salon where d'Avrigny and Morrel were standing, one absorbed and the other suffocating.
103.096 "Come," he said.
103.097 And he led them back to Noirtier's armchair.
103.098 Morrel, then, looked attentively at Villefort.
103.099 The figure of the king's prosecutor was livid; large rust-colored spots crisscrossed his forehead; between his fingers, a feather twisted in a thousand ways screamed as it tore itself to shreds.
103.100 "Gentlemen," he said in a strangled voice to d'Avrigny and Morrel, "gentlemen, your word of honor that the horrible secret will remain buried between us!"
103.101 The two men made a movement.
103.102 "I beseech you!..." continued Villefort.
103.103 --But, said Morrel, the culprit!... the murderer!... the assassin!...
103.104 -Sit down, sir, justice will be done, said Villefort. I am not a man of the world, and I am not a man of the world, and I am not a man of the world, and I am not a man of the world, and I am not a man of the world.
103.105 "Isn't that so, Father?
103.106 --Yes," Noirtier said resolutely.
103.107 Morrel let out a movement of horror and incredulity.
103.108 "Oh!" cried Villefort, stopping Maximilien by the arm, "oh, sir, if my father, the inflexible man you know, makes this request of you, it is because he knows that Valentine will be terribly avenged.
103.109 "Isn't that so, Father?"
103.110 The old man nodded.
103.111 Villefort continued.
103.112 "He knows me, and it is to him that I have given my word. Three days, I ask you, is less than justice would ask of you, and in three days the vengeance I will have taken for the murder of my child will make the most indifferent of men shudder to their very core.
103.113 "Is it not so, Father?"
103.114 And as he said these words, he gritted his teeth and shook the old man's numb hand.
103.115 "Will everything that is promised be kept, Monsieur Noirtier?" asked Morrel, while d'Avrigny questioned with his eyes.
103.116 --Yes," said Noirtier, with a look of sinister joy.
103.117 --Swear, then, gentlemen," said Villefort, joining the hands of d'Avrigny and Morrel, "swear that you will have pity on the honor of my house, and that you will leave it to me to avenge it?"
103.118 D'Avrigny turned away and murmured a feeble yes, but Morrel snatched his hand from the magistrate, rushed to the bed, impressed his lips on Valentine's icy lips, and fled with the long moan of a soul engulfed in despair.
103.119 We have said that all the servants had disappeared.
103.120 M. de Villefort was therefore forced to ask d'Avrigny to take charge of the many and delicate steps that death in our great cities entails, and especially death accompanied by such suspicious circumstances.
103.121 As for Noirtier, it was a terrible thing to see that pain without movement, that despair without gestures, that tears without voice.
103.122 Villefort went back to his office; d'Avrigny went to find the doctor of the town hall, who performs the duties of death inspector, and who is rather energetically called the doctor of the dead.
103.123 Noirtier did not want to leave his granddaughter.
103.124 After half an hour, M. d'Avrigny returned with his colleague; the doors to the street had been closed, and as the concierge had disappeared with the other servants, it was Villefort himself who went to open them.
103.125 But he stopped on the landing; he no longer had the courage to enter the death chamber.
103.126 So the two doctors entered Valentine's room alone.
103.127 Noirtier stood by the bed, pale like the dead woman, motionless and mute like her.
103.128 The doctor of the dead approached with the indifference of the man who spends half his life with corpses, lifted the sheet that covered the girl, and only half-opened his lips.
103.129 "Oh!" said d'Avrigny, sighing, "poor girl, she is quite dead, come on.
103.130 --Yes," replied the doctor laconically, letting the sheet that covered Valentine's face fall back down.
103.131 Noirtier let out a muffled moan.
103.132 D'Avrigny turned around, the old man's eyes sparkled. The good doctor understood that Noirtier was asking for the sight of his child, he brought him closer to the bed, and while the doctor of the dead soaked the fingers that had touched the lips of the deceased in chlorinated water, he discovered that calm and pale face that seemed to be that of a sleeping angel.
103.133 A tear that reappeared in the corner of Noirtier's eye was the thanks that the good doctor received.
103.134 The doctor of the dead drew up his report on the corner of a table, in Valentine's room, and, this supreme formality accomplished, left, led by the doctor.
103.135 Villefort heard them coming downstairs and went back to the door of his office.
103.136 In a few words he thanked the doctor, and, turning back to d'Avrigny
103.137 "And now!" he said, "the priest?
103.138 --Do you have a clergyman whom you wish to charge more particularly with praying near Valentine?" asked d'Avrigny.
103.139 -- No, said Villefort, go to the nearest one.
103.140 -The nearest, said the doctor, is a good Italian abbot who has come to live in the house next to yours. Would you like me to warn him in passing?
103.141 --D'Avrigny, said Villefort, please accompany the gentleman.
103.142 "Here is the key so that you can enter and leave at will.
103.143 "You will bring the priest back, and you will take care to install him in my poor child's room.
103.144 --Do you wish to speak to him, my friend?
103.145 -- I wish to be alone. You will excuse me, won't you? A priest must understand all sorrows, even paternal sorrow."
103.146 And M. de Villefort, giving a passkey to d'Avrigny, saluted the foreign doctor one last time and returned to his cabinet, where he began to work.
103.147 For some organizations, work is the remedy for all pains.
103.148 As they went down the street, they saw a man dressed in a cassock standing in the next doorway.
103.149 "This is the one I was telling you about," said the doctor of the dead to d'Avrigny.
103.150 D'Avrigny approached the clergyman.
103.151 "Sir," he said to him, "would you be willing to do a great service to an unfortunate father who has just lost his daughter, to Mr. Villefort, the king's attorney?
103.152 - "Ah, sir," replied the priest with a very pronounced Italian accent, "yes, I know, death is in his house.
103.153 --So I don't have to tell you what kind of service he dares to expect from you.
103.154 -- I was going to offer myself, sir," said the priest; "it is our mission to go ahead of our duties.
103.155 --She is a young girl.
103.156 --Yes, I know that, I learned it from the servants I saw fleeing the house. I knew that her name was Valentine; and I have already prayed for her.
103.157 --Thank you, thank you, sir, said d'Avrigny, and since you have already begun to exercise your holy ministry, deign to continue it. Come and sit by the dead woman, and a whole family in mourning will be very grateful to you.
103.158 -- "I am going, sir," replied the abbot, "and I dare say that no prayers will ever be more ardent than mine."
103.159 D'Avrigny took the abbot by the hand, and without meeting Villefort, who was locked in his study, he led him to Valentine's room, which the burial men were to take over only the next night.
103.160 As he entered the room, Noirtier's gaze met that of the abbé, and no doubt he thought he read something peculiar in it, for he never left it.
103.161 D'Avrigny recommended to the priest not only the dead woman but the living man, and the priest promised d'Avrigny to give his prayers to Valentine and his care to Noirtier.
103.162 The abbot solemnly undertook to do so, and, no doubt in order not to be disturbed in his prayers, and so that Noirtier might not be disturbed in his grief, he went, as soon as M. d'Avrigny had left the room, to close not only the bolts of the door by which the doctor had just gone out, but also the bolts of the one which led to Mme de Villefort's.
104.000 The Danglars signature.
104.001 The next day dawned sad and cloudy.
104.002 During the night the burial men had performed their funeral service, and sewed the body on the bed in the shroud which mournfully drapes the dead, lending them, whatever one may say of equality in the face of death, a last token of the luxury they loved during their life.
104.003 This shroud was nothing other than a piece of beautiful batiste that the girl had bought a fortnight before.
104.004 In the evening, men called for the purpose had carried Noirtier from Valentine's room into his, and, against all expectations, the old man had made no difficulty in moving away from the body of his child.
104.005 Abbé Busoni had kept watch until daylight, and at daylight he had retired to his house without calling anyone.
104.006 About eight o'clock in the morning, d'Avrigny had returned; he had met Villefort who was passing Noirtier's house, and he had accompanied him to find out how the old man had spent the night.
104.007 They found him in the big armchair that served as his bed, resting in a gentle, almost smiling sleep.
104.008 Both of them stood astonished on the threshold.
104.009 "See," said D'Avrigny to Villefort, who was looking at his sleeping father; "see, nature knows how to calm the most vivid pains; certainly, it will not be said that M. Noirtier did not love his granddaughter; he is sleeping, however.
104.010 --Yes, and you are right," replied Villefort with surprise; "he sleeps, and that is very strange, for the least annoyance keeps him awake for whole nights.
104.011 --Pain has overcome him," replied D'Avrigny.
104.012 And both of them returned thoughtfully to the office of the king's prosecutor.
104.013 "Here, I have not slept," said Villefort, showing d'Avrigny his untouched bed; "pain does not overwhelm me, I have not gone to bed for two nights; but, in return, see my desk; have I written, my God! during these two days and these two nights!... have I searched this file, have I annotated this indictment of the murderer Benedetto!... O work, work! my passion, my joy, my rage, it is for you to overcome all my pains!"
104.014 And he shook d'Avrigny's hand convulsively.
104.015 "Do you need me?" asked the doctor.
104.016 -- No, said Villefort; only come back at eleven o'clock, I pray you; it is at noon that the departure takes place... My God! My poor child! My poor child!
104.017 And the king's prosecutor, becoming a man again, raised his eyes to heaven and sighed.
104.018 "Will you stand in the reception room then?
104.019 -- No, I have a cousin who will do that sad honor. I will work, doctor; when I work, everything disappears."
104.020 Indeed, the doctor was not even at the door when the king's prosecutor had already gone back to work.
104.021 On the stoop, d'Avrigny met the relative of whom Villefort had spoken to him, an insignificant character in this story as in the family, one of those beings destined at birth to play the role of utility in the world.
104.022 He was punctual, dressed in black, had a crêpe on his arm, and had gone to his cousin's house with a figure he had made for himself, which he intended to keep as long as necessary, and then leave.
104.023 At eleven o'clock the funeral carriages rolled onto the courtyard pavement, and the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honoré was filled with the murmurs of the crowd, equally eager for the joys or the mourning of the rich, and which runs to a pompous funeral with the same haste as to a duchess's wedding.
104.024 Little by little the funeral parlor filled up, and some of our old acquaintances arrived first, that is, Debray, Château-Renaud, Beauchamp, and then all the illustrations of the public prosecutor's office, of literature, and of the army; for M. de Villefort occupied one of the first ranks in the Parisian world, not so much by his social position as by his personal merit.
104.025 The cousin stood at the door and let everyone in, and it was a great relief to the indifferent, it must be said, to see there an indifferent figure who did not demand of the guests a lying countenance or false tears, as a father, a brother, or a fiancé would have done.
104.026 Those who knew each other called to each other with their eyes and met in groups.
104.027 One of these groups consisted of Debray, Château-Renaud and Beauchamp.
104.028 "Poor young girl!" said Debray, paying, as everyone else did in spite of themselves, a tribute to this painful event; "poor young girl! so rich, so beautiful! Would you have thought that, Château-Renaud, when we came, how long ago?... three weeks or a month at most, to sign this contract which was not signed?
104.029 --My goodness, no, said Château-Renaud.
104.030 -Did you know her?
104.031 -- I had spoken with her once or twice at Madame de Morcerf's ball, and she seemed charming to me, though a little melancholy in spirit. Where is the mother-in-law? do you know?
104.032 -- She went to spend the day with the wife of this worthy gentleman who is receiving us.
104.033 --What is this?
104.034 --Who?
104.035 --The gentleman who is receiving us. A deputy?
104.036 -- No, said Beauchamp; I am condemned to see our honorees every day, and his face is unknown to me.
104.037 -Did you mention this death in your newspaper?
104.038 -The article is not mine, but it has been mentioned; I doubt if it will even please M. de Villefort. It is said, I believe, that if four successive deaths had taken place somewhere other than in the house of the King's prosecutor, the King's prosecutor would certainly have been more moved by it.
104.039 --Again, said Château-Renaud, Doctor d'Avrigny, who is my mother's doctor, claims that he is very desperate.
104.040 --But who are you looking for, Debray?
104.041 -- I am looking for M. de Monte Cristo," replied the young man.
104.042 -- I met him on the boulevard on my way here. I think he was on his way to his banker's," said Beauchamp.
104.043 --To his banker's? His banker, is it not Danglars?" asked Château-Renaud of Debray.
104.044 --I think so, replied the intimate secretary with a slight disturbance; but M. de Monte Cristo is not the only one missing here. I do not see Morrel.
104.045 --Morrel! did he know them? asked Château-Renaud.
104.046 --I think he had been introduced to Mme de Villefort only.
104.047 --No matter, he should have come, said Debray; what will he talk about this evening? This funeral is the news of the day; but, hush, let us be silent, here is M. the Minister of Justice and Cults, he will think himself obliged to make his little _speech_ to the weeping cousin."
104.048 And the three young men moved closer to the door to hear the little _speech_ of M. le ministre de la Justice et des Cultes.
104.049 Beauchamp had spoken the truth; on his way to the mortuary invitation he had met Monte Cristo, who, for his part, was making his way to Danglars' hotel in the Rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin.
104.050 The banker had, from his window, seen the Count's carriage entering the courtyard, and he had come to meet him with a saddened but affable face.
104.051 "Well, Count," he said, extending his hand to Monte Cristo, "you have come to offer me your compliments of condolence. In truth, misfortune is in my house; so much so that, when I saw you, I wondered myself whether I had not wished misfortune on these poor Morcerfs, which would have justified the proverb: He who wishes ill, ill befalls him. Well, on my word, no, I did not wish any harm on Morcerf; he was perhaps a little proud for a man starting from nothing, like me, owing everything to himself, like me, but everyone has his defects. Ah, hold on, Count, the people of our generation... But, sorry, you are not of our generation, you are a young man... The people of our generation are not happy this year: witness our puritanical king's prosecutor, witness Villefort, who has just lost his daughter again. Thus, recapitulate: Villefort, as we said, losing his whole family in a strange way; Morcerf disgraced and killed; me, covered with ridicule by the villainy of this Benedetto, and then...
104.052 --And then, what?" asked the Count.
104.053 -- Alas! you do not know?
104.054 -- Some new misfortune?
104.055 --My daughter...
104.056 --Miss Danglars?
104.057 --Eugénie is leaving us.
104.058 --Oh, my God! What are you saying to me!
104.059 --The truth, my dear Count. My God! How happy you are to have neither wife nor children!
104.060 --You think so?
104.061 --Ah, my God!
104.062 --And you say that Miss Eugenie...
104.063 --She could not bear the affront that this wretch had done to us, and asked me for permission to travel.
104.064 --And she left?
104.065 --The other night.
104.066 --With Mrs. Danglars?
104.067 -- No, with a relative... But we are not losing her any less, dear Eugenie; for I doubt whether, with the character I know her to be, she will ever consent to return to France!
104.068 -- What do you want, my dear baron," said Monte Cristo, "family sorrows, sorrows which would be crushing for a poor devil whose child would be his entire fortune, but bearable for a millionaire. Philosophers may well say, but practical men will always give them a denial on this point: money consoles many things; and you, you must be consoled more quickly than anyone else, if you admit the virtue of this sovereign balm: you, the king of finance, the point of intersection of all powers."
104.069 Danglars glanced obliquely at the count, to see whether he was jeering or speaking seriously.
104.070 "Yes," he said, "the fact is that if fortune consoles, I must be consoled: I am rich.
104.071 -So rich, my dear baron, that your fortune resembles the Pyramids; if one wanted to demolish them, one would not dare; if one dared, one could not."
104.072 Danglars smiled at this confident bonhomie of the count.
104.073 "That reminds me," he said, "that when you came in, I was making five small vouchers; I had already signed two of them; will you allow me to make the other three?
104.074 --Do, my dear baron, do."
104.075 There was a moment's silence, during which the banker's pen was heard to cry out, while Monte Cristo looked at the gilded moldings on the ceiling.
104.076 "Bonds from Spain," said Monte Cristo, "bonds from Haiti, bonds from Naples?
104.077 -- No," said Danglars, laughing his smug laugh, "bearer bonds, Bank of France bonds. I am not sure that I have the right to do so, but I am not sure that I have the right to do so, and I am not sure that I have the right to do so, and I am not sure that I have the right to do so.
104.078 Monte Cristo took in his hand, as if to weigh them, the five rags of paper which Danglars proudly presented to him, and read:
104.079 "Please M. le Regent de la Banque to have paid to my order, and out of the funds deposited by me, the sum of one million, value in account.
104.080 "BARON DANGLARS."
104.081 -- "One, two, three, four, five," said Monte Cristo; "five millions! pest! how you go, Lord Croesus!
104.082 -- That is how I do business, said Danglars.
104.083 -- It is marvelous, if above all, as I have no doubt, this sum is paid in cash.
104.084 -- It will be, said Danglars.
104.085 -- It is beautiful to have such a credit; in truth, it is only in France that one sees such things: five rags of paper worth five million; and one must see it to believe it.
104.086 -- Do you doubt it?
104.087 -- No.
104.088 --You say that with an accent... Here, give yourself the pleasure: take my clerk to the bank, and you will see him come out with treasury bonds for the same sum.
I am not sure that I will be able to do this, but I am sure that I will be able to do it myself, and I am sure that I will be able to do it myself. My credit with you was six million, I took nine hundred thousand francs, it is five million one hundred thousand francs that you still owe me. I take your five rags of paper that I consider to be good just by the sight of your signature, and here is a general receipt for six million that regularizes our account. I had prepared it in advance, because I must tell you that I need money a lot today."
104.090 And with one hand Monte Cristo put the five bills in his pocket, while with the other he handed his receipt to the banker.
104.091 Lightning falling at Danglars' feet would not have crushed him with greater terror.
104.092 "What!" he stammered, "what! But, pardon me, pardon me, it is money I owe to the hospices, a deposit, and I had promised to pay it this morning.
104.093 - "Ah," said Monte Cristo, "that is different. It was out of curiosity that I had taken these, in order to be able to tell the world that, without any notice, without asking me for five minutes' delay, the house of Danglars had paid me five million in cash! it would have been remarkable! But here are your securities; I repeat, give me more."
104.094 And he held out the five effects to Danglars, who, livid, at first extended his hand, as the vulture extends its claw through the bars of its cage to hold back the flesh that is being taken from it.
104.095 Suddenly he changed his mind, made a violent effort and restrained himself.
104.096 Then we saw him smile, gradually rounding the features of his upset face.
104.097 "By the way," he said, "your receipt is money.
104.098 --Oh, my God, yes! And if you were in Rome, on my receipt, the Thomson and French house would have no more difficulty in paying you than you have made yourself.
104.099 --Pardon, sir count, pardon.
104.100 -- May I keep this money?
104.101 --Yes," said Danglars, wiping away the sweat that beaded at the roots of his hair, "keep, keep."
104.102 Monte Cristo put the five bills back into his pocket with that untranslatable movement of physiognomy which means:
104.103 "Lady! reflect; if you repent, there is still time.
104.104 -- No, said Danglars, no; decidedly, keep my signatures. But, you know, nothing is as formal as a man of money; I intended this money for the hospices and I would have thought I was robbing them by not giving them precisely this one, as if one ecu were not worth another. Excuse!"
104.105 And he began to laugh loudly, but from the nerves.
104.106 "I excuse," replied Monte Cristo graciously, "and I pocket."
104.107 And he placed the vouchers in his wallet.
104.108 "But," said Danglars, "we have a sum of one hundred thousand francs?
104.109 --Oh! trifle, said Monte Cristo. The agio must amount to about that sum; keep it, and we shall be even.
104.110 --Count, said Danglars, are you speaking seriously?
104.111 --I never laugh with bankers," replied Monte Cristo with a seriousness that bordered on impertinence.
104.112 And he moved toward the door, just as the valet announced:
104.113 "M. de Boville, Receiver General of the Hospices.
104.114 --My goodness, said Monte Cristo, it seems that I have arrived in time to enjoy your signatures, they are disputed."
104.115 Danglars paled a second time, and hastened to take leave of the count.
104.116 The Count of Monte Cristo exchanged a ceremonious greeting with M. de Boville, who was standing in the waiting-room, and who, M. de Monte Cristo having passed, was immediately ushered into M. Danglars' cabinet.
104.117 One could have seen the Count's serious face light up with a fleeting smile at the appearance of the wallet held in the hand by the receiver of the hospices.
104.118 At the door, he found his car and was driven to the Bank.
104.119 Meanwhile, Danglars, suppressing all emotion, came to meet the Receiver General.
104.120 It goes without saying that the smile and graciousness were stereotyped on his lips.
104.121 "Good morning," he said, "my dear creditor, for I would wager that it is the creditor who is coming to me.
104.122 -- "You have guessed right, Monsieur le Baron," said M. de Boville, "the hospices present themselves to you in my person; the widows and orphans come by my hands to ask you for an alms of five millions.
104.123 --And they say that the orphans are to be pitied!" said Danglars, prolonging the joke; "poor children!
104.124 -Here I am, then, in their name, said M. de Boville. You must have received my letter yesterday?
104.125 --Yes.
104.126 -Here I am with my receipt.
104.127 - "My dear Monsieur de Boville," said Danglars, "your widows and orphans will have the goodness to wait twenty-four hours, since M. de Monte Cristo, whom you have just seen leave here... You have seen him, haven't you?
104.128 --Yes; well?
104.129 -- Well, M. de Monte Cristo was carrying their five million!
104.130 --How did that happen?
104.131 --The Count had an unlimited credit on me, opened by the house of Thomson and French, of Rome. He came to ask me for the sum of five million in one fell swoop; I gave him a voucher for the Bank: that's where my funds are deposited; and you understand, I would fear, if I took ten million out of the hands of Mr. Regent on the same day, that it would seem very strange to him.
104.132 "In two days," added Danglars, smiling, "I do not say.
104.133 - "Let's go, then!" exclaimed M. de Boville in a tone of complete incredulity; "five millions to this gentleman who was going out just now, and who greeted me on his way out as if I knew him?
104.134 --Perhaps he knows you without you knowing him. Mr. de Monte Cristo knows everyone.
104.135 --Five million!
104.136 --There's his receipt. Do as St. Thomas did: see and touch."
104.137 M. de Boville took the paper presented to him by Danglars, and read:
104.138 "Received from M. le baron Danglars the sum of five million one hundred thousand francs, of which he will reimburse himself at will on the house of Thomson and French, of Rome."
104.139 "It is my faith true!" said the latter.
104.140 --Do you know the house of Thomson and French?
104.141 --Yes," said M. de Boville, "I once did a deal of two hundred thousand francs with them; but I have not heard of them since.
104.142 --This is one of the best houses in Europe, said Danglars, casually throwing back on his desk the receipt which he had just taken from M. de Boville's hands.
104.143 --And he had five millions, just like that, on you alone? I have to tell you that I am not a man of the cloth, but I am a man of the cloth.
104.144 --My goodness! I don't know what it is, but he had three unlimited credits: one on me, one on Rothschild, one on Laffitte, and," added Danglars carelessly, "as you see, he gave me preference by leaving me a hundred thousand francs for the agio.
104.145 M. de Boville gave every sign of the greatest admiration.
104.146 "I shall have to go and visit him," he said, "and get some pious foundation for us.
104.147 --Oh! it's as if you had her; her alms alone amount to more than twenty thousand francs a month.
104.148 --That is magnificent; besides, I will quote to her the example of Madame de Morcerf and her son.
104.149 --What example?
104.150 --They gave their entire fortune to the hospices.
104.151 --What fortune?
104.152 --Their fortune, that of General de Morcerf, of the deceased.
104.153 --And for what purpose?
104.154 -- About not wanting a property so miserably acquired.
104.155 --What will they live on?
104.156 --The mother is retiring to the provinces and the son is joining the army.
104.157 - "Well, well," said Danglars, "here are some scruples!
104.158 --I had the deed of gift registered yesterday.
104.159 -- And how much did they own?
104.160 -- Oh, not much: twelve or thirteen hundred thousand francs. But let's get back to our millions.
104.161 -- "Gladly," said Danglars, as naturally as possible; "are you in a hurry for this money?
104.162 --But yes; the audit of our coffers is tomorrow.
104.163 -Tomorrow! Why didn't you say that right away? But this is a century, tomorrow! What time is this audit?
104.164 -- At two o'clock.
104.165 --Send it at noon, said Danglars with his smile.
104.166 M. de Boville did not answer much; he nodded and shook his wallet.
104.167 --Eh! but I'm thinking about it, said Danglars, do better.
104.168 --What do you want me to do?
104.169 -- The receipt from M. de Monte Cristo is worth money; pass this receipt to Rothschild or Laffitte; they will take it from you at once.
104.170 --What is repayable on Rome?
104.171 --Certainly; it will only cost you a discount of five or six thousand francs.
104.172 The receiver jumped back.
104.173 "Well, no, I'd rather wait until tomorrow. How you go!
104.174 -- "I thought for a moment, forgive me," said Danglars with supreme impudence, "I thought you had a small deficit to make up.
104.175 --Ah!" said the collector.
104.176 --Listen, that has been seen, and in this case one makes a sacrifice.
104.177 --Thank God! no, said M. de Boville.
104.178 --Then I'll see you tomorrow; but without fail?
104.179 --Ah, but you are laughing! Send at noon, and the Bank will be informed.
104.180 -- I'll come myself.
104.181 --Better still, since it will give me the pleasure of seeing you."
104.182 They shook hands.
104.183 "By the way," said M. de Boville, "aren't you going to the funeral of that poor Miss de Villefort, whom I met on the boulevard?
104.184 --No, said the banker, I am still a little ridiculous since Benedetto's affair, and I am taking a dive.
104.185 --Bah! you are wrong; is it your fault in all this?
104.186 --Listen, my dear receiver, when one bears a name without stain like mine, one is susceptible.
104.187 -Everybody feels sorry for you, be sure of that, and, above all, everybody feels sorry for your daughter.
104.188 --Poor Eugenie!" said Danglars with a deep sigh. You know that she is entering religion, sir?
104.189 --No.
104.190 -- Alas! it is only too true. The day after the event, she decided to leave with a nun friend of hers; she is going to look for a very strict convent in Italy or Spain.
104.191 --Oh! that's terrible!"
104.192 And M. de Boville withdrew on this exclamation, paying the father a thousand compliments of condolence. But he was no sooner outside, than Danglars, with an energy of gesture which only those who have seen the representation of _Robert Macaire_, by Frederick, will understand, cried out:
104.193 "Imbecile!"
104.194 And clutching Monte Cristo's receipt in a small wallet:
104.195 "Come at noon," he added, "at noon I shall be far away."
104.196 Then he locked himself in, emptied all the drawers of his cash box, gathered about fifty thousand francs in bank bills, burned various papers, put others in evidence, and began to write a letter which he sealed, and on which he put for suscription:
104.197 "To Madame Baroness Danglars."
104.198 "Tonight," he murmured, "I will place it myself on her toilet."
104.199 Then, pulling a passport from his drawer.
104.200 "Well," he said, "it's still valid for two months."
105.000 The Père-Lachaise cemetery.
105.001 M. de Boville had, indeed, met the funeral procession that was taking Valentine to his final resting place.
105.002 The weather was dark and cloudy; a lukewarm wind, still, but already deadly to the yellowed leaves, was tearing them from the gradually stripped branches and making them swirl over the immense crowd that crowded the boulevards.
105.003 M. de Villefort, a pure Parisian, regarded the Père-Lachaise cemetery as the only one worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a Parisian family; the others seemed to him country cemeteries, hotels furnished with death. In Père-Lachaise only a deceased person of good company could be accommodated in his home.
105.004 He had bought there, as we have seen, the perpetual plot on which stood the monument so soon populated by all the members of his first family.
105.005 The pediment of the mausoleum read: SAINT-MÉRAN AND VILLEFORT FAMILY; for such had been the last wish of poor Renée, Valentine's mother.
105.006 It was thus towards Père-Lachaise that the pompous procession left the faubourg Saint-Honoré. One crossed all Paris, one took the faubourg of the Temple, then the outer boulevards until the cemetery. More than fifty carriages of masters followed twenty carriages of mourners, and, behind these fifty carriages, more than five hundred people still walked on foot.
105.007 They were almost all young people whom the death of Valentine had struck with a thunderbolt, and who, in spite of the icy vapor of the century and the prosaism of the time, underwent the poetic influence of this beautiful, this chaste, this adorable young girl taken in her flower.
105.008 On the outskirts of Paris, a fast four-horse carriage was seen arriving, which suddenly stopped, stiffening its nervous hocks like steel springs: it was M. de Monte Cristo.
105.009 The Count got out of his carriage and joined the crowd that was following the funeral cart on foot.
105.010 Château-Renaud saw him; he immediately got out of his carriage and came to join him. Beauchamp likewise left the cabriolet in which he was sitting.
105.011 The Count looked attentively through all the gaps left by the crowd; he was obviously looking for someone. Finally, he did not bother.
105.012 "Where is Morrel?" he asked. Do any of you gentlemen know where he is?
105.013 --We have already asked ourselves this question at the funeral home, said Château-Renaud; for none of us has seen him."
105.014 The Count was silent, but continued to look around.
105.015 At last they reached the cemetery. Monte Cristo's piercing eye suddenly probed the groves of yew and pine, and soon he lost all anxiety: a shadow had slipped under the black bowers, and Monte Cristo had undoubtedly just recognized what he was looking for.
105.016 One knows what it is like to be buried in this magnificent necropolis: black groups scattered in the white alleys, the silence of the sky and the earth, disturbed by the glare of a few broken branches, of some hedge sunken around a tomb; then the melancholy chanting of the priests, with here and there a sob escaping from a clump of flowers, under which one can see some woman, damaged and with her hands joined.
105.017 The shadow that Monte Cristo had noticed quickly crossed the quincunx behind the tomb of Heloise and Abelard, came to stand, with the servants of death, at the head of the horses that were dragging the body, and with the same step reached the place chosen for the burial.
105.018 Everyone was looking at something.
105.019 Monte Cristo looked only at this shadow, barely noticed by those around him.
105.020 Twice the Count stepped out of the ranks to see if the man's hands were not looking for some weapon hidden under his clothes.
105.021 This shadow, when the procession stopped, was recognized as Morrel, who, with his black frock coat buttoned up to the top, his forehead livid, his cheeks hollowed out, his hat crumpled by his convulsive hands, had leaned against a tree situated on a knoll overlooking the mausoleum, so as not to lose any of the details of the funereal ceremony that was about to take place.
105.022 Everything went according to plan. A few men, and as always they were the least impressed, a few men made speeches. Some pitied this premature death; others dwelt on the sorrow of her father; some were ingenious enough to find that this young girl had more than once solicited M. de Villefort for the guilty parties on whose heads he held the sword of justice suspended; finally, one exhausted the flowery metaphors and the painful periods, commenting in any case on the stanzas of Malherbe to Dupérier.
105.023 Monte-Cristo listened to nothing, saw nothing, or rather he saw only Morrel, whose calmness and immobility formed a frightening spectacle for the one who alone could read what was happening in the heart of the young officer.
105.024 "Well," said Beauchamp suddenly to Debray, "here is Morrel! Where the hell has he gone?"
105.025 And they pointed it out to Château-Renaud.
105.026 "How pale he is," said the latter, shivering.
105.027 --He's cold," replied Debray.
105.028 --No," said Château-Renaud slowly; "I think he is moved. He is a very impressionable man, Maximilian.
105.029 --Bah! said Debray, hardly if he knew Miss de Villefort. You said so yourself.
105.030 --That is true. I remember, however, that at that ball at Madame de Morcerf's he danced three times with her; you know, Count, at that ball where you produced so much effect.
105.031 -- "No, I don't know," replied Monte Cristo, without knowing to what or to whom he was answering, busy as he was watching Morrel, whose cheeks were becoming more animated, as happens to those who compress or hold their breath.
105.032 "The speeches are finished: farewell, gentlemen," said the Count abruptly.
105.033 And he gave the signal to leave, disappearing without anyone knowing where he had gone.
105.034 The funeral party was over, and those present took the road back to Paris.
105.035 Château-Renaud alone looked for Morrel with his eyes for a moment; but while he had followed the Count with his eyes as he went away, Morrel had left his place, and Château-Renaud, after having looked for him in vain, had followed Debray and Beauchamp.
105.036 Monte Cristo had thrown himself into a copse, and, hidden behind a large grave, he watched for the slightest movement of Morrel, who had gradually approached the mausoleum abandoned by the curious, and then by the workers.
105.037 Morrel looked around slowly and vaguely; but as his gaze took in the portion of the circle opposite his own, Monte Cristo came within ten paces again without being seen.
105.038 The young man knelt down.
105.039 The Count, his neck stretched, his eyes fixed and dilated, his hocks bent as if to spring at the first signal, continued to move closer to Morrel.
105.040 Morrel bent his forehead to the stone, kissed the gate with both hands, and whispered:
105.041 "O Valentine!"
105.042 The Count's heart was broken by the explosion of these two words; he took another step, and knocking on Morrel's shoulder:
105.043 "It is you, dear friend!" he said, "I was looking for you."
105.044 Monte-Cristo expected an outburst, reproaches, recriminations: he was mistaken.
105.045 Morrel turned to his side, and with the appearance of calm:
105.046 "You see," he said, "I was praying!"
105.047 And his scrutinizing gaze went over the young man from head to foot.
105.048 After this examination he seemed calmer.
105.049 "Do you want me to take you back to Paris?
105.050 -- No, thank you.
105.051 -- Finally, do you want something?
105.052 --Let me pray.
105.053 The Count moved away without making a single objection, but it was to take up a new post, from which he did not lose a single gesture from Morrel, who at last got up, wiped his stone-white knees, and took the road to Paris again without turning his head once.
105.054 He walked slowly down the Rue de la Roquette.
105.055 The Count, dismissing his carriage which was parked at Père-Lachaise, followed him a hundred paces. Maximilien crossed the canal, and returned to rue Meslay by the boulevards.
105.056 Five minutes after the door closed for Morrel, it reopened for Monte Cristo.
105.057 Julie was at the entrance to the garden, where she was watching, with the deepest attention, Master Peneton, who, taking his profession of gardener seriously, was taking cuttings of the Bengal rose.
105.058 "Ah, Monsieur le Comte de Monte-Cristo!" she exclaimed with that joy which every member of the family usually manifested when Monte-Cristo made his visit to the Rue Meslay.
105.059 --Maximilian has just returned, has he not, madam?
105.060 --I think I saw him pass, yes," said the young woman; "but, please, call Emmanuel.
105.061 --Pardon, madam; but I must go up at once to Maximilian's, replied Monte Cristo, I have to tell him something of the greatest importance.
105.062 - Go, then," she said, accompanying him with her charming smile until he had disappeared down the stairs.
105.063 Monte Cristo had soon crossed the two floors which separated the first floor from Maximilian's apartment; having reached the landing, he listened: no noise was heard.
105.064 As in most of the old houses inhabited by a single master, the landing was closed only by a glass door.
105.065 Only there was no key to this glass door. Maximilian had locked himself in; but it was impossible to see beyond the door, a red silk curtain lining the windows.
105.066 The Count's anxiety was expressed by a bright blush, an unusual symptom of emotion in this impassive man.
105.067 "What shall I do?" he murmured.
105.068 And he thought for a moment.
105.069 "Ring the bell?" he resumed, "oh, no! often the sound of a bell, that is, of a visit, accelerates the resolution of those who find themselves in the situation in which Maximilian must be at this moment, and then to the sound of the bell answers another sound."
105.070 Monte Cristo shivered from head to foot, and, as with him the decision had the rapidity of lightning, he struck a blow with his elbow in one of the panes of the glass door, which flew into splinters; then he lifted the curtain and saw Morrel, who, in front of his desk, with a quill in his hand, had just leaped up on his chair, at the crash of the broken glass.
105.071 "It is nothing," said the Count, "a thousand pardons, my dear friend! I slipped, and in slipping I elbowed your window; since it is broken, I will take advantage of it to enter your house; do not disturb yourself, do not disturb yourself."
105.072 And, passing his arm through the broken window, the Count opened the door.
105.073 Morrel rose, evidently annoyed, and came to meet Monte Cristo, not so much to receive him as to bar his way.
105.074 "Well, it's the fault of your servants," said Monte Cristo, rubbing his elbow, "your floors are shiny as mirrors.
105.075 --Are you hurt, sir?" asked Morrel coldly.
105.076 --I don't know. But what were you doing there? Were you writing?
105.077 --Me?
105.078 --Your fingers are stained with ink.
105.079 --That's true," replied Morrel, "I was writing; that happens to me sometimes, all military man that I am."
105.080 Monte Cristo took a few steps into the apartment. Maximilian was forced to let him pass; but he followed him.
105.081 "You were writing?" resumed Monte Cristo with a weary look of fixity.
105.082 -- "I have already had the honor of telling you that I was," said Morrel.
105.083 The Count glanced around.
105.084 "Your pistols next to the writing desk!" he said, pointing to the weapons on his desk.
105.085 --I am leaving on a journey," replied Maximilian.
105.086 -My friend! said Monte Cristo with a voice of infinite sweetness.
105.087 --Monsieur!
105.088 -My friend, my dear Maximilian, no extreme resolutions, I beg you!
105.089 --Me, extreme resolutions, said Morrel, shrugging his shoulders; and in what way, I pray you, is a journey an extreme resolution?
105.090 - "Maximilian," said Monte Cristo, "let us each put on the mask we are wearing.
105.091 "Maximilian, you do not deceive me with this calm command more than I deceive you with my frivolous solicitude.
105.092 "You do understand, don't you? that to have done what I did, to have broken windows, to have violated the secret of a friend's room, you understand, I say, that to have done all that, I had to have had a real concern, or rather a terrible conviction.
105.093 "Morrel, you want to kill yourself!
105.094 "Well," said Morrel, shaking, "where do you get such ideas, Monsieur le Comte?
105.095 --I tell you that you want to kill yourself!" continued the Count in the same tone of voice, "and here is the proof.
105.096 And, approaching the desk, he lifted the blank sheet of paper which the young man had thrown over a started letter, and took the letter.
105.097 Morrel rushed to snatch it from his hands. But Monte Cristo foresaw this movement and prevented it by seizing Maximilien by the wrist and stopping him as the steel chain stops the spring in the middle of its evolution.
105.098 "You see that you wanted to kill yourself! Morrel," said the Count, "it is written!
105.099 --Well," cried Morrel, passing without transition from the appearance of calm to the expression of violence, "when that happens, when I have decided to turn the barrel of this pistol on myself, who will stop me?
105.100 "Who would have the courage to stop me?
105.101 "When I say:
105.102 "All my hopes are ruined, my heart is broken, my life is extinguished, there is nothing but mourning and disgust around me; the earth has become ashes; every human voice tears me apart;
105.103 "When I say:
105.104 "It is mercy to let me die, for if you do not let me die I will lose my mind, I will go mad;
105.105 "Let's see, tell me, sir, when I say this, when they see that I say it with the anguish and tears of my heart, will they answer me:
105.106 --You are wrong?"
105.107 "Will they prevent me from being the most unhappy?
105.108 "Say, sir, say, is it you who will have this courage?
105.109 -- "Yes, Morrel," said Monte Cristo, in a voice whose calmness contrasted strangely with the exaltation of the young man; "yes, it will be me.
105.110 --You! You who have lured me with an absurd hope; you who have held me back, lulled me to sleep with vain promises, when I could have saved her, or at least seen her die in my arms, by some brilliant stroke, by some extreme resolution; You who use all the resources of intelligence, all the powers of matter; you who play, or rather pretend to play, the role of Providence, and who have not even had the power to give counter-poison to a poisoned girl! Ah, in truth, sir, you would make me pity you if you did not make me hate you!
105.111 --Morrel...
105.112 --Yes, you told me to put on the mask; well, be satisfied, I am putting it on.
105.113 "Yes, when you followed me to the cemetery, I answered you again, because my heart is good; when you entered, I let you come all the way here... But since you abuse me, since you come to defy me even in this room where I had retired as if to my grave; since you bring me a new torture, to me who thought I had exhausted them all, Count of Monte Cristo, my pretended benefactor, Count of Monte Cristo, the universal savior, be satisfied, you are going to see your friend die!..."
105.114 And Morrel, with the laughter of madness on his lips, sprang a second time to the pistols.
105.115 Monte Cristo, pale as a ghost, but his eye dazzling with lightning, stretched out his hand on the weapons, and said to the fool:
105.116 "And, I repeat, you will not kill yourself!
105.117 --Prevent me from doing so!" replied Morrel with a last impulse which, like the first, broke against the steel arm of the count.
105.118 --I will prevent you!
105.119 --But who are you, in the end, to arrogate to yourself this tyrannical right over free and thinking creatures!
105.120 --Who am I?" repeated Monte Cristo.
105.121 "Listen:
105.122 "I am," continued Monte Cristo, "the only man in the world who has the right to say to you: 'Morrel I do not want your father's son to die today!"
105.123 And Monte Cristo, majestic, transfigured, sublime, advanced with both arms crossed towards the palpitating young man, who, overcome in spite of himself by the almost divine nature of this man, drew back a step.
105.124 "Why are you talking about my father?" he stammered; "why are you mixing the memory of my father with what is happening to me today?
105.125 --Because I am the man who once saved your father's life when he wanted to kill himself as you want to kill yourself today; because I am the man who sent the purse to your young sister and _Le Pharaon_ to old Morrel; because I am Edmond Dantes, who made you play, as a child, on his knee!"
105.126 Morrel took another step backward, staggering, suffocating, panting, crushed; then his strength deserted him, and with a great cry he fell prostrate at Monte Cristo's feet.
105.127 Then suddenly, in this admirable nature, there was a movement of sudden and complete regeneration: he got up, leaped out of the room, and rushed up the stairs shouting with all the power of his voice:
105.128 "Julie! Julie! Emmanuel! Emmanuel!"
105.129 Monte-Cristo wanted to rush up in his turn, but Maximilien would have been killed rather than leave the hinges of the door which he pushed back on the Count.
105.130 At Maximilian's cries, Julie, Emmanuel, Peneton and some of the servants came running in fear.
105.131 Morrel took them by the hands, and opened the door again:
105.132 "On your knees!" he cried in a voice choked with sobs; "on your knees! it is the benefactor, it is the savior of our father! it is..."
105.133 He was about to say:
105.134 "It is Edmond Dantes!"
105.135 The Count stopped him by seizing his arm.
105.136 Julie sprang upon the Count's hand; Emmanuel embraced him like a tutelary god; Morrel fell for the second time on his knees, and struck the floor with his forehead.
105.137 Then the bronze man felt his heart expand in his chest, a jet of devouring flame burst from his throat to his eyes, he bowed his head and wept!
105.138 For a few moments in that room there was a concert of tears and sublime groans which must have seemed harmonious to the very angels most beloved of the Lord!
105.139 Julie had scarcely recovered from the deep emotion she had just experienced, when she rushed out of the room, descended a floor, ran to the salon with childish joy, and lifted the crystal globe which protected the purse given by the stranger from the Allées de Meilhan.
105.140 In the meantime, Emmanuel in a broken voice said to the count
105.141 "Oh, Monsieur le Comte, how, seeing us speak so often of our unknown benefactor, how, seeing us surround a memory with so much gratitude and adoration, how did you wait until today to make yourself known? Oh, this is cruelty to us, and, I dare almost say, sir count, to yourself.
105.142 -- "Listen, my friend," said the Count, "and I can call you that, for, without suspecting it, you have been my friend for eleven years; the discovery of this secret has been brought about by a great event of which you must be ignorant.
105.143 "God is my witness that I wished to bury it all my life in the depths of my soul; your brother Maximilian snatched it from me by violence, for which I am sure he repents."
105.144 Then, seeing that Maximilian had thrown himself aside on an armchair, while nevertheless remaining on his knees:
105.145 "Watch over him," added Monte Cristo, pressing Emmanuel's hand in a significant way.
105.146 --Why is that?" asked the astonished young man.
105.147 --I cannot tell you; but watch over him."
105.148 Emmanuel embraced the room with a circular glance and saw Morrel's pistols.
105.149 His eyes fixed fearfully on the weapons, which he pointed out to Monte Cristo by slowly raising his finger to their height.
105.150 Monte Cristo bowed his head.
105.151 Emmanuel made a movement toward the pistols.
105.152 "Leave it," said the Count.
105.153 Then going to Morrel he took his hand; the tumultuous movements which had for a moment shaken the heart of the young man had given way to a profound stupor.
105.154 Julie went up again, she held the silk purse in her hand, and two bright and joyful tears rolled down her cheeks like two drops of morning dew.
105.155 "Here is the line," she said; "don't think that it is any less dear to me since the Savior has been revealed to us.
105.156 - "My child," replied Monte Cristo, blushing, "allow me to take back this purse; since you know the features of my face, I only want to be remembered by the affection I beg you to bestow on me.
105.157 --Oh!" said Julie, pressing the purse to her heart, "no, no, I beg you, for one day you may leave us; for one day, unfortunately, you will leave us, won't you?
105.158 -- "You have guessed right, madam," replied Monte Cristo, smiling; "in eight days I shall have left this country, where so many people who had deserved Heaven's vengeance lived happily, while my father expired of hunger and pain."
105.159 As he announced his forthcoming departure, Monte Cristo held his eyes fixed on Morrel, and he noticed that these words _I will have left this country_ had passed without rousing Morrel from his lethargy; he understood that it was a last struggle which he had to sustain with his friend's grief, and taking the hands of Julie and Emmanuel, which he brought together by pressing them into his own, he said to them, with the gentle authority of a father:
105.160 "My good friends, leave me alone, I pray you, with Maximilian."
105.161 It was a way for Julie to take away this precious relic of which Monte Cristo forgot to speak again. She dragged her husband along briskly.
105.162 "Let's leave them," she said.
105.163 The Count stayed with Morrel, who remained as still as a statue.
105.164 "Let's see," said the Count, touching his shoulder with his finger of flame; "are you becoming a man again, Maximilian?
105.165 --Yes, for I am beginning to suffer again."
105.166 The Count's brow wrinkled, given over as he seemed to be to a dark hesitation.
105.167 "Maximilian! Maximilian!" he said, "these ideas into which you are plunging are unworthy of a Christian.
105.168 -- "Don't worry, friend," said Morrel, raising his head and showing the Count a smile tinged with ineffable sadness, "it is no longer I who will seek death.
105.169 --And so, said Monte Cristo, no more weapons, no more despair.
105.170 --No, for I have better things to cure me of my pain than the barrel of a pistol or the point of a knife.
105.171 -- Poor fool...! What is the matter with you?
105.172 -- I have my own pain that will kill me.
105.173 --Ami, said Monte Cristo with a melancholy equal to his own, listen to me:
105.174 "One day, in a moment of despair equal to yours, since it brought about a similar resolution, I like you wanted to kill myself; one day your father, equally desperate, wanted to kill himself too.
105.175 "If someone had said to your father, at the moment when he was pointing the barrel of the pistol at his forehead, if someone had said to me, at the moment when I was pushing away from my bed the bread of the prisoner to whom I had not touched for three days, if someone had finally said to both of us, in that supreme moment
105.176 "Live! a day will come when you will be happy and when you will bless life, from wherever the voice came, we would have welcomed it with the smile of doubt or with the anguish of incredulity, and yet how many times, kissing you, did your father bless life, how many times did I...
105.177 --Ah! exclaimed Morrel, interrupting the Count, you had lost only your freedom; my father had lost only his fortune; and I have lost Valentine.
I have no tears in my eyes, no fever in my veins, no mournful beating in my heart, yet I see you suffering, you, Maximilian, you whom I love as I would my son: well, does that not tell you, Morrel, that pain is like life, and that there is always something unknown beyond? Now, if I beg you, if I order you to live, Morrel, it is in the conviction that one day you will thank me for having kept you alive.
105.179 -My God!" cried the young man, "my God! what are you saying to me, Count? Take care! Perhaps you have never loved?
105.180 --Child!" replied the Count.
105.181 - "Love," said Morrel, "I understand.
105.182 "I, you see, have been a soldier since I was a man; I have reached the age of twenty-nine without loving, for none of the feelings I have experienced up to that point deserve the name of love: well, at twenty-nine I saw Valentine: therefore for nearly two years I have loved her, for nearly two years I have been able to read the virtues of the girl and the woman written by the very hand of the Lord in this heart open to me like a book.
105.183 "Count, there was for me, with Valentine, an infinite, immense, unknown happiness, a happiness too great, too complete, too divine, for this world; since this world has not given it to me, Count, it is to tell you that without Valentine there is for me on earth only despair and desolation.
105.184 -- I told you to hope, Morrel," repeated the Count.
105.185 --Beware then, I will repeat also, said Morrel, for you seek to persuade me, and if you persuade me, you will make me lose my reason, for you will make me believe that I can see Valentine again."
105.186 The count smiled.
105.187 "My friend, my father!" exclaimed Morrel exultantly, "beware," I will tell you again for the third time, "for the ascendancy you are taking over me appalls me; beware of the meaning of your words, for here are my eyes reviving, here is my heart rekindling and being reborn; beware, for you would make me believe in supernatural things.
105.188 "I would obey if you commanded me to lift the stone from the tomb that covers Jairus' daughter; I would walk on the waves, like the apostle, if you beckoned me with your hand to walk on the waves; beware, I will obey.
105.189 --Hope, my friend," repeated the Count.
105.190 --Ah! said Morrel, falling back from the height of his exaltation into the abyss of his sadness, ah! you are playing with me: you are doing like those good mothers, or rather like those selfish mothers who calm the pain of the child with honeyed words, because its cries tire them.
105.191 "No, my friend, I was wrong to tell you to be careful; no, don't be afraid, I will bury my pain so carefully in the depths of my chest, I will make it so obscure, so secret, that you will not even care to sympathize with it.
105.192 "Good-bye, my friend; good-bye!
105.193 --On the contrary, said the Count; from this hour, Maximilian, you will live near me and with me, you will never leave me again, and in eight days we will have left France behind us.
105.194 --And you still tell me to hope?
105.195 --I tell you to hope, because I know a way to cure you.
105.196 --Count, you sadden me even more if it is possible. You see, as the result of the blow that strikes me, only a commonplace pain, and you believe you can console me by a commonplace means, travel."
105.197 And Morrel shook his head in disdainful disbelief.
105.198 "What do you want me to say?" resumed Monte Cristo.
105.199 "I have faith in my promises, let me make the experiment.
105.200 --Count, you are prolonging my agony, that is all.
105.201 --So, says the Count, weak hearted as you are, you don't have the strength to give your friend a few days for the trial he is attempting!
105.202 "Let's see, do you know what the Count of Monte Cristo is capable of?
105.203 "Do you know that he commands many earthly powers?
105.204 "Do you know that he has enough faith in God to obtain miracles from him who said that with faith man could lift a mountain?
105.205 "Well, this miracle that I hope for, wait for it, or else...
105.206 --Or else... Morrel repeated.
105.207 --Or else, beware, Morrel, I will call you ungrateful.
105.208 --Have mercy on me, Count.
105.209 --I have so much pity on you, Maximilian, listen to me, so much pity, that if I do not cure you in a month, day for day, hour for hour, mark my words, Morrel, I will place you myself in front of these pistols fully loaded and a cup of the surest poison in Italy, a surer and more swift poison, believe me, than that which killed Valentine.
105.210 --Do you promise me that?
105.211 -- Yes, for I am a man, for I too, as I told you, have wanted to die, and often, since misfortune has departed from me, I have dreamed of the delights of eternal sleep.
105.212 --Oh, of course, you promise me that, Count? cried Maximilian intoxicated.
105.213 --I do not promise it, I swear it, said Monte Cristo, extending his hand.
105.214 --In a month, on your honor, if I am not consoled, you will let me free with my life, and, whatever I do with it, you will not call me ungrateful?
105.215 --In a month to the day, Maximilian; in a month, hour for hour, and the date is sacred, Maximilian; I don't know whether you have thought of it, today is the 5th of September.
105.216 "It is ten years ago today that I saved your father, who wanted to die."
105.217 Morrel seized the Count's hands and kissed them; the Count let him, as if he understood that this adoration was due to him.
105.218 "In a month," Monte Cristo continued, "you will have, on the table before which we will sit each other, good weapons and a sweet death; but, on the other hand, you promise me to wait until then and to live?
105.219 --Oh! my turn," cried Morrel, "I swear it!"
105.220 Monte Cristo drew the young man to his heart, and held him there a long time.
105.221 "And now," he said to him, "from today you will come and stay with me; you will take Haydée's apartment, and my daughter at least will be replaced by my son.
105.222 --Haydee!" said Morrel; "what has become of Haydee?
105.223 --She left last night.
105.224 --To leave you?
105.225 --To wait for me...
105.226 "So be ready to come and join me on the Rue des Champs-Élysées, and get me out of here without anyone seeing me."
105.227 Maximilian bowed his head, and obeyed like a child or like an apostle.
106.000 The division.
106.001 In this hotel in the rue Saint-Germain-des-Prés which Albert de Morcerf had chosen for his mother and himself, the second floor, consisting of a small apartment, was rented to a very mysterious person.
106.002 This personage was a man whose face the concierge himself had never been able to see, either when he entered or when he left; for in winter he would bury his chin in one of those red ties like the coachmen of good houses who wait for their masters at the exit of the shows, and in summer he always blew his nose precisely at the moment when he could have been seen while passing in front of the lodge. It must be said that, contrary to all received customs, this inhabitant of the hotel was not spied upon by anyone, and that the rumor that ran that his incognito concealed a very high ranking individual, and _ayant le bras long_, had made his mysterious appearances respected.
106.003 His visits were usually fixed, though sometimes they were advanced or delayed; but almost always, winter or summer, it was about four o'clock that he took possession of his apartment, in which he never spent the night.
106.004 At half past three in the winter the fire was lit by the discreet servant who had the stewardship of the little apartment; at half past three in the summer, ice was put up by the same servant.
106.005 At four o'clock, as we have said, the mysterious character arrived.
106.006 Twenty minutes after him, a carriage stopped in front of the hotel; a woman dressed in black or dark blue, but always wrapped in a large veil, got out, passed like a shadow in front of the lodge, and climbed the stairs without a single step being heard to creak under her light foot.
106.007 It never happened that anyone asked her where she was going.
106.008 Her face, like that of the stranger, was thus perfectly foreign to the two guards of the door, these model concierges, the only ones perhaps, in the immense brotherhood of the doormen of the capital capable of such discretion.
106.009 It goes without saying that it did not go up higher than the first. She scratched at a door in a particular way; the door opened, then closed again hermetically, and all was said.
106.010 To leave the hotel, the same maneuver as to enter it.
106.011 The stranger came out first, still veiled, and got back into her car, which sometimes disappeared at one end of the street, sometimes at the other; then, twenty minutes later, the stranger came out in his turn, tucked into his tie or hidden by his handkerchief, and disappeared as well.
106.012 The day after the Count of Monte Cristo had gone to visit Danglars, the day of Valentine's funeral, the mysterious inhabitant entered at about ten o'clock in the morning, instead of the usual four in the afternoon.
106.013 Almost at once, and without keeping the ordinary interval, a carriage arrived, and the veiled lady went quickly up the stairs.
106.014 The door opened and closed.
106.015 But even before the door was closed, the lady had cried out:
106.016 "O Lucien! O my friend!"
106.017 So that the janitor, who, without meaning to, had heard this exclamation, knew then for the first time that his tenant was called Lucien; but as he was a model doorman, he promised himself not even to tell his wife.
106.018 "Well, what is it, dear friend?" asked the man whose name the veiled lady's trouble or eagerness had revealed; "speak, say.
106.019 -My friend, can I count on you?
106.020 - Certainly, and you know it well.
106.021 "But what is it?
106.022 "Your bill of this morning has thrown me into a terrible perplexity.
106.023 "This haste, this disorder in your writing; let's see, reassure me or frighten me completely!
106.024 --Lucien, a great event!" said the lady, fixing on Lucien a questioning glance: "Mr. Danglars has left this night.
106.025 --Gone! Mr. Danglars gone!
106.026 "And where did he go?
106.027 --I don't know.
106.028 -How can you not know? So he left to never come back?
106.029 --Surely!
106.030 "At ten o'clock in the evening, his horses led him to the barrier of Charenton; there he found a post office sedan all harnessed; he got into it with his valet, telling his coachman that he was going to Fontainebleau.
106.031 --Well, what did you say?
106.032 -Wait, my friend. He had left me a letter.
106.033 --A letter?
106.034 --Yes; read it."
106.035 And the baroness drew from her pocket an unsealed letter which she presented to Debray.
106.036 Debray, before reading it, hesitated for a moment, as if he were trying to guess what it contained, or rather as if, whatever it contained, he was decided to take a decision in advance.
106.037 After a few seconds his thoughts were undoubtedly fixed, for he read.
106.038 Here is what was in the bill that had thrown so much confusion into Mrs. Danglars' heart:
106.039 "Madame and most faithful wife."
106.040 Without thinking about it, Debray stopped and looked at the baroness, who blushed to her eyes.
106.041 "Read," she said.
106.042 Debray continued:
106.043 "When you receive this letter you will no longer have a husband! Oh, don't take the alarm too warmly, you won't have a husband anymore, just as you won't have a daughter, that is, I will be on one of the thirty or forty roads that lead out of France.
106.044 "I owe you explanations, and since you are a woman who understands them perfectly, I will give them to you.
106.045 "Listen, then:
106.046 "A repayment of five million came to me this morning, I made it; another of the same amount followed almost immediately; I am postponing it until tomorrow: today I am leaving to avoid that tomorrow, which would be too unpleasant for me to bear.
106.047 "You understand that, don't you, my lady and most precious wife?
106.048 "I say:
106.049 "You understand, because you know my affairs as well as I do; you even know them better than I do, since if it were a question of telling where a good half of my fortune, which was once still quite handsome, has gone, I would be incapable of doing so; whereas you, on the contrary, I am sure, would do it perfectly.
106.050 "For women have instincts of infallible certainty; they explain the marvelous itself by an algebra which they have invented. I, who only knew my numbers, no longer knew anything from the day my numbers deceived me.
106.051 "Have you ever admired the rapidity of my fall, madam?
106.052 "Have you been a little dazzled by this incandescent fusion of my ingots?
106.053 "I confess that I saw only fire; let us hope that you found some gold in the ashes.
106.054 "It is with this consoling hope that I leave, Madam and most prudent wife, without my conscience reproaching me in the least for abandoning you; you still have friends, the ashes in question, and, to top it all off, the freedom that I am hastening to give you back.
106.055 "However, madam, the moment has arrived to place in this paragraph a word of intimate explanation. As long as I hoped that you were working for the welfare of our house, for the fortune of our daughter, I philosophically closed my eyes; but since you have made the house a vast ruin, I do not want to serve as a foundation for the fortune of others.
106.056 "I took you rich, but not very honored.
106.057 "Forgive me for speaking to you with this frankness; but as I am probably speaking only for the two of us, I do not see why I should blur my words.
106.058 "I have increased our fortune, which for more than fifteen years has been growing, until unknown and still unintelligible disasters have come to take it over and overturn it, without, I can say, any fault of mine.
106.059 "You, madam, have only worked to increase your own, and I am morally convinced that you have succeeded.
106.060 "So I leave you as I took you, rich, but not very honorable.
106.061 "Goodbye.
106.062 "I, too, am going to work for myself from today.
106.063 "Believe in all my gratitude for the example you have given me and which I will follow.
106.064 "_Your most devoted husband_,
106.065 "BARON DANGLARS."
106.066 The baroness had followed Debray with her eyes during this long and painful reading; she had seen, in spite of his well-known power over himself, the young man change color once or twice.
106.067 When he had finished, he slowly closed the paper in its folds, and resumed his pensive attitude.
106.068 "Well?" asked Madame Danglars with an anxiety that was easy to understand.
106.069 --Well, madame?" repeated Debray mechanically.
106.070 --What idea does this letter inspire in you?
106.071 --That's very simple, madame; it inspires me with the idea that M. Danglars has left with suspicions.
106.072 --Surely; but is that all you have to say to me?
106.073 --I don't understand," said Debray with a coldness that was icy.
106.074 --He's gone! Gone altogether! Gone never to return.
106.075 --Oh!" said Debray, "don't believe that, Baroness.
106.076 -- No, I tell you, he will not come back; I know him, he is a man who is unshakeable in all the resolutions that emanate from his interest.
106.077 "If he had considered me useful for anything, he would have taken me away. He leaves me in Paris, because our separation can serve his plans: it is therefore irrevocable and I am free forever," added Mme. Danglars with the same expression of prayer.
106.078 But Debray, instead of answering, left her in this anxious interrogation of the look and of the thought.
106.079 "What!" she said at last, "you don't answer me, sir?
106.080 --But I have only one question to ask you: what do you intend to do?
106.081 -- I was going to ask you that," answered the baroness, her heart throbbing.
106.082 --Ah!" said Debray, "is this advice you are asking me?
106.083 --Yes, it is advice that I ask you, said the baroness with a tight heart.
106.084 --So, if it is advice that you ask me, replied the young man coldly, I advise you to travel.
106.085 --To travel!" murmured Madame Danglars.
106.086 --Certainly. As Mr. Danglars said, you are rich and perfectly free. An absence from Paris will be absolutely necessary, at least I think so, after the double glare of Miss Eugenie's broken marriage and the disappearance of M. Danglars.
106.087 "It is only important that everyone should know that you are abandoned and believe you to be poor; for one would not forgive the banker's wife her opulence and her great state of house.
106.088 "For the first case, it is enough for you to stay only a fortnight in Paris, repeating to everyone that you are abandoned and telling your best friends, who will go and repeat it in the world, how this abandonment took place. Then you will leave your hotel, you will leave your jewels there, you will give up your dower, and everyone will praise your disinterestedness and sing your praises.
106.089 "Then you will be known to be abandoned, and you will be thought to be poor; for I alone know your financial situation and am ready to render you my accounts as a loyal partner."
106.090 The baroness, pale, appalled, had listened to this speech with as much terror and despair as Debray had put calm and indifference into pronouncing it.
106.091 "Abandoned!" she repeated, "well abandoned... Yes, you are right, sir, and no one will doubt my abandonment."
106.092 These were the only words that this woman, so proud and so violently infatuated, could answer Debray.
106.093 "But rich, very rich indeed," continued Debray, drawing from his wallet and spreading on the table some of the papers it contained.
106.094 Mrs. Danglars let him do this, busy stifling the beating of her heart and holding back the tears that she felt springing to the edge of her eyelids. But at last the feeling of dignity prevailed in the baroness; and if she did not succeed in compressing her heart, she at least managed not to shed a tear.
106.095 "Madame," said Debray, "it is about six months since we became partners.
106.096 "You have provided a down payment of one hundred thousand francs.
106.097 "It was in April of this year that our association took place.
106.098 "In May, our operations began.
106.099 "In May, we earned four hundred and fifty thousand francs.
106.100 "In June, the profit rose to nine hundred thousand.
106.101 "In July, we added seventeen hundred thousand francs; it is, as you know, the month of the Spanish bonds.
106.102 "In August, we lost, at the beginning of the month, three hundred thousand francs; but on the 15th of the month we made up for it, and in the end we took our revenge; for our accounts, put to the net from the day of our association until yesterday when I closed them, give us an asset of two million four hundred thousand francs, that is, twelve hundred thousand francs for each of us.
106.103 "Now," continued Debray, compiling his notebook with the method and tranquility of a stockbroker, "we find eighty thousand francs for the compound interest of this sum which has remained in my hands.
106.104 --But, interrupted the baroness, what does this interest mean, since you have never made use of this money?
106.105 "I beg your pardon, madam," said Debray coldly; "I had your powers to make use of it, and I used your powers.
106.106 "It is thus forty thousand francs of interest for your half, plus the one hundred thousand francs of initial capital outlay, that is, thirteen hundred and forty thousand francs for your share.
106.107 "Now, madam," continued Debray, "I had the precaution of mobilizing your money the day before yesterday, not long ago, as you see, and it seemed as if I suspected that I would soon be called upon to render you an account. Your money is here, half in bank bills, half in bearer bonds.
106.108 "I say there, and it's true: because I didn't consider my house safe enough, because I didn't find the notaries discreet enough, and because property speaks even louder than the notaries; because, finally, you have no right to buy anything or to possess anything outside the conjugal community, I have kept all this money, today your only fortune, in a safe sealed at the back of this cupboard, and for greater security, I have done the masonry myself.
106.109 "Now," continued Debray, opening the cupboard first, and then the cash box, "now, madame, here are eight hundred bills of a thousand francs each, which look, as you see, like a large iron-bound album; I enclose a coupon for an annuity of twenty-five thousand francs; then for the balance, which makes something, I think, like a hundred and ten thousand francs, here is a sight- voucher on my banker, and as my banker is not M. Danglars, the voucher will be paid, so you can rest easy."
106.110 Mrs. Danglars mechanically took the sight voucher, the annuity coupon and the bundle of bank bills.
106.111 This enormous fortune seemed very little spread out on a table.
106.112 Mrs. Danglars, her eyes dry, but her chest swollen with sobs, picked it up and locked the steel case in her purse, put the coupon and the sight voucher in her wallet, and standing, pale, mute, she waited for a sweet word that would console her for being so rich.
106.113 But she waited in vain.
106.114 "Now, madam," said Debray, "you have a magnificent existence, something like sixty thousand pounds of income, which is enormous for a woman who will not be able to keep house for at least a year.
106.115 "It is a privilege for all the fantasies that will pass through your mind: not to mention that if you find your share insufficient, in view of the past that escapes you, you can draw from mine, madam; and I am willing to offer you, oh! as a loan, of course, all that I possess, that is to say, one million sixty thousand francs.
106.116 --Thank you, sir," replied the baroness, "thank you; you understand that you are handing over to me much more than is necessary for a poor woman who does not intend, for a long time at least, to reappear in the world."
106.117 Debray was astonished for a moment, but he recovered himself and made a gesture which could be translated into the most polite way of expressing this idea:
106.118 "As you please!"
106.119 Mrs. Danglars had perhaps up to that point still hoped for something; but when she saw the careless gesture which had just escaped Debray, and the oblique glance with which that gesture was accompanied, as well as the deep reverence and significant silence which followed them, she raised her head, opened the door, and without fury, without jerkiness, but also without hesitation, she dashed up the stairs, disdaining even to address a last greeting to the one who was letting her go in this way.
106.120 "Bah!" said Debray when she had gone: fine projects that all this is, she will remain in her hotel, read novels, and play lansquenet, not being able to play the stock market any more."
106.121 And he took up his notebook again, crossing out with the greatest care the sums he had just paid.
106.122 "I have one million sixty thousand francs left," he said.
106.123 "What a misfortune that Miss de Villefort is dead! That woman suited me in every way, and I would have married her."
106.124 And phlegmatically, according to his habit, he waited until Mrs. Danglars had been gone twenty minutes before deciding to leave in his turn.
106.125 During these twenty minutes, Debray made figures, his watch placed beside him.
106.126 That diabolical character that every adventurous imagination would have created with more or less happiness if The Wise Man had not acquired ownership of it in his masterpiece, Asmodeus, who removed the crust from houses to see their interior, would have enjoyed a singular spectacle if he had removed, at the moment Debray was doing his numbers, the crust from the little hotel in the rue Saint-Germain-des-Prés.
106.127 Above this room where Debray had just shared two and a half millions with Mrs. Danglars, there was another room also populated by inhabitants of our acquaintance, who played an important enough role in the events we have just recounted for us to find them with some interest.
106.128 In this room there were Mercedes and Albert.
106. 129 Mercedes had changed a great deal in the last few days, not that, even in the time of her greatest fortune, she had ever displayed the proud pomp which stands in visible contrast to all conditions, and makes a woman unrecognizable as soon as she appears to you in simpler clothes; Not that she had fallen into that state of depression where one is forced to put on the livery of misery; no, Mercedes was changed because her eye no longer shone, because her mouth no longer smiled, because finally a perpetual embarrassment stopped on her lips the quick word that an always prepared mind used to throw out.
106.130 It was not poverty that had withered the spirit of Mercedes, it was not the lack of courage that made her poverty heavy.
106.131 Mercedes, descended from the environment in which she lived, lost in the new sphere which she had chosen for herself, like those people who leave a splendidly illuminated salon to pass suddenly into darkness; Mercedes seemed a queen descended from her palace into a thatched cottage, and who, reduced to the bare necessities, does not recognize herself either by the clay dishes which she is obliged to bring herself on her table, or by the bed which has succeeded her bed.
106. 132 Indeed, the beautiful Catalan or the noble countess did not have any more her proud glance, nor her charming smile, because by stopping her eyes on what surrounded her she saw only distressing objects: it was a room wallpapered with one of those gray-on-gray papers which thrifty landlords prefer to choose as the least soiled; it was a tile without a carpet; it was furniture which called attention and forced the view to stop at the poverty of a false luxury, all things finally which broke by their gaudy tones the harmony so necessary to eyes accustomed to an elegant whole.
106. 133 Mme. de Morcerf had been living there since she left her hotel; her head turned before this eternal silence as it does to a traveler who has arrived on the edge of an abyss: Noticing that Albert was looking at her every minute from behind the scenes to judge the state of her heart, she had forced herself into a monotonous smile of the lips which, in the absence of that sweet fire of the smile of the eyes, has the effect of a simple reverberation of light, that is to say, of a brightness without warmth.
106.134 On his side Albert was preoccupied, uneasy, embarrassed by a remainder of luxury which prevented him from being of his current condition; he wanted to leave without gloves, and found his hands too white; he wanted to run the city on foot, and found his boots too well varnished.
106.135 However, these two creatures, so noble and so intelligent, united indissolubly by the bond of maternal and filial love, had succeeded in understanding each other without speaking of anything, and in sparing all the privations that one owes each other between friends in order to establish that material truth on which life depends.
106.136 Albert had finally been able to say to his mother without making her pale:
106.137 "Mother, we have no more money."
106.138 Mercédès had never really known misery; she had often, in her youth, spoken herself of poverty, but it is not the same thing: need and necessity are two synonyms between which there is a whole world of interval.
106.139 In the Catalans, Mercedes needed a thousand things, but she never lacked some others. As long as the nets were good, they caught fish; as long as they sold fish, they had thread to maintain the nets.
106.140 And then, isolated of friendship, having only a love which was for nothing in the material details of the situation, one thought of oneself, each one to oneself, only to oneself.
106.141 Mercédès, of the little that she had, made her share as generously as possible: today she had two shares to make, and that with nothing.
106.142 Winter was approaching: Mercedes, in this bare and already cold room, had no fire, she whose thousand-branched calorifier once heated the house from the anterooms to the boudoir; she had not a single poor little flower, she whose apartment was a warm greenhouse filled at a high price!
106.143 But she had her son...
106.144 The exaltation of a perhaps exaggerated duty had sustained them until then in the higher spheres.
106.145 Exaltation is almost enthusiasm, and enthusiasm makes one insensitive to earthly things.
106.146 But the enthusiasm had calmed down, and it was necessary to descend little by little from the land of dreams to the world of realities.
106.147 It was necessary to talk about the positive, after having exhausted all the ideal.
106.148 "My mother," said Albert, as Mrs. Danglars descended the stairs, "let's count all our wealth a little, please; I need a total to make my plans.
106.149 --Total: nothing, said Mercedes with a painful smile.
106.150 --So done, my mother, total: three thousand francs, first, and I have the pretension, with these three thousand francs, to lead between us an adorable life.
106.151 --Child! sighed Mercedes.
106.152 -- "Alas, my good mother," said the young man, "I have unfortunately spent enough money on you to know the price.
106.153 "It is enormous, you see, three thousand francs, and on this sum I have built a miraculous future of eternal security.
106.154 -- You say that, my friend," continued the poor mother; "but first do we accept these three thousand francs?" said Mercedes, blushing.
106.155 "But it is agreed, it seems to me," said Albert in a firm tone; "we accept them all the more because we don't have them, for they are, as you know, buried in the garden of this little house in the Allées de Meilhan in Marseille.
106.156 "With two hundred francs," said Albert, "we will both go to Marseille.
106.157 --With two hundred francs!" said Mercedes, "are you thinking of that, Albert?
106.158 --Oh! as to that point, I have made inquiries at the stagecoaches and steamboats, and my calculations are made.
106.159 "You keep your seats for Chalon, in the coupé: you see, my mother, that I treat you like a queen, thirty-five francs."
106.160 Albert took a pen, and wrote:
106.161 Coupe, thirty-five francs, ci:...................................... 35 F From Chalon to Lyon, you go by steamboat, six francs, ci: 6 F From Lyon to Avignon, the steamboat again, sixteen francs, ci:..... 16 F From Avignon to Marseille, seven francs, ci:.............................  7 F Road expenses, fifty francs, ci:............................ 50 F TOTAL:..............................................................114 F
106.162 "Let's put a hundred and twenty," added Albert, smiling, "you see that I am generous, don't you, my mother?
106.163 -But you, my poor child?
106.164 -Me! haven't you seen that I'm saving eighty francs?
106.165 "A young man, my mother, does not need all his comfort; besides, I know what it is to travel.
106.166 --With your post-chair and your valet.
106.167 --Well, anyway, my mother.
106.168 --Well, so be it, said Mercedes; but those two hundred francs?
106.169 --There are the two hundred francs, and then two hundred more.
106.170 "Here, I sold my watch for one hundred francs, and the charms for three hundred.
106.171 "How fortunate! Charms that were worth three times the watch. Always this famous story of the superfluous!
106.172 "So here we are, rich, since instead of the one hundred and fourteen francs you needed to make your way, you have two hundred and fifty.
106.173 --But we owe something in this hotel?
106.174 --Thirty francs, but I pay them out of my hundred and fifty francs.
106.175 "That is agreed; and since I only need eighty francs to make my way, you see that I am swimming in luxury.
106.176 "But that is not all.
106.177 "What do you say to this, mother?"
106.178 And Albert drew from a small notebook with a gold clasp, a remnant of his old fantasies or perhaps even a tender memory of one of those mysterious, veiled women who knocked at the little door, Albert drew from a small notebook a thousand-franc bill.
106.179 "What is this?" asked Mercedes.
106.180 --A thousand francs, mother. Oh, it is perfectly square.
106.181 --But where did you get these thousand francs?
106.182 -Listen to this, mother, and don't get too excited."
106.183 And Albert, rising, went and kissed his mother on both cheeks, and then stopped to look at her.
106.184 "You have no idea, my mother, how beautiful I find you!" said the young man with a deep feeling of filial love, "you are in truth the most beautiful as you are the noblest woman I have ever seen!
106.185 --Dear child, said Mercedes trying in vain to hold back a tear that was pointing at the corner of her eyelid.
106.186 --In truth, you only needed to be unhappy to change my love into adoration.
106.187 --I am not unhappy as long as I have my son, said Mercedes; I will not be unhappy as long as I have him.
106.188 --Ah, that's right, said Albert; but this is where the test begins, my mother: you know what is agreed!
106.189 -Did we agree on something? asked Mercedes.
106.190 --Yes, it is agreed that you will live in Marseilles, and that I will leave for Africa, where, in place of the name I have left, I will make the name I have taken."
106.191 Mercedes heaved a sigh.
106.192 "Well, my mother, since yesterday I have been engaged in the spahis," added the young man, lowering his eyes with some shame, for he himself did not know how sublime his abasement was; "or rather I thought that my body was mine and that I could sell it; since yesterday I have been replacing someone.
106.193 "I sold myself, as they say, and," he added, trying to smile, "for more than I thought I was worth, that is, two thousand francs.
106.194 -So these thousand francs?... said Mercedes, flinching.
106.195 --That is half the sum, my mother; the other will come in a year."
106.196 Mercedes raised her eyes to heaven with an expression that nothing could render, and the two tears arrested at the corner of her eyelid, overflowing under the inner emotion, ran silently down her cheeks.
106.197 "The price of his blood!" she murmured.
106.198 --Yes, if I am killed," laughed Morcerf, "but I assure you, good mother, that I am, on the contrary, intent on cruelly defending my skin; I never felt so good to live as now.
106.199 -My God! my God!" said Mercedes.
106.200 -And why do you want me to be killed, mother?
106.201 "Has Lamoriciere, that other Ney of the South, been killed?
106.202 "Was Changarnier killed?
106.203 "Was Bedeau killed?
106.204 "Was Morrel, whom we know, killed?
106.205 "Think of your joy, my mother, when you see me return with my embroidered uniform!
106.206 "I declare to you that I intend to be superb underneath, and that I chose this regiment by coquetry."
106.207 Mercédès sighed, while trying to smile; she understood, this holy mother, that it was wrong of her to let her child carry all the weight of the sacrifice.
106.208 "Well, then!" said Albert, "you understand, my mother, there are already more than four thousand francs assured for you: with these four thousand francs you will live two good years.
106.209 "Do you think so?" said Mercedes.
106.210 These words had escaped the Countess, and with such true sorrow that their true meaning did not escape Albert; he felt his heart clench, and, taking his mother's hand, he pressed it tenderly in his own:
106.211 "Yes, you will live!" he said.
106.212 --I will live!" cried Mercedes, "but you won't leave, will you, my son?
106.213 --My mother, I will go, said Albert in a calm and firm voice, you love me too much to leave me idle and useless near you; besides I have signed.
106.214 -You will do according to your will, my son; I will do according to God's.
106.215 --Not according to my will, my mother, but according to reason, according to necessity. We are two desperate creatures, aren't we? What is life for you today? What is life for me? Oh, very little without you, my mother, believe it; for without you this life, I swear to you, would have ceased the day I doubted my father and denied his name! Finally, I live, if you promise me to hope again; if you leave me the care of your happiness to come, you double my strength. Then I go to find the governor of Algeria there, he is a loyal heart and above all a soldier; I tell him my gloomy story: I beg him to turn his eyes from time to time to the side where I will be, and if he keeps his word, if he watches me do it, before six months I am an officer or dead. If I am an officer, your fate is assured, my mother, for I will have money for you and for myself, and a new name of which we will both be proud, since it will be your real name. If I am killed... well, if I am killed, then, dear mother, you will die, if you please, and then our misfortunes will have their end in their very excess.
106.216 -That's good, answered Mercedes with her noble and eloquent look; you are right, my son: let's prove to some people who look at us and wait for our deeds to judge us, let's prove to them that we are at least worthy of pity.
106.217 --But no dismal ideas, dear mother! cried the young man; I swear to you that we are, or at least that we can be, very happy. You are at once a woman of spirit and resignation; I have become simple in taste and without passion, I hope. Once in service, I am rich; once in the house of Mr. Dantes, you are at ease. Let us try! I beg you, my mother, let us try.
106.218 --Yes, let us try, my son, for you must live, for you must be happy," replied Mercedes.
106.219 -So, my mother, this is our division, added the young man, affecting great ease. We can leave this very day. Come on, I'll take your place, as it is said.
106.220 - But yours, my son?
106.221 - I must stay two or three days more, mother; it is the beginning of a separation, and we need to get used to it. I need some recommendations, some information about Africa, and I will join you in Marseilles.
106.222 --Well, let's go!" said Mercedes, wrapping herself in the only shawl she had brought with her, which happened to be a very expensive black cashmere; "let's go!
106.223 Albert hastily gathered up his papers, rang the bell to pay the thirty francs he owed the master of the hotel, and, offering his arm to his mother, went down the stairs.
106.224 Someone was coming down in front of them; this someone, hearing the rustle of a silk dress on the banister, turned around.
106.225 "Debray!" murmured Albert.
106.226 -- "You, Morcerf!" replied the minister's secretary, stopping on the step where he was.
106.227 Curiosity prevailed in Debray over the desire to remain incognito; besides, he was recognized.
106.228 It seemed piquant, indeed, to find in this unknown hotel the young man whose unfortunate adventure had just made such a great splash in Paris.
106.229 "Morcerf!" repeated Debray.
106.230 Then, catching sight in the half-darkness of the still young face and the black veil of Mme. de Morcerf, he said
106.231 "Oh! pardon," he added with a smile, "I leave you, Albert."
106.232 Albert understood Debray's thought.
106.233 "My mother," he said, turning back to Mercédès, "this is M. Debray, secretary to the Minister of the Interior, an old friend of mine.
106.234 "What do you mean, old friend?" stammered Debray.
106.235 -- I say that, Mr. Debray," resumed Albert, "because today I have no more friends, and I must have none. I thank you very much for having recognized me, sir."
106.236 Debray went up two steps and came to give his interlocutor an energetic handshake.
106.237 "Believe, my dear Albert," he said with the emotion he was likely to have, "believe that I have taken a deep part in the misfortune which has befallen you, and that, for all things, I place myself at your disposal.
106.238 --Thank you, sir," said Albert, smiling, "but in the midst of this misfortune we have remained rich enough to have no need of recourse to anyone; we are leaving Paris, and, our journey paid for, we have five thousand francs left."
106.239 The red rose to Debray's forehead, who held a million in his wallet; and however unpoetic this exact spirit was, he could not help reflecting that the same house had once contained two women, one of whom, justly dishonored, was going away poor with fifteen hundred thousand francs under the fold of her coat, and the other of whom, unjustly struck down, but sublime in her misfortune, was rich with a few deniers.
106.240 This parallel baffled his combinations of politeness, the philosophy of the example crushed him; he stammered a few words of general civility and went downstairs quickly.
106.241 That day the clerks of the department, his subordinates, had much to suffer from his chagrin.
106.242 But in the evening he bought a very beautiful house, located on the Boulevard de la Madeleine, and bringing in fifty thousand pounds of income.
106.243 The next day, at the hour when Debray signed the deed, that is to say, at five o'clock in the evening, Mme de Morcerf, after having tenderly embraced her son and after having been tenderly embraced by him, climbed into the coach, which closed on her.
106.244 A man was hidden in the courtyard of the Laffitte messenger's office behind one of those arched entresol windows which surmount every office; he saw Mercedes get into the carriage; he saw the coach leave; he saw Albert drive away.
106.245 Then he passed his hand over his doubt-laden forehead, saying:
106.246 "Alas! by what means shall I restore to these two innocents the happiness I have taken from them? God will help me."
107.000 The Lion's Den.
107.001 One of the quarters of the Force, that which contains the most compromised and dangerous prisoners, is called the Saint-Bernard court.
107.002 The prisoners, in their energetic language, have nicknamed it the Lion's Den, probably because the captives have teeth that often bite the bars and sometimes the guards.
107.003 It is in the prison a prison; the walls have a double thickness of the others. Every day a teller carefully probes the massive gates, and one recognizes from the Herculean stature, from the cold and incisive looks of these guards, that they have been chosen to rule their people by terror and the activity of intelligence.
107.004 The courtyard of this district is framed in enormous walls on which the sun slides obliquely when it decides to penetrate in this abyss of moral and physical uglinesses. It is there, on the pavement, that since the hour of the rise wander worried, haggard, pale, like shadows, the men whom justice holds curved under the knife that it sharpens.
107.005 One sees them sticking, crouching, along the wall that absorbs and retains the most heat. They remain there, talking two by two, more often isolated, the eye unceasingly attracted towards the door which opens to call one of the inhabitants of this gloomy stay, or to vomit in the abyss a new slag rejected from the crucible of the society.
107.006 The Saint-Bernard court has its particular parlor; it is a long square, divided into two parts by two parallel gates planted at three feet one of the other, so that the visitor cannot shake the hand of the prisoner or pass him something. This parlor is dark, damp, and in every way horrible, especially when one thinks of the dreadful confidences that have slipped over these grilles and rusted the iron bars.
107.007 However, this place, as awful as it is, is the paradise where those men whose days are numbered come to retreat into a hoped-for, savored society: it is so rare that one leaves the Lion's Den to go anywhere but to the Saint-Jacques barrier, to the prison or to the solitary confinement!
107.008 In this courtyard, which we have just described and which was sweating with a cold dampness, a young man walked about, his hands in the pockets of his habit, and was regarded with great curiosity by the inhabitants of the Fosse.
107.009 He would have passed for an elegant man, thanks to the cut of his clothes, if they had not been in tatters; however, they had not been worn out: the cloth, fine and silky in the untouched places, easily regained its luster under the caressing hand of the prisoner who was trying to make a new suit of it.
107.010 He applied the same care to close a batiste shirt that had changed color considerably since he had entered prison, and on his varnished boots passed the corner of a handkerchief embroidered with initials surmounted by a heraldic crown.
107.011 Some of the residents of the Lion's Den were interested in the prisoner's search for a toilet.
107.012 "Well, here's the prince looking good," said one of the robbers.
107.013 --He is very handsome, of course," said another, "and if he only had a comb and some ointment, he would outshine all the white-gloved gentlemen.
107.014 --His suit must have been quite new and his boots shine beautifully. It is flattering for us that there are fellow-members so properly; and these brigands of gendarmes are quite vile. The envious ones! to have torn a toilet like that!
107.015 --It seems that he is a famous one, says another; he has done everything... and in the great genre... He comes from there so young! oh, it's superb!"
107.016 And the object of this hideous admiration seemed to savor the praise or the vapor of the praise, for he did not hear the words.
107.017 His toilet finished, he approached the canteen window against which a guard leaned:
107.018 "Let's see, sir," he said to him, "lend me twenty francs, you'll soon have them; with me, no risks to run. Think, then, that I have relatives who have more millions than you have money... Let's see, twenty francs, and I beg you, so that I take a pistol and buy a robe. I suffer horribly to be always in a suit and boots. What a suit!" he said, "for a Prince Cavalcanti!
107.019 The guard turned his back on him and shrugged his shoulders. He did not laugh even at these words which would have relaxed all the foreheads because this man had heard many others, or rather he had always heard the same thing.
107.020 "Go," said Andrea, "you are a man without entrails, and I will make you lose your place."
107.021 This word made the guard turn around, who this time let out a loud laugh.
107.022 Then the prisoners approached and made a circle.
107.023 "I tell you," continued Andrea, "that with this miserable sum I will be able to get a suit of clothes and a room, in order to receive in a decent way the illustrious visit that I expect any day now.
107.024 -- He is right! he is right! said the prisoners... By Jove, you can see that he's a good man.
107.025 -- Well, lend him the twenty francs, said the guard, leaning on his other colossal shoulder; don't you owe that to a comrade?
107.026 --I am not the comrade of these people, said the young man proudly; do not insult me, you have no such right."
107.027 The thieves looked at each other with dull murmurs, and a storm raised by the guard's provocation, even more than by Andrea's words, began to rumble over the aristocratic prisoner.
107.028 The guard, sure to make the _quos ego_ when the waves were too tumultuous, let them rise little by little to play a trick on the importunate solicitor, and give himself a recreation during the long watch of his day.
107.029 Already the thieves approached Andrea; some said to each other:
107.030 "The savate! the savate!"
107.031 Cruel operation which consists in beating, not with a savate, but with a shoe, a fellow-member fallen into the disgrace of these gentlemen.
107.032 Others proposed the eel; another kind of recreation consisting of filling a twisted handkerchief with sand, pebbles, and large sums of money, when they had any, which the executioners unloaded like a flail on the shoulders and head of the patient.
107.033 "Let us whip the handsome gentleman," said some, "the honest gentleman!"
107.034 But Andrea, turning toward them, winked, swelled his cheek with his tongue, and made that smacking of the lips which is equivalent to a thousand signs of intelligence among bandits reduced to silence.
107.035 It was a Masonic sign that Caderousse had indicated to him.
107.036 They recognized one of their own.
107.037 Immediately the handkerchiefs fell back; the iron cloak returned to the foot of the principal executioner. A few voices were heard proclaiming that the gentleman was right, that the gentleman could be as honest as he liked, and that the prisoners wanted to set an example of freedom of conscience.
107.038 The riot receded. The guard was so amazed by this that he immediately took Andrea by the hands and began to search him, attributing this sudden change of the inhabitants of the Lion's Den to some manifestations more significant than fascination.
107.039 Andrea let himself make, not without protesting.
107.040 Suddenly a voice rang out at the counter.
107.041 "Benedetto!" shouted an inspector.
107.042 The guard let go of his prey.
107.043 "They're calling me?" said Andrea.
107.044 --To the parlor!" said the voice.
107.045 --You see, I am being visited. Ah! my dear sir, you will see if one can treat a Cavalcanti like an ordinary man!"
107.046 And Andrea, slipping into the courtyard like a black shadow, rushed through the ajar wicket, leaving his confreres and the guard himself in admiration.
107.047 He was indeed being called to the parlor, and one should not be less amazed than Andrea himself; for the shrewd young man, since his entry into the Force, instead of using, like the common people of this benefit of writing to be claimed, had kept the most stoic silence.
107.048 "I am," he said, "obviously protected by someone powerful; everything proves it to me; this sudden fortune, this ease with which I have overcome all obstacles, an improvised family, an illustrious name that has become my property, gold raining down on me, the most magnificent alliances promised to my ambition. An unfortunate oversight of my fortune, an absence of my protector has lost me, yes, but not absolutely, not forever! The hand has withdrawn for a moment, it must reach out to me and seize me again at the moment when I believe myself ready to fall into the abyss.
107.049 "Why should I risk an imprudent step? I might alienate the protector! There are two ways for him to get me out of trouble: the mysterious escape, bought at a high price, and the forced hand to the judges to obtain an absolution. Let us wait to speak, to act that it is proved to me that I have been totally abandoned, and then..."
107.050 Andrea had constructed a plan that one can believe to be clever; the wretch was fearless in attack and tough in defense.
107.051 The misery of the common prison, the privations of all kinds, he had supported them. However little by little the naturalness, or rather the habit, had taken again the top. Andrea suffered from being naked, from being dirty, from being hungry; the time lasted him.
107.052 It was at this moment of boredom that the voice of the inspector called him to the visiting room.
107.053 Andrea felt her heart leap with joy. It was too early for it to be a visit from the examining magistrate, and too late for it to be a call from the prison warden or the doctor; so it was the unexpected visit.
107.054 Behind the grate of the parlor where Andrea was introduced, he saw, with his eyes dilated by an avid curiosity, the dark and intelligent figure of Mr. Bertuccio, who was also looking, him, with a painful astonishment, at the grates, the locked doors, and the shadow that was agitating behind the intertwined bars.
107.055 "Ah!" said Andrea, touched to the heart.
107.056 --Hello, Benedetto, said Bertuccio in his hollow, sonorous voice.
107.057 --You! said the young man, looking around him with fear.
107.058 --You don't recognize me, said Bertuccio, unhappy child!
107.059 --Silence, but silence then! said Andrea, who knew the acute hearing of these walls; my God, my God, do not speak so loudly!
107.060 -You would like to talk with me, wouldn't you, said Bertuccio, alone?
107.061 --Oh, yes," said Andrea.
107.062 --That's fine."
107.063 And Bertuccio, rummaging in his pocket, signaled to a guard who could be seen behind the window of the wicket.
107.064 "Read," he said.
107.065 --What is this?" said Andrea.
107.066 --The order to take you to a room, to settle you down and to let me communicate with you.
107.067 --Oh!" said Andrea, jumping with joy.
107.068 And at once, folding up in himself, he said to himself:
107.069 "Still the unknown protector! I am not forgotten! They are looking for secrecy, since they want to talk in an isolated room. I hold them... Bertuccio has been sent by the protector!"
107.070 The guard conferred for a moment with a superior, then opened the two grated doors and led to a room on the second floor overlooking the courtyard Andrea, who no longer felt joy.
107.071 The room was whitewashed, as is the custom in prisons. It had an aspect of cheerfulness which appeared radiant to the prisoner: a stove, a bed, a chair, a table formed the sumptuous furnishing of it.
107.072 Bertuccio sat down on the chair. Andrea threw himself on the bed. The guard withdrew.
107.073 "Let's see," said the intendant, "what do you have to say to me?
107.074 --And you?" said Andrea.
107.075 --But first speak...
107.076 --Oh, no; it is you who have taught me a lot, since you have come to find me.
107.077 -- Well, so be it. You have continued your course of villainy: you have stolen, you have murdered.
107.078 -Well, if you're going to take me to a private room to tell me these things, you might as well not have bothered. I know all these things. There are others that I don't know, on the contrary. Let's talk about those, please. Who sent you?
107.079 -- Oh, oh, you're going fast, Mr. Benedetto.
107.080 -- Right? And to the point. Let's spare no unnecessary words. Who sent you?
107.081 --Person.
107.082 --How do you know that I am in prison?
107.083 --I recognized you a long time ago in the insolent fashionable who was so gracefully pushing a horse on the Champs-Élysées.
107.084 --The Champs-Élysées!... Ah! ah! we are burning, as they say in the game of tweezers... The Champs-Élysées... Let's talk a little about my father, shall we?
107.085 --What am I?
107.086 -- You, my good man, are my adoptive father... But it was not you, I imagine, who disposed of a hundred thousand francs in my favor, which I devoured in four or five months; it was not you who forged for me an Italian and gentleman father; It was not you who got me into the world and invited me to a certain dinner that I think I still eat, at Auteuil, with the best company in all of Paris, with a certain king's prosecutor whose acquaintance I was quite wrong not to cultivate, which would be so useful to me at this time; it was not you, finally, who guaranteed me for one or two millions when the fatal accident of the discovery of the pot aux roses happened to me. .. Come, speak, esteemed Corsican, speak...
107.087 -- What do you want me to say?
107.088 -- I will help you.
107.089 "You were talking about the Champs-Élysées just now, my worthy foster father.
107.090 --Well?
107.091 --Well, in the Champs-Élysées lives a very rich gentleman, very rich.
107.092 --Who you robbed and murdered, didn't you?
107.093 --I think so.
107.094 --Mr. Count of Monte Cristo?
107.095 -You named him, as M. Racine says. Well, shall I throw myself into his arms, strangle him over my heart and cry out, "My father! my father!" as M. Pixérécourt says?
107.096 -- "Let us not joke," replied Bertuccio gravely, "and let no such name be pronounced here as you dare to pronounce it.
107.097 --Bah!" said Andrea, a little stunned by the solemnity of Bertuccio's demeanor, "why not?
107.098 --Because he who bears that name is too favored by heaven to be the father of a wretch like you.
107.099 --Oh, big words...
107.100 --And great effects if you are not careful!
107.101 --Threats!... I do not fear them... I will say...
107.102 --Do you think you are dealing with pygmies of your kind? said Bertuccio in a tone so calm and with a look so assured that Andrea was stirred to the depths of his entrails; do you think you are dealing with your routine villains of the prison, or with your naive fools of the world?... Benedetto, you are in a terrible hand, this hand is willing to open for you: take advantage of it. Don't play with the lightning that it puts down for a moment, but that it can take back if you try to disturb it in its free movement.
107.103 -My father... I want to know who my father is! says the stubborn one; I will die if I have to, but I will know. What does scandal do for me? reputation... advertisements... as Beauchamp the journalist says. But you people of the big world always have something to lose in scandal, despite your millions and your coats of arms... Now, who is my father?
107.104 --I came to tell you.
107.105 --Ah!" cried Benedetto, his eyes sparkling with joy.
107.106 At this moment the door opened, and the teller, addressing Bertuccio
107.107 "Pardon, sir," he said, "but the examining magistrate is waiting for the prisoner.
107.108 "This is the end of my interrogation," said Andrea to the worthy steward... To hell with the intruder!
107.109 --I will return tomorrow, said Bertuccio.
107.110 -Good! said Andrea. Gentlemen gendarmes, I am all yours... Ah, dear sir, leave a dozen écus at the clerk's office so that they can give me what I need here.
107.111 --That will be done", replied Bertuccio.
107.112 Andrea held out her hand, Bertuccio kept his in his pocket, and only rang a few silver coins in it.
107.113 "It is what I wanted to say," made Andrea grimacing a smile, but quite subdued by the strange calmness of Bertuccio.
107.114 "Would I be mistaken?" he said to himself as he climbed into the oblong, toasted carriage called the "salad basket. We shall see! So, see you tomorrow!" he added, turning to Bertuccio.
107.115 -- "To-morrow!" replied the steward.
108.000 The judge.
108.001 It will be remembered that the Abbot Busoni had remained alone with Noirtier in the mortuary room, and that it was the old man and the priest who had constituted themselves the guardians of the girl's body.
108.002 Perhaps the abbot's Christian exhortations, perhaps his gentle charity, perhaps his persuasive words had restored the old man's courage, for from the moment he had been able to confer with the priest, instead of the despair that had first seized him, everything about Noirtier announced a great resignation, a calm that was quite surprising to all who remembered the deep affection he had for Valentine.
108.003 M. de Villefort had not seen the old man since the morning of his death. The whole house had been renewed: another valet had been engaged for him, another servant for Noirtier; two women had entered the service of Mme. de Villefort: all, even the concierge and the coachman, offered new faces which had stood, as it were, between the different masters of this accursed house and had intercepted the already rather cold relations which existed between them. Besides, the trial was to begin in three days, and Villefort, locked up in his chambers, was pursuing with feverish activity the proceedings begun against Caderousse's murderer. This affair, like all those in which the Count of Monte Cristo was involved, had caused a great stir in the Parisian world. The evidence was not convincing, since it was based on a few words written by a dying convict, a former companion of the accused, who could accuse his companion out of hatred or revenge: the magistrate's conscience alone had been formed; the king's prosecutor had ended up giving himself this terrible conviction that Benedetto was guilty, and he had to derive from this difficult victory one of those pleasures of self-love which alone awakened a little the fibers of his frozen heart.
108.004 The trial was thus going on, thanks to the incessant work of Villefort, who wanted to make it the beginning of the next trials; so he had been forced to hide himself more than ever to avoid answering the prodigious number of requests that were addressed to him to obtain court tickets.
108.005 And then so little time had passed since poor Valentine had been laid in the grave, the grief of the house was still so recent, that no one was surprised to see the father so sternly absorbed in his duty, that is, in the only distraction he could find to his grief.
108.006 Only once, it was the day after Benedetto had received that second visit from Bertuccio, in which the latter had had to name his father, the day after that day, which was Sunday, only once, shall we say, had Villefort caught sight of his father: it was at a moment when the magistrate, exhausted with fatigue, had gone down into the garden of his hotel, and sombre, bent under an implacable thought, like Tarquin felling with his badine the heads of the highest poppies, M. de Villefort cut down with his cane the long, dying stems of the hollyhocks that stood along the paths like the spectres of those flowers so brilliant in the season that had just passed.
108.007 More than once he had already touched the bottom of the garden, that is to say that famous gate giving on to the abandoned enclosure, always returning by the same alley, resuming his walk with the same step and with the same gesture, when his eyes went mechanically towards the house, in which he heard his son playing noisily, returned from the boarding school to spend Sunday and Monday near his mother.
108.008 At that moment he saw at one of the open windows Mr. Noirtier, who had rolled himself in his armchair to that window, to enjoy the last rays of a still warm sun which came to greet the dying flowers of the volubilis and the reddened leaves of the virgin vines which lined the balcony.
108.009 The old man's eye was riveted, so to speak, on a point that Villefort could only imperfectly see. This look of Noirtier's was so hateful, so savage, so ardent with impatience, that the king's prosecutor, skilled in grasping all the impressions of this face which he knew so well, moved away from the line he was walking to see on which person this heavy gaze fell.
108.010 Then he saw, under a clump of lime trees with their branches already almost bare, Mme de Villefort sitting with a book in her hand, interrupting her reading from time to time to smile at her son or to send him back the elastic ball he was stubbornly throwing from the salon into the garden.
108.011 Villefort paled, for he understood what the old man wanted.
108.012 Noirtier was still looking at the same object; but suddenly his gaze shifted from the wife to the husband, and it was Villefort himself who had to endure the attack of those dazzling eyes which, in changing their object, had also changed their language, without, however, losing any of their threatening expression.
108.013 Mme. de Villefort, a stranger to all these passions whose crossfire passed over her head, was at this moment holding back her son's ball, beckoning him to come and fetch it with a kiss; but Edouard begged for a long time; the maternal caress probably did not seem to him a sufficient reward for the trouble he was about to take. At last he made up his mind, jumped out of the window in the midst of a bed of heliotropes and daisies, and ran to Mme de Villefort with a sweaty brow. Mme de Villefort wiped her forehead, put her lips on that moist ivory, and sent the child away with her ball in one hand and a handful of sweets in the other.
108.014 Villefort, drawn by an invisible attraction, as a bird is drawn by a snake, Villefort approached the house; as he drew nearer, Noirtier's gaze lowered as he followed him, and the fire in his eyes seemed to take on such a degree of incandescence, that Villefort felt himself devoured by it to the bottom of his heart. Indeed, one could read in this look a bloody reproach at the same time as a terrible threat. Then Noirtier's eyelids and eyes rose to heaven as if he were reminding his son of a forgotten oath.
108.015 "It's all right, sir," replied Villefort at the bottom of the court, "it's all right! Have patience for one more day; what I have said is said."
108.016 Noirtier seemed calmed by these words, and his eyes turned indifferently to another side.
108.017 Villefort violently unbuttoned his frock coat, which was choking him, passed a livid hand over his forehead, and went back into his office.
108.018 The night passed cold and quiet; everyone went to bed and slept as usual in this house. Alone, as usual, Villefort did not go to bed at the same time as the others, and worked until five o'clock in the morning to review the last interrogations made the day before by the investigating magistrates, to compile the depositions of the witnesses and to clarify his indictment, one of the most energetic and skilfully conceived that he had ever drawn up.
108.019 The next day, Monday, the first session of the trial was to take place. That day, Villefort saw it dawn pale and sinister, and its bluish glow made the lines drawn in red ink glow on the paper. The magistrate had fallen asleep for a moment while his lamp was breathing its last: he awoke to its flickering, his fingers moist and flushed as if he had dipped them in blood.
108.020 He opened his window: a great band of orange crossed the sky in the distance and cut in two the thin poplars that were profiled in black on the horizon. In the field of alfalfa, beyond the gate of the chestnut trees, a lark was climbing to the sky, making its clear and morning song.
108.021 The humid air of dawn flooded Villefort's head and refreshed his memory.
108.022 "It will be for today," he said with effort; "today the man who is to hold the sword of justice must strike wherever the guilty are."
108.023 His eyes then went in spite of himself to seek the window of Noirtier who was advancing in return, the window where he had seen the old man the day before.
108.024 The curtain was drawn.
108.025 And yet the image of his father was so present to him that he addressed that closed window as if it were open, and through that opening he still saw the threatening old man.
108.026 "Yes," he murmured, "yes, be quiet!"
108.027 His head fell back on his chest, and, with his head thus bowed, he made a few turns in his study, and then at last he threw himself fully clothed on a sofa, less to sleep than to soften his limbs stiffened by fatigue and the cold of the work that penetrates to the marrow of the bones.
108.028 Little by little everyone woke up. Villefort, from his study, heard the successive noises which constitute, so to speak, the life of the house: the doors set in motion, the ringing of Mme de Villefort's bell calling her maid, the first cries of the child, who was getting up joyfully as one usually does at that age.
108.029 Villefort rang the bell in turn. His new valet entered his house and brought him the newspapers.
108.030 Along with the newspapers, he brought a cup of chocolate.
108.031 "What have you brought me?" asked Villefort.
108.032 --A cup of chocolate.
108.033 --I didn't ask for it. Who is taking care of me?
108.034 --Madame; she told me that monsieur would no doubt talk a lot today in this matter of assassination and that he needed to gain strength."
108.035 And the valet placed on the table set up near the sofa, a table, like all the others, loaded with papers, the vermeil cup.
108.036 The valet left.
108.037 Villefort looked at the cup gloomily for a moment, then suddenly took it with a nervous movement and swallowed the drink in one gulp. It seemed as if he hoped that the drink was lethal, and that it was calling for death to deliver him from a duty that required something far more difficult than dying. Then he got up and walked around his study with a kind of smile that would have been terrible to see if anyone had looked at him.
108.038 The chocolate was harmless, and M. de Villefort felt nothing.
108.039 When lunchtime arrived, M. de Villefort did not appear at the table. The valet went into the study.
108.040 "Madame has sent word to the gentleman," he said, "that eleven o'clock has just sounded and that the hearing is at noon.
108.041 --Well, said Villefort, afterwards?
108.042 --Madame has made her toilet: she is all ready, and asks if she will accompany monsieur?
108.043 --Where?
108.044 --The Palace.
108.045 --For what purpose?
108.046 --Madam says she very much wants to attend this session.
108.047 --Ah!" said Villefort with an almost frightening accent, "she desires that!
108.048 The servant took a step back and said:
108.049 "If monsieur wishes to go out alone, I will tell madame."
108.050 Villefort remained silent for a moment; he dug his pale cheek with his fingernails, on which his ebony-black beard was slicing.
108.051 "Tell madame," he answered at last, "that I wish to speak to her, and that I beg her to wait for me at her house.
108.052 --Yes, sir.
108.053 --Then come back and shave and dress me.
108.054 --At once."
108.055 The valet disappeared indeed to reappear, shaved Villefort and solemnly dressed him in black.
108.056 Then when he had finished
108.057 "Madame said she would wait for monsieur as soon as his toilet was finished," he said.
108.058 --I'll go."
108.059 And Villefort, with his files under his arm and his hat in his hand, went toward his wife's apartment.
108.060 At the door he stopped for a moment and wiped with his handkerchief the sweat that ran down his livid forehead.
108.061 Then he pushed open the door.
108.062 Mme de Villefort was sitting on an ottoman, impatiently leafing through newspapers and pamphlets that young Edward was amusing himself by tearing to pieces before his mother had even had time to finish reading them. She was fully dressed to go out; her hat was waiting for her on an armchair; she had put on her gloves.
108.063 "Ah! here you are, sir," she said in her natural, calm voice; "my God! are you quite pale, sir! Have you been working all night again? Why didn't you come to lunch with us? Well, will you take me, or shall I go alone with Edward?"
108.064 Mme. de Villefort had, as we see, multiplied her requests for an answer; but to all these requests M. de Villefort had remained cold and mute as a statue.
108.065 "Edouard," said Villefort, fixing an imperious look on the child, "go and play in the drawing-room, my friend; I must speak to your mother."
108.066 Mme. de Villefort, seeing this cold countenance, this resolute tone, these strange preliminary preparations, flinched.
108.067 Édouard had raised his head, had looked at his mother, then, seeing that she did not confirm M. de Villefort's order, he had gone back to cutting off the heads of his lead soldiers.
108.068 "Edward!" cried M. de Villefort so roughly that the child leaped to the carpet, "can you hear me?
108.069 The child, to whom this treatment was unaccustomed, jumped to his feet and turned pale; it would have been difficult to tell whether it was from anger or from fear.
108.070 His father went to him, took him by the arm, and kissed him on the forehead.
108.071 "Go," he said, "my child, go!"
108.072 Edward went out.
108.073 M. de Villefort went to the door and locked it behind him.
108.074 "O my God!" said the young woman, looking at her husband to the depths of her soul and smiling a smile that chilled Villefort's impassivity, "what is it?
108.075 --Madame, where do you put the poison you usually use?" articulated the magistrate, placed between his wife and the door, clearly and without preamble.
108.076 Mme de Villefort felt what a lark must feel when it sees the kite tightening its murderous circles over its head.
108.077 A hoarse, broken sound, which was neither a cry nor a sigh, escaped from Mme de Villefort's chest, which paled to lividity.
108.078 "Monsieur," she said, "I... I don't understand."
108.079 And as she had risen in a paroxysm of terror, in a second paroxysm stronger no doubt than the first, she let herself fall back on the cushions of the sofa.
108.080 "I was asking you," continued Villefort in a perfectly calm voice, "where you hid the poison with which you killed my father-in-law M. de Saint-Méran, my mother-in-law, Barrois and my daughter Valentine.
108.081 - "Ah, monsieur," cried Mme. de Villefort, clasping her hands together, "what are you saying?
108.082 -It is not for you to question me, but to answer.
108.083 -- Is it to the husband or to the judge?" stammered Mme de Villefort.
108.084 --The judge, madame! the judge!
108.085 It was a frightening sight to see the pallor of this woman, the anguish in her eyes, the trembling of her whole body.
108.086 "Ah, sir!" she murmured, "ah, sir!
108.087 -- "You do not answer, madam!" cried the terrible interrogator.
108.088 Then he added, with a smile even more frightening than his anger:
108.089 "It is true that you do not deny!"
108.090 She made a movement.
108.091 "And you could not deny it," added Villefort, extending his hand towards her as if to seize it in the name of justice; "you have accomplished these various crimes with impudent skill, but which nevertheless could only deceive people disposed by their affection to be blind to your account. As soon as Mme de Saint-Méran died, I knew that there was a poisoner in my house: M. d'Avrigny had warned me of it; after Barrois' death, God forgive me! my suspicions fell on someone, on an angel! my suspicions which, even where there is no crime, watch unceasingly lighted in the depths of my heart; but after Valentine's death there was no longer any doubt for me, madame, and not only for me, but also for others; thus your crime, known to two people now, suspected by several, is going to become public; and, as I told you just now, madame, it is no longer a husband who is speaking to you, it is a judge!"
108.092 The young woman hid her face in both hands.
108.093 "Oh sir!" she stammered, "I beg you, do not believe appearances!
108.094 -Are you a coward?" cried Villefort in a scornful voice. I have always noticed that poisoners are cowards. Would you be a coward, you who had the terrible courage to see two old men and a young girl murdered in front of you?
108.095 -Sir! Sir!
108.096 -Would you be a coward, continued Villefort with increasing exaltation, you who have counted the minutes of four agonies one by one, you who have combined your infernal plans and stirred your infamous drinks with such miraculous skill and precision? You who have combined everything so well, have you forgotten to calculate one thing, that is, where the revelation of your crimes could lead you? Oh, that is impossible, and you have kept some poison sweeter, more subtle and more deadly than the others to escape the punishment that was due you... You have done this, I hope, at least?"
108.097 Mme de Villefort wrung her hands and fell to her knees.
108.098 "I know well... I know well," he said, "you confess; but the confession made to judges, the confession made at the last moment, the confession made when one can no longer deny, this confession in no way diminishes the punishment they inflict on the guilty.
108.099 - "Punishment!" cried Mme de Villefort, "punishment!" Sir, you have said that word twice now?
108.100 - No doubt. Is it because you were four times guilty that you thought you could escape it? Is it because you are the wife of the one who demands this punishment that you thought that this punishment would go away? No, Madam, no! Whatever it may be, the scaffold awaits the poisoner, if above all, as I told you just now, the poisoner has not had the care to preserve for herself a few drops of her most certain poison."
108.101 Mme. de Villefort uttered a wild cry, and hideous, indomitable terror invaded her decomposed features.
108.102 "Oh, do not fear the scaffold, madame," said the magistrate, "I do not wish to dishonor you, for that would be to dishonor myself; no, on the contrary, if you have heard me well, you must understand that you cannot die on the scaffold.
108.103 -- No, I didn't understand; what do you mean?
108.104 --I mean that the wife of the first magistrate of the capital will not burden with her infamy a name that has remained without stain, and will not dishonor her husband and child at the same time.
108.105 --No! oh, no.
108.106 -- Well, madam, it will be a good deed on your part, and for this good deed I thank you.
108.107 --You thank me! and for what?
108.108 --For what you have just said.
108.109 --What did I say! I've lost my head; I don't understand anything anymore, my God! my God!"
108.110 And she got up with her hair spread out, her lips foaming.
108.111 "You have answered, madam, the question I asked you when you came in here: Where is the poison you usually use, madame?"
108.112 Mme. de Villefort raised her arms to heaven and clasped her hands together convulsively.
108.113 "No, no," she shouted, "no, you don't want that!
108.114 --What I don't want, madam, is for you to perish on a scaffold, do you hear?
108.115 --Oh, sir, mercy!
108.116 -What I want is that justice be done. I am on earth to punish, madam," he added with a flaming look; "to any other woman, even to a queen, I would send the executioner; but to you I will be merciful. To you I say: is it not, madam, that you have preserved a few drops of your sweetest, quickest and safest poison?
108.117 --Oh, forgive me, sir, let me live!
108.118 --She is a coward!" said Villefort.
108.119 --Think that I am your wife!
108.120 --You are a poisoner!
108.121 --In the name of Heaven!...
108.122 --No!
108.123 --In the name of the love you had for me!...
108.124 --No! no!
108.125 --In the name of our child! Ah, for our child's sake, let me live!
108.126 --No, no, no! I tell you, one day, if I let you live, you might kill him too, like the others.
108.127 --Me! kill my son!" cried this savage mother, rushing towards Villefort; "me! kill my Edward! ah! ah!"
108.128 And an awful laugh, a demon's laugh, a madwoman's laugh, completed the sentence and was lost in a bloody rattle.
108.129 Mme de Villefort had fallen at her husband's feet.
108.130 Villefort approached her.
108.131 "Think of it, madame," he said, "if on my return justice is not done, I will denounce you with my own mouth and arrest you with my own hands."
108.132 She listened, panting, downcast, crushed; her eye alone lived in her and smoldered a terrible fire.
108.133 "You hear me," said Villefort; "I am going there to demand the death penalty against a murderer.... If I find you alive, you will sleep tonight in the Conciergerie."
108.134 Mme. de Villefort heaved a sigh, her nerves relaxed, she collapsed brokenly on the carpet.
108.135 The king's prosecutor seemed to feel a movement of pity, he looked at her less severely, and bowed slightly to her:
108.136 "Farewell, madam," he said slowly; "farewell!"
108.137 This farewell fell like a mortal knife on Mme de Villefort. She fainted.
108.138 The king's prosecutor went out, and on leaving closed the door with a double turn.
109.000 The assizes.
109.001 The Benedetto affair, as it was then called in the Palace and in the world, had produced an enormous sensation. A regular at the Café de Paris, on the Boulevard de Gand and in the Bois de Boulogne, the false Cavalcanti, while he had remained in Paris and during the two or three months that his splendor had lasted, had made a host of acquaintances. The newspapers had told of the various stations of the accused in his elegant life and in his life in prison; the result was the most lively curiosity among those especially who had personally known prince Andrea Cavalcanti; also those especially were decided to risk everything to go to the dock to see Mr. Benedetto, the murderer of his chain mate.
109.002 For many people, Benedetto was, if not a victim, at least an error of justice: they had seen Mr. Cavalcanti Sr. in Paris, and they expected him to appear again to claim his illustrious offspring. Many who had never heard of the famous polonaise with which he had landed at the Count of Monte Cristo's had been struck by the dignified air, the gentility, and the knowledge of the world shown by the old patrician, who, it must be said, seemed a perfect lord whenever he was not talking or doing arithmetic.
109.003 As for the accused himself, many people remembered having seen him so amiable, so handsome, so lavish, that they preferred to believe in some scheme on the part of an enemy such as one finds in this world, where great fortunes raise the means of doing evil and good to the height of the marvelous, and power to the height of the unheard of.
109.004 Everyone rushed to the court of assizes, some to savor the spectacle, others to comment on it. As early as seven o'clock in the morning there was a queue at the gate, and an hour before the session opened the room was already full of privileged people.
109.005 Before the entrance to the court, and even often afterwards, a courtroom, on the days of major trials, is very much like a living room where many people recognize each other, approach each other when they are close enough to not lose their seats, and wave to each other when they are separated by too many people, lawyers and policemen.
109.006 It was one of those magnificent autumn days which sometimes compensate us for an absent or shortened summer; the clouds which M. de Villefort had seen in the morning shading the rising sun had dissipated as if by magic, and left to shine in all its purity one of the last, one of the sweetest days of September.
109.007 Beauchamp, one of the kings of the press, and therefore having his throne everywhere, was looking right and left. He saw Château-Renaud and Debray who had just won the good graces of a city sergeant, and who had decided to stand behind them instead of masking them, as was his right. The worthy officer had sniffed out the minister's secretary and the millionaire; he showed himself full of consideration for his noble neighbors and even allowed them to go and visit Beauchamp, promising to keep their places for them.
109.008 "Well," said Beauchamp, "we have come to see our friend?
109.009 -- "Oh, my God, yes," replied Debray, "that worthy prince! May the devil be the Italian princes!
109.010 --A man who had had Dante for a genealogist, and who went back to _La Divine Comédie_!
109.011 --Noble rope, said Château-Renaud phlegmatically.
109.012 --He will be condemned, will he not?" asked Debray of Beauchamp.
109.013 -- "My dear," replied the journalist, "it seems to me that it is you who should be asked that: you know the air of the office better than the rest of us; did you see the president at your minister's last party?
109.014 -- Yes.
109.015 -- What did he tell you?
109.016 --Something that will surprise you.
109.017 --Ah, speak quickly, then, dear friend, it's been so long since anyone has said anything of that kind to me.
109.018 -- Well, he told me that Benedetto, who is looked upon as a phoenix of subtlety, as a giant of cunning, is only a very menial, very foolish trickster, and quite unworthy of the experiments that will be made after his death on his phrenological organs.
109.019 --Bah!" said Beauchamp; "he played the prince quite well, however.
109.020 --For you, Beauchamp, who hate them, these unfortunate princes, and who are delighted to find bad manners in them, but not for me, who instinctively sniffs out a gentleman and who raises an aristocratic family, whatever it may be, as a true sleuth of the coat of arms.
109.021 -- So you never believed in his principality?
109.022 -- In his principality? yes... in his principate? no.
109.023 --Not bad, said Debray; I assure you, however, that for any other than you he could pass... I saw him at the ministers' house.
109.024 --Ah! yes, says Château-Renaud; with that your ministers know themselves as princes!
109.025 --There is good in what you have just said, Château-Renaud," replied Beauchamp, bursting into laughter; "the sentence is short, but pleasant. I ask your permission to use it in my account.
109.026 -Take it, my dear Monsieur Beauchamp," said Château-Renaud; "take it; I give you my phrase for what it is worth.
109.027 --But, said Debray to Beauchamp, if I spoke to the president, you must have spoken to the king's prosecutor?
109.028 --Impossible; for eight days M. de Villefort has been crying; it is only natural: this strange series of domestic sorrows crowned by the strange death of his daughter...
109.029 --The strange death! What are you saying, Beauchamp?
109.030 --Oh, yes, play the ignorant, on the pretext that all this happens among the nobility of the robe, said Beauchamp, applying his lorgnon to his eye and forcing it to stand alone.
109.031 -My dear sir, said Château-Renaud, allow me to say to you that, for the lorgnon, you are not of the strength of Debray. Debray, give Mr. Beauchamp a lesson.
109.032 -Here, says Beauchamp, I am not mistaken.
109.033 --What is it?
109.034 --That's her.
109.035 --Who, her?
109.036 -- She was said to have left.
109.037 --Miss Eugenie?" asked Château-Renaud; "Has she returned yet?
109.038 -- No, but her mother.
109.039 --Mrs. Danglars?
109.040 --All right!" said Château-Renaud, "impossible; ten days after the flight of her daughter, three days after the bankruptcy of her husband!
109.041 Debray blushed slightly and followed the direction of Beauchamp's glance.
109.042 "Come now!" he said, "it is a veiled woman, an unknown lady, some foreign princess, the mother of Prince Cavalcanti perhaps; but you were saying, or rather you were going to say some very interesting things, Beauchamp, it seems to me.
109.043 --Me?
109.044 -- Yes. You were talking about Valentine's strange death.
109.045 --Ah, yes, that's true; but why isn't Mme de Villefort here?
109.046 - "Poor dear woman!" said Debray, "she is doubtless busy distilling lemon balm for the hospitals, and making up cosmetics for herself and her friends. You know that she spends on this amusement two or three thousand écus a year, as they say. By the way, you're right, why isn't Mme de Villefort here? I would have seen her with great pleasure; I like that woman very much.
109.047 -- And I," said Château-Renaud, "I hate her.
109.048 --Why?
109.049 -- I don't know. Why does one love? Why does one hate? I hate her out of dislike.
109.050 -- Or by instinct, always.
109.051 --Perhaps... But let's get back to what you were saying, Beauchamp.
109.052 --Well," continued Beauchamp, "aren't you curious to know, gentlemen, why people die so hard in the Villefort house?
109.053 -- "Dru is pretty," said Château-Renaud.
109.054 -My dear, the word is found in Saint-Simon.
109.055 --But the thing is in M. de Villefort's house; so let's go.
109.056 --My goodness!" said Debray, "I confess that I have not lost sight of this house, which has been in mourning for three months, and only the day before yesterday, in connection with Valentine, madame spoke to me about it.
109.057 -- What is madame?... asked Château-Renaud.
109.058 --The minister's wife, by God!
109.059 --Ah, pardon me," said Château-Renaud, "I don't go to ministers, I leave that to the princes.
109.060 -- You were only beautiful, you are becoming flamboyant, baron; have pity on you, or you will burn us like another Jupiter.
109.061 --I will say no more, said Château-Renaud; but what the hell, have pity on me, don't give me the reply.
109.062 -- Let's see, let's try to get to the end of our dialogue, Beauchamp; I was telling you that the day before yesterday Madame asked me for information about this; instruct me, I will instruct her.
109.063 -- Well, gentlemen, if one dies so badly, I maintain the word, in the Villefort house, it is because there is a murderer in the house!"
109.064 The two young men shuddered, for more than once the same idea had already occurred to them.
109.065 "And who is this murderer?" they asked.
109.066 -Young Edward."
109.067 A burst of laughter from the two listeners did not disconcert the speaker at all, and he continued:
109.068 "Yes, gentlemen, young Edward, phenomenal child, who is already killing like father and mother.
109.069 -Is this a joke?
109.070 --Not at all; yesterday I took a servant from M. de Villefort's: listen to this.
109.071 --We are listening.
109.072 --And whom I am going to dismiss tomorrow, because he is eating a lot to recover from the fast of terror he imposed on himself there. Well, it seems that this dear child has got hold of a bottle of drugs which he uses from time to time against those who displease him. First it was good daddy and good mommy of Saint-Méran who displeased him, and he poured three drops of his elixir on them: three drops are enough; then it was the brave Barrois, old servant of good daddy Noirtier, who bullied from time to time the lovable mischief-maker that you know. The amiable mischievous one poured three drops of his elixir to him. So it was with poor Valentine, who did not bully him, but of whom he was jealous: he poured three drops of his elixir on her, and for her as for the others everything was finished.
109.073 --But what kind of tale are you telling us here?
109.074 --Yes, said Beauchamp, a tale from the other world, isn't it?
109.075 --That's absurd, said Debray.
109.076 --Ah!" said Beauchamp, "you are already looking for ways to delay! What on earth! ask my servant, or rather the one who tomorrow will no longer be my servant: that was the noise in the house.
109.077 -But this elixir, where is it? what is it?
109.078 --The child is hiding it.
109.079 --Where did he take it?
109.080 --In his mother's laboratory.
109.081 --So his mother has poisons in her laboratory?
109.082 --What do I know! You've come to ask me questions like a royal prosecutor. I am repeating what I have been told, that is all; I am quoting my author: I cannot do more. The poor devil no longer ate with dread.
109.083 --That is incredible!
109.084 -But no, my dear, it is not incredible at all; you saw last year that child in the Rue de Richelieu, who amused himself by killing his brothers and sisters by sticking a pin in their ears while they were sleeping. The generation which follows us is very precocious, my dear.
109.085 "My dear," said Château-Renaud, "I bet you don't believe a word you're telling us.... But I do not see the Count of Monte Cristo; how then is he not here?
109.086 -- He is blasé, he," said Debray, "and then he will not want to appear in front of everyone, he who has been the dupe of all the Cavalcanti, who came to him, it seems, with false credentials; so that he is mortgaged for a hundred thousand francs on the principality.
109.087 -- By the way, Monsieur de Château-Renaud," asked Beauchamp, "how is Morrel doing?
109.088 --My goodness, said the gentleman, here are three times that I have been to his house, and no more of Morrel than on the hand. However, his sister did not seem worried, and she told me with a very good face that she had not seen him for two or three days either, but that she was certain he was well.
109.089 --Ah, I think of it! The Count of Monte Cristo cannot come into the room, said Beauchamp.
109.090 --Why not?
109.091 --Because he is an actor in the drama.
109.092 --Did he murder someone too? asked Debray.
109.093 --But no, it was he, on the contrary, who they wanted to murder. You know very well that it was on leaving his house that this good M. de Caderousse was murdered by his little Benedetto. You know well that it is at his place that one found this famous vest in which was the letter which came to disturb the signature of the contract. Do you see the famous vest? It's there, all bloody, on the desk, as evidence.
109.094 --Ah, very good.
109.095 -Hush, gentlemen, here is the court; let's go to our seats.
109.096 Indeed a great noise was heard in the praetorium; the town sergeant called his two protégés with an energetic hem! and the bailiff, appearing at the threshold of the deliberation room, shouted in that yelping voice that bailiffs already had in Beaumarchais' time:
109.097 "The court, gentlemen!"
110.000 The indictment.
110.001 The judges sat down in the midst of the deepest silence; the jurors took their places; M. de Villefort, the object of attention, and we would say almost of general admiration, sat covered in his chair, looking around him with a calm gaze.
110.002 Everyone looked with astonishment at this grave and stern figure, on whose impassivity paternal sorrows seemed to have no hold, and they looked with a kind of terror at this man who was alien to the emotions of humanity.
110.003 "Gendarmes!" said the president, "bring in the accused."
110.004 At these words the attention of the audience became more active, and all eyes were fixed on the door through which Benedetto was to enter.
110.005 Soon that door opened and the accused appeared.
110.006 The impression was the same on everyone, and no one could mistake the expression on his face.
110.007 His features did not bear the imprint of that deep emotion which drives the blood back to the heart and discolors the forehead and cheeks. His hands, gracefully placed one on his hat, the other in the opening of his white piqué vest, were not agitated by any shiver: his eye was calm and even brilliant. As soon as he entered the room, the young man's gaze wandered through all the ranks of the judges and the assistants, and stopped for a long time on the president and especially on the king's prosecutor.
110.008 Next to Andrea stood his lawyer, a lawyer appointed ex officio (for Andrea had not wanted to concern himself with these details to which he did not seem to attach any importance), a young man with blond hair and a face reddened by an emotion a hundred times more sensitive than that of the defendant.
110.009 The president called for the reading of the indictment, written, as we know, by the skillful and implacable pen of Villefort.
110.010 During this reading, which was long, and which for any other would have been overwhelming, the public attention did not cease to be focused on Andrea, who bore the weight of it with the cheerfulness of a Spartan.
110.011 Perhaps never had Villefort been so concise or so eloquent; the crime was presented in the most vivid colors, the antecedents of the accused, his transfiguration, the filiation of his acts since a rather tender age, were deduced with the talent that the practice of life and the knowledge of the human heart could provide to a mind as elevated as that of the king's prosecutor.
110.012 With this preamble alone, Benedetto was forever lost in public opinion, until he was punished more materially by the law.
110.013 Andrea did not pay the slightest attention to the successive charges which were raised and brought down on him: M. de Villefort, who often examined him and who undoubtedly continued on him the psychological studies which he had so often had occasion to make on the accused, M. de Villefort could not once make him lower his eyes, whatever the fixity and the depth of his gaze.
110.014 Finally the reading was finished.
110.015 "Defendant," said the president, "what are your first and last names?
110.016 Andrea stood up.
110.017 "Forgive me, Mr. President," he said in a voice whose tone vibrated perfectly pure, "but I see that you are going to take an order of questions in which I cannot follow you. I claim that it is up to me to justify later on being an exception to the ordinary defendants. Please, therefore, allow me to answer in a different order; I will not answer them all any less."
110.018 The president, surprised, looked at the jurors, who looked at the king's prosecutor.
110.019 A great surprise was manifested in the whole assembly. But Andrea did not seem to be moved at all.
110.020 "Your age?" said the president; "will you answer this question?
110.021 --To this question as to the others, I will answer, Mr. President, but in turn.
110.022 -- Your age?" repeated the magistrate.
110.023 --I am twenty-one years old, or rather I shall be only in a few days, having been born on the night of the 27th to the 28th of September 1817."
110.024 M. de Villefort, who was taking note, looked up at this date.
110.025 "Where were you born?" continued the president.
110.026 --Auteuil, near Paris," replied Benedetto.
110.027 M. de Villefort raised his head a second time, looked at Benedetto as he would have looked at the head of Medusa, and became livid.
110.028 As for Benedetto, he passed gracefully over his lips the embroidered corner of a fine batiste handkerchief.
110.029 "Your profession?" asked the president.
110.030 -First I was a forger, said Andrea most quietly; then I became a thief, and just recently I became a murderer."
110.031 A murmur or rather a storm of indignation and surprise broke out in all parts of the room: the judges themselves looked at each other in amazement, the jurors showed the greatest disgust at the cynicism that was so little expected of an elegant man.
110.032 M. de Villefort rested a hand on his forehead, which at first was pale, but had become red and hot; all of a sudden he stood up, looking around him like a man who had lost his way: he was out of breath.
110.033 "Are you looking for something, Mr. King's Attorney?" asked Benedetto with his most obliging smile.
110.034 M. de Villefort answered nothing, and sat down, or rather fell back in his chair.
110.035 "Is it now, defendant, that you consent to say your name?" asked the president. The brutal affectation which you have put into enumerating your various crimes, which you call a profession, the sort of point of honor which you attach to them, for which, in the name of morality and the respect due to humanity, the court must severely blame you, that is perhaps the reason which has made you delay naming yourself: you want to make this name stand out by the titles which precede it.
110.036 - "It is incredible, Mr. President," said Benedetto in the most gracious tone of voice and with the most polite manners, "how well you have read the depths of my thought; it was indeed for this purpose that I asked you to reverse the order of questions."
110.037 The astonishment was at its height; there was no longer in the words of the accused either boastfulness or cynicism; the moved audience sensed some dazzling thunderbolt at the bottom of this dark cloud.
110.038 "Well," said the president, "what is your name?
110.039 --I cannot tell you my name, for I do not know it; but I know my father's, and I can tell you."
110.040 A painful glare blinded Villefort; drops of acrid sweat were seen falling from his cheeks and pressed on the papers which he was stirring with a convulsive and distraught hand.
110.041 "Then say your father's name," the president continued.
110.042 Not a breath, not a breath disturbed the silence of this immense assembly: everyone was waiting.
110.043 "My father is a public prosecutor," Andrea answered quietly.
110.044 --Prosecutor of the king!" said the president in amazement, without noticing the disruption that was taking place on Villefort's face; "prosecutor of the king!
110.045 --Yes, and since you want to know his name I will tell you: he is called de Villefort!"
110.046 The explosion, so long contained by the respect which in a session one bears to justice, emerged, like a thunder, from the depths of all the chests; the court itself did not think of repressing this movement of the multitude. The interjections, the insults addressed to Benedetto, who remained impassive, the energetic gestures, the movement of the gendarmes, the sniggering of that mucky part which, in any assembly, rises to the surface at moments of disturbance and scandal, all this lasted five minutes before the magistrates and the bailiffs succeeded in restoring silence.
110.047 In the midst of all this noise, the voice of the president could be heard crying out:
110.048 "Are you playing with justice, accused, and would you dare to give your fellow citizens the spectacle of a corruption which, in an age which nevertheless leaves nothing to be desired in this respect, would not yet have had its equal?"
110.049 Ten people hurried to the king's prosecutor, half crushed in his seat, and offered him consolations, encouragement, and protestations of zeal and sympathy.
110.050 Calm had returned to the room, except for one point where a fairly large group was stirring and whispering.
110.051 A woman, it was said, had just fainted; she had been given salts to breathe and had recovered.
110.052 Andrea, during all this tumult, had turned her smiling face toward the assembly; then, leaning finally with one hand on the oak railing of her bench, and that in the attitude of the most gracious:
110.053 "Gentlemen," he said, "God forbid that I should seek to insult the court and make, in the presence of this honorable assembly, an unnecessary scandal. They ask me how old I am, I tell them; they ask me where I was born, I answer; they ask me my name, I cannot say it, since my parents have abandoned me. But I can say my father's name, without saying my name, since I have none, and I repeat, my father's name is M. de Villefort, and I am quite ready to prove it.
110.054 There was in the young man's accent a certainty, a conviction, an energy which reduced the tumult to silence. For a moment the eyes of the public prosecutor were fixed on the seat of his office with the immobility of a man who has just been turned into a corpse by lightning.
110.055 "Gentlemen," continued Andrea, commanding silence with his gesture and voice, "I owe you the proof and explanation of my words.
110.056 --But, exclaimed the president in irritation, you declared in the investigation that you were called Benedetto, you said that you were an orphan, and you gave Corsica as your homeland.
110.057 -- I said at the hearing what I had agreed to say at the hearing, because I did not want the solemn impact I wanted to give to my words to be weakened or stopped, which would not have failed to happen.
110.058 "Now I repeat to you that I was born in Auteuil, on the night of September 27 to 28, 1817, and that I am the son of M. the King's Attorney of Villefort. Now, do you want details? I will give you some.
110.059 "I was born on the second floor of the house number 28, rue de la Fontaine, in a room covered with red damask. My father took me in his arms, telling my mother that I was dead, wrapped me in a towel marked with an H and an N, and took me into the garden where he buried me alive."
110.060 A shudder ran through all those present as they saw the defendant's confidence grow with M. de Villefort's terror.
110.061 "But how do you know all these details?" asked the president.
110.062 --I will tell you, Mr. President. In the garden where my father had just buried me, a man who had a mortal grudge against him, and who had been watching for a long time to take Corsican revenge on him, had entered that very night. The man was hidden in a massif; he saw my father lock up a deposit in the ground, and struck him with a knife in the middle of this operation; then, believing that this deposit was some treasure, he opened the pit and found me still alive. This man carried me to the hospice of the Foundlings, where I was registered under the number 57. Three months later, his sister made the trip from Rogliano to Paris to fetch me, claimed me as her son and took me away.
110.063 "This is how, although born in Auteuil, I was brought up in Corsica."
110.064 There was a moment of silence, but such a deep silence, that, without the anxiety that a thousand chests seemed to breathe, one would have thought the room empty.
110.065 "Continue," said the voice of the president.
110.066 "Surely," continued Benedetto, "I could have been happy in the home of these good people who adored me; but my perverse nature prevailed over all the virtues that my adoptive mother tried to pour into my heart. I grew up in evil and I arrived at crime. Finally, one day when I was cursing God for having made me so wicked and for giving me such a hideous destiny, my adoptive father came to me and said:
110.067 "--Don't blaspheme, wretch! for God gave you the day without anger! the crime comes from your father and not from you; from your father who has doomed you to hell if you died, to misery if a miracle gave you back to the day!
110.068 "From then on I stopped blaspheming God, but I cursed my father; and that is why I made the words you reproached me with, Mr. President, be heard here; that is why I caused the scandal of which this assembly still shudders. If this is another crime, punish me; but if I have convinced you that from the day I was born my destiny was fatal, painful, bitter, lamentable, pity me!
110.069 --But your mother? asked the president.
110.070 --My mother thought I was dead; my mother is not guilty. I did not want to know my mother's name; I do not know her."
110.071 At this moment a high-pitched cry, which ended in a sob, resounded in the midst of the group that surrounded, as we have said, a woman.
110.072 This woman fell into a violent attack of nerves and was taken from the courtroom; as she was being carried away, the thick veil that hid her face was parted and Mrs. Danglars was recognized.
110.073 In spite of the overpowering of his enervated senses, in spite of the buzzing in his ears, in spite of the sort of madness that was shaking his brain, Villefort recognized her and got up.
110.074 "The proofs! The proofs!" said the president; "remember that this fabric of horrors needs to be supported by the most striking proofs.
110.075 --The evidence?" said Benedetto, laughing, "the evidence, do you want it?
110.076 --Yes.
110.077 --Well, look at M. de Villefort, and ask me again for the proofs."
110.078 Everyone turned to the king's prosecutor, who, under the weight of these thousand eyes riveted on him, advanced into the courtroom, staggering, his hair in disarray and his face cut by the pressure of his fingernails.
110.079 The whole assembly gave a long murmur of astonishment.
110.080 "They ask me for the evidence, Father," said Benedetto, "do you want me to give it?
110.081 -- "No, no," stammered M. de Villefort in a strangled voice; "no, it is useless.
110.082 --What do you mean, useless?" cried the president.
110.083 -- I mean to say," cried the king's prosecutor, "that I would struggle in vain under the mortal embrace that crushes me, gentlemen, I am, I recognize, in the hand of the avenging God. No proofs; there is no need of them; all that this young man has just said is true!"
110.084 A dark and heavy silence like that which precedes the catastrophes of nature enveloped in its leaden mantle all those present, whose hair stood on end.
110.085 "And what! Monsieur de Villefort," cried the president, "you are not giving way to a hallucination? What! you are enjoying the fullness of your faculties? It is conceivable that an accusation so strange, so unexpected, so terrible, has disturbed your mind?
110.086 The king's prosecutor shook his head. His teeth clashed violently like those of a man devoured by fever, and yet he was deathly pale.
110.087 "I am in full possession of my faculties, sir," he said; "the body only suffers, and that is understandable. I acknowledge myself guilty of all that this young man has just articulated against me, and I stand at home at the disposal of M. le procureur du roi my successor."
110.088 And uttering these words in a dull, almost muffled voice, M. de Villefort wobbled to the door, which the bailiff on duty opened for him with a mechanical movement.
110.089 The whole assembly remained mute and dismayed by this revelation and this confession, which made such a terrible denouement to the various events which, for the last fortnight, had agitated Parisian high society.
110.090 "Well," said Beauchamp, "let it be said now that the drama is not in nature!
110.091 --My goodness, said Château-Renaud, I would rather end up like M. de Morcerf: a pistol shot seems sweet next to such a catastrophe.
110.092 -- And then he kills, said Beauchamp.
110.093 -- And I, who for a moment had the idea of marrying his daughter, said Debray. She did well to die, my God, the poor child!
110.094 -The session is adjourned, gentlemen, said the president, and the cause is postponed until the next session. The case must be re-investigated and entrusted to another magistrate."
110.095 As for Andrea, still quiet and much more interesting, he left the room escorted by the gendarmes, who involuntarily showed him respect.
110.096 "Well, what do you think of that, my good man?" asked Debray of the town sergeant, slipping a louis into his hand.
110.097 --There will be extenuating circumstances", answered the latter.
111.000 Atonement.
111.001 M. de Villefort had seen the ranks of the crowd open before him, however compact it was. Great sorrows are so venerable that there is no example, even in the most unfortunate times, that the first movement of the gathered crowd was not a movement of sympathy for a great catastrophe. Many a hated person has been murdered in a riot; rarely has an unfortunate person, even a criminal, been insulted by the men who attended his death sentence.
111.002 So Villefort passed through the hedge of spectators, guards, and people from the Palace, and walked away, convicted by his own admission, but protected by his pain.
111.003 There are situations which men grasp with their instinct, but which they cannot comment on with their mind; the greatest poet, in this case, is the one who utters the most vehement and natural cry. The crowd takes this cry for a whole story, and they are right to be satisfied with it, and even more right to find it sublime when it is true.
111.004 Besides, it would be difficult to describe the state of stupor in which Villefort was when he left the Palace, to paint the fever that made every artery beat, stiffened every fiber, swelled every vein to breaking point, and dissected every point of the mortal body into millions of sufferings.
111.005 Villefort dragged himself along the corridors, guided only by habit; he threw off his shoulders the magisterial robe, not because he thought of leaving it for convenience, but because it was an overwhelming burden on his shoulders, a tunic of Nessus fruitful in torture.
111.006 He arrived tottering at the Cour Dauphine, saw his carriage, woke up the coachman by opening the door himself, and let himself fall on the cushions while pointing in the direction of the Faubourg Saint-Honoré. The coachman left.
111.007 All the weight of his collapsed fortune had just fallen on his head; this weight crushed him, he did not know the consequences; he had not measured them; he felt them, he did not reason his code like the cold murderer who comments on a known article.
111.008 He had God in his heart.
111.009 "God!" he murmured without even knowing what he was saying, "God! God!"
111.010 He could only see God behind the landslide that had just occurred.
111.011 The car was driving fast; Villefort, as he shook on his cushions, felt something bothering him.
111.012 He put his hand on this object: it was a fan forgotten by Mme de Villefort between the cushion and the back of the car; this fan awakened a memory, and this memory was a flash of lightning in the middle of the night.
111.013 Villefort thought of his wife...
111.014 "Oh!" he exclaimed, as if a red-hot iron were piercing his heart.
111.015 Indeed, for an hour he had had only one face of his misery before his eyes, and now suddenly another face was presented to his mind, and another no less terrible.
111.016 This woman, he had just made with her the inexorable judge, he had just condemned her to death; and she, she, struck with terror, crushed by remorse, crushed under the shame that he had just made her with the eloquence of his irreproachable virtue, she, poor weak and defenseless woman against an absolute and supreme power, she was perhaps preparing herself in this very moment to die!
111.017 An hour had already passed since her condemnation; no doubt at this moment she was replaying all her crimes in her memory, she was asking God for mercy, she was writing a letter to implore on her knees the forgiveness of her virtuous husband, a forgiveness which she was buying with her death.
111.018 Villefort let out a second roar of pain and rage.
111.019 "Ah!" he cried, rolling on the satin of his carriage, "this woman has only become a criminal because she has touched me. I sweat crime, me! and she won the crime as one wins the typhus, as one wins the cholera, as one wins the plague!... and I punish her!... I dared to say to her: Repent and die... me! oh! no! no! she will live... she will follow me... We are going to flee, to leave France, to go ahead as long as the earth can carry us. I was talking to her about the scaffold! Great God! How did I dare to pronounce this word! But, me too, the scaffold awaits me!... We will flee... Yes, I will confess to her! Yes, every day I will tell her, humiliating myself, that I too have committed a crime... Oh! alliance of the tiger and the snake! oh! worthy wife of a husband like me!... She must live, my infamy must make hers pale!"
111.020 And Villefort pushed down rather than lowered the front window of his coupé.
111.021 "Quick, quicker!" he cried in a voice that made the coachman jump on his seat.
111.022 The horses, carried away by fear, flew to the house.
111.023 "Yes, yes," Villefort repeated to himself as he drew nearer to his home, "yes, this woman must live, she must repent and bring up my son, my poor child, the only one, with the indestructible old man, who has survived the destruction of the family! She loved him; it was for him that she did everything. One must never despair of the heart of a mother who loves her child; she will repent; no one will know that she was guilty; these crimes committed at home, and of which the world is already worried, they will be forgotten with time, or, if some enemies remember them, well, I will take them on my list of crimes. One, two, three more, what does it matter! My wife will run away taking gold, and especially taking her son, far from the abyss where it seems to me that the world will fall with me. She will live, she will be happy again, since all her love is in her son, and her son will not leave her. I will have done a good deed; that lightens the heart."
111.024 And the king's attorney breathed more freely than he had done for a long time.
111.025 The carriage stopped in the courtyard of the hotel.
111.026 Villefort jumped from the footboard onto the stoop; he saw the servants surprised to see him return so quickly. He did not read anything else in their faces; no one spoke to him; they stopped in front of him, as usual, to let him pass; that was all.
111.027 He passed Noirtier's room, and through the door he did not worry about the person who was with his father; it was elsewhere that his anxiety drew him.
111.028 "Come on," he said, climbing the little staircase that led to the landing where his wife's apartment and Valentine's empty room were; "come on, nothing is changed here."
111.029 First of all he closed the door of the landing.
111.030 "No one must disturb us," he said; "I must be able to talk to her freely, accuse myself before her, tell her everything..."
111.031 He approached the door, put his hand on the crystal knob, the door gave way.
111.032 "Not closed! oh, well, very well", he murmured.
111.033 And he entered the small living room where in the evening a bed was being made for Edward; for, although he was in boarding school, Edward came home every night: his mother had never wanted to be separated from him.
111.034 He took in the whole of the little salon at a glance.
111.035 "No one," he said; "she's in her bedroom, no doubt.
111.036 He rushed to the door. There, the lock was set. He stopped shivering.
111.037 "Heloise!" he shouted.
111.038 He seemed to hear a piece of furniture move.
111.039 "Heloise!" he repeated.
111.040 --Who is there?" asked the voice of the one he was calling.
111.041 It seemed to him that this voice was weaker than usual.
111.042 "Open up! open up!" cried Villefort, "it's me!
111.043 But in spite of this order, in spite of the tone of anguish with which it was given, they did not open.
111.044 Villefort kicked down the door.
111.045 At the entrance to the room which led into his boudoir, Mme de Villefort was standing, pale, her features contracted, and looking at him with eyes of frightening fixity.
111.046 "Heloise! Heloise!" he said, "what is the matter with you? Speak!"
111.047 The young woman stretched out her stiff and livid hand toward him.
111.048 "It is done, sir," she said with a rasp that seemed to tear her throat; "what more do you want?"
111.049 And she fell from her height onto the carpet.
111.050 Villefort ran to her and seized her hand. This hand was convulsively clutching a crystal bottle with a golden stopper.
111.051 Mme de Villefort was dead.
111.052 Villefort, drunk with horror, stepped back to the threshold of the room and looked at the corpse.
111.053 "My son!" he cried suddenly; "where is my son? Edward! Edward!"
111.054 And he rushed out of the apartment shouting:
111.055 "Edward! Edward!"
111.056 This name was pronounced with such an accent of anguish, that the servants came running.
111.057 "My son! Where is my son?" asked Villefort. Let him be removed from the house, so that he doesn't see...
111.058 "Edward is not downstairs, sir," replied the valet.
111.059 -- He is no doubt playing in the garden; see! see!
111.060 -- No, sir. Madame called her son about half an hour ago; Mr. Edward entered Madame's house and has not come down since."
111.061 A cold sweat flooded Villefort's forehead, his feet stumbled on the paving stone, his ideas began to turn in his head like the disordered cogs of a watch breaking.
111.062 "To Madame!" he murmured, "to Madame!
111.063 And he slowly retraced his steps, wiping his forehead with one hand, leaning with the other against the wall.
111.064 On returning to the room it was necessary to see the body of the unhappy woman again.
111.065 To call Edward, it was necessary to awaken the echo of this apartment turned into a coffin; to speak was to violate the silence of the grave.
111.066 Villefort felt his tongue paralyzed in his throat.
111.067 "Edward, Edward," he stammered.
111.068 The child did not answer; where was the child who, according to the servants, had entered his mother's house and had not left?
111.069 Villefort took a step forward.
111.070 The corpse of Mme. de Villefort lay across the door of the boudoir in which Edouard was necessarily sitting; this corpse seemed to be watching over the threshold with fixed and open eyes, with a frightful and mysterious irony on its lips.
111.071 Behind the corpse, the raised door showed part of the boudoir, a piano and the end of a blue satin couch.
111.072 Villefort took three or four steps forward, and on the sofa he saw his child lying down.
111.073 The child was undoubtedly sleeping.
111.074 The unfortunate man had an inexpressible burst of joy; a ray of pure light descended into the hell in which he was struggling.
111.075 All he had to do was to climb over the corpse, enter the boudoir, take the child in his arms and flee with him, far, far away.
111.076 Villefort was no longer that man whose exquisite corruption made him the type of civilized man; he was a tiger wounded to death, leaving his teeth broken in his last wound.
111.077 He was no longer afraid of prejudice, but of ghosts. He took his leap and leapt over the corpse, as if he had been crossing a devouring inferno.
111.078 He took the child in his arms, squeezing it, shaking it, calling it; the child did not answer. He pressed his eager lips to his cheeks, his cheeks were cold and pale; he felt his stiffened limbs; he pressed his hand to his heart, his heart was no longer beating.
111.079 The child was dead.
111.080 A paper folded in four fell from Edward's chest.
111.081 Villefort, struck by lightning, let himself go on his knees; the child escaped from his inert arms and rolled towards his mother.
111.082 Villefort picked up the paper, recognized his wife's handwriting and looked at it eagerly.
111.083 Here is what it contained:
111.084 "You know if I was a good mother, since it was for my son that I became a criminal!
111.085 "A good mother does not leave without her son!
111.086 Villefort could not believe his eyes; Villefort could not believe his reason. He dragged himself towards Edward's body, which he examined once more with that meticulous attention which the lioness puts in looking at her dead cub.
111.087 Then a heart-rending cry escaped from his chest.
111.088 "God!" he murmured, "still God!
111.089 These two victims frightened him, he felt the horror of this solitude populated by two corpses rise in him.
111.090 Just now he had been sustained by rage, that immense faculty of strong men, by despair, that supreme virtue of agony, which drove the Titans to climb the sky, Ajax to show his fist to the gods.
111.091 Villefort bowed his head under the weight of pain, he got up on his knees, shook his hair wet with sweat, bristling with fear, and he, who had never had pity on anyone, went to find the old man, his father, to have, in his weakness, someone to tell his misfortune to, someone to cry to.
111.092 He went down the stairs we know and entered Noirtier's house.
111.093 When Villefort entered, Noirtier seemed to be listening as affectionately as his immobility allowed, to Abbé Busoni, who was still as calm and as cold as usual.
111.094 Villefort, on seeing the Abbé, raised his hand to his forehead. The past came back to him like one of those waves whose anger raises more foam than the other waves.
111.095 He remembered the visit he had made to the abbot the day after the dinner at Auteuil and the visit the abbot had made to himself on the day Valentine died.
111.096 "You here, sir!" he said; "but do you ever appear but to escort Death?"
111.097 Busoni straightened up; seeing the alteration of the magistrate's face, the fierce glare of his eyes, he understood, or thought he understood, that the scene of the assizes was accomplished; he ignored the rest.
111.098 "I came there to pray over the body of your daughter!
111.099 --And today, what are you coming to do?
111.100 --I have come to tell you that you have paid your debt to me enough, and that from this moment on I am going to pray to God that he will be content like me.
111.101 -My God!" said Villefort, recoiling with fear on his forehead, "that voice is not that of the Abbé Busoni!
111.102 --No."
111.103 The abbé tore off his false tonsure, shook his head, and his long black hair, ceasing to be compressed, fell back on his shoulders and framed his male face.
111.104 "It is the face of M. de Monte Cristo!" cried Villefort, his eyes haggard.
111.105 -It is not yet that, Mr. King's Prosecutor, look better and further.
111.106 --This voice! This voice! Where did I hear it for the first time?
111.107 --You heard it for the first time in Marseilles, twenty-three years ago, on the day of your marriage to Miss de Saint-Méran. Look it up in your files.
111.108 --You are not Busoni? You are not Monte Cristo? My God, you are that hidden, implacable, mortal enemy! I did something against you in Marseille, oh, woe is me!
111.109 --Yes, you are right, that's it, said the Count, crossing his arms over his broad chest; search, search!
111.110 --But what have I done to you? cried Villefort, whose mind was already floating on the boundary where reason and insanity merge, in that fog which is no longer a dream and which is not yet awakening; what have I done to you? say! speak!
111.111 --You have condemned me to a slow and hideous death, you have killed my father, you have taken away my love with my freedom, and my fortune with my love!
111.112 --Who are you? Who are you then? my God!
111.113 -- I am the specter of an unhappy man whom you have buried in the dungeons of the Château d'If. God has put the mask of the Count of Monte Cristo on this specter, which has finally come out of its grave, and has covered it with diamonds and gold so that you will not recognize it until today.
111.114 --Ah! I recognize you, I recognize you! said the king's attorney; you are...
111.115 --I am Edmond Dantes!
111.116 --You are Edmond Dantes!" cried the king's prosecutor, seizing the count by the wrist; "then, come!
111.117 And he led him up the staircase, into which Monte Cristo, astonished, followed him, not knowing himself where the king's prosecutor was leading him, and presuming some new catastrophe.
111.118 "Here! Edmond Dantes," he said, showing the Count the corpse of his wife and the body of his son, "look, are you well avenged?
111.119 Monte Cristo paled at this frightful sight; he understood that he had just overstepped the rights of vengeance; he understood that he could say no more:
111.120 "God is for me and with me."
111.121 He threw himself with a feeling of inexpressible anguish over the child's body, reopened his eyes, felt for the pulse, and rushed with him into Valentine's room, which he doubled up...
111.122 "My child!" cried Villefort; "he is taking my child's corpse! Oh! curse! woe! death to you!
111.123 And he wanted to rush after Monte Cristo; but, as in a dream, he felt his feet take root, his eyes dilated to break their sockets, his fingers curved over the flesh of his chest gradually sank into it until the blood reddened his nails; the veins of his temples swelled with boiling spirits which went to lift the too narrow vault of his skull and drowned his brain in a deluge of fire.
111.124 This staring lasted for several minutes, until the frightful upheaval of reason was accomplished.
111.125 Then he let out a loud cry followed by a long burst of laughter and rushed down the stairs.
111.126 A quarter of an hour later, Valentine's room reopened, and the Count of Monte Cristo appeared again.
111.127 Pale, the eye morne, the oppressed chest, all the features of this figure usually so calm and so noble were upset by the pain.
111.128 He held the child in his arms, to whom no help could give life.
111.129 He knelt down and laid him religiously next to his mother, with his head on her breast.
111.130 Then he got up and went out, meeting a servant on the stairs:
111.131 "Where is M. de Villefort?" he asked.
111.132 The servant, without answering him, extended his hand towards the garden.
111.133 Monte Cristo descended the staircase, advanced to the place designated, and saw, in the midst of his servants circling around him, Villefort with a spade in his hand, digging in the earth with a sort of rage.
111.134 "It's not here yet," he said, "it's not here yet.
111.135 And he searched further.
111.136 Monte-Cristo approached him, and softly
111.137 "Sir," he said to him in an almost humble tone, "you have lost a son, but..."
111.138 Villefort interrupted him; he had neither heard nor listened.
111.139 "Oh, I will find him," he said; "you may pretend that he is not there, but I will find him, even if I have to search for him until the day of the Last Judgment.
111.140 Monte Cristo recoiled in terror.
111.141 "Oh," he said, "he is crazy!
111.142 And, as if he feared that the walls of the cursed house would collapse on him, he rushed out into the street, doubting for the first time that he had the right to do what he had done.
111.143 "Oh, enough, enough like this," he said, "let's save the last one."
111.144 On his way home, Monte Cristo met Morrel, who was wandering in the hotel on the Champs-Élysées, silent as a shadow waiting for the moment fixed by God to return to his tomb.
111.145 "Get ready, Maximilian," he said to him with a smile, "we are leaving Paris tomorrow.
111.146 --Do you have nothing more to do there?" asked Morrel.
111.147 --No, replied Monte-Cristo, and God grant that I have not done too much there!"
112.000 The departure.
112.001 The events which had just taken place preoccupied all Paris. Emmanuel and his wife told each other about them, with a natural surprise, in their little salon in the Rue Meslay; they compared these three catastrophes, which were as sudden as they were unexpected, with Morcerf, Danglars, and Villefort.
112.002 Maximilian, who had come to pay them a visit, listened to them, or rather assisted in their conversation, immersed in his usual insensibility.
112.003 "In truth," said Julie, "would it not seem, Emmanuel, that all these rich people, so happy yesterday, had forgotten, in the calculation on which they had established their fortune, their happiness, and their consideration, the part of the evil genie, and that the latter, like the wicked fairies of Perrault's tales, whom one has neglected to invite to some wedding or christening, has suddenly appeared to avenge this fatal oversight?
112.004 -- How many disasters!" said Emmanuel, thinking of Morcerf and Danglars.
112.005 -- How many sufferings! said Julie, remembering Valentine, whom by instinct of woman she did not want to name before her brother.
112.006 -If it is God who has struck them, said Emmanuel, it is because God, who is the supreme goodness, has found nothing in the past of these people which merits the mitigation of the punishment; it is because these people were cursed.
112.007 -- Aren't you very rash in your judgment, Emmanuel? When my father, with his pistol in his hand, was ready to burn his brain, if someone had said, as you are saying now, "This man deserved his punishment," would that someone not have been mistaken?
112.008 --Yes, but God did not allow our father to succumb, just as he did not allow Abraham to sacrifice his son. To the patriarch, as to us, he sent an angel who halfway cut off the wings of Death."
112.009 He had hardly finished saying these words when the sound of the bell rang.
112.010 It was the signal given by the janitor that a visitor was coming.
112.011 Almost at the same moment the door of the salon opened, and the Count of Monte Cristo appeared on the threshold.
112.012 There was a double cry of joy from the two young men.
112.013 Maximilian raised his head and let it fall again.
112.014 "Maximilian," said the Count, without seeming to notice the different impressions that his presence produced on his guests, "I have come to fetch you.
112.015 -Finding me?" said Morrel as if emerging from a dream.
112.016 --Yes, said Monte Cristo; is it not agreed that I take you, and did I not warn you to be ready?
112.017 -Here I am, said Maximilian, I had come to say good-bye.
112.018 --And where are you going, Count?
112.019 -- To Marseilles first, madam.
112.020 --To Marseilles? repeated the two young men together.
112.021 -- Yes, and I will take your brother.
112.022 -- Alas! Monsieur le Comte," said Julie, "give us back his health!
112.023 Morrel turned away to hide his blush.
112.024 "So you have noticed that he was suffering?" said the count.
112.025 --Yes," replied the young woman, "and I am afraid that he is bored with us.
112.026 -- I will entertain him, said the Count.
112.027 -- I am ready, sir, said Maximilian. Farewell, my good friends! Farewell, Emmanuel! Farewell, Julie!
112.028 --Farewell?" cried Julie; "you are leaving at once, without preparations, without passports?
112.029 --These are the delays which double the sorrow of separations, said Monte Cristo, and Maximilian, I am sure, had to take precautions in all things: I had recommended it to him.
112.030 --I have my passport, and my trunks are packed, said Morrel with his monotonous tranquillity.
112.031 --Fortunately, said Monte Cristo, smiling, one recognizes there the exactitude of a good soldier.
112.032 --And you leave us like that, said Julie, at once? You don't give us a day, not an hour?
112.033 --My carriage is at the door, madam; I must be in Rome in five days.
112.034 --But isn't Maximilian going to Rome? said Emmanuel.
112.035 --I am going wherever the Count pleases to lead me, said Morrel with a sad smile; I belong to him for another month.
112.036 --Oh, my God! how he says that, Monsieur le Comte!
112.037 --Maximilian accompanies me, said the count with his persuasive affability, so calm yourself about your brother.
112.038 --Farewell, sister! repeated Morrel; farewell, Emmanuel!
112.039 -- He grieves me with his nonchalance, said Julie. Oh, Maximilian, Maximilian, you are hiding something from us.
112.040 --Bah!" said Monte Cristo, "you will see him come back cheerful, laughing and joyful."
112.041 Maximilian threw Monte Cristo an almost disdainful, almost irritated look.
112.042 "Let us go!" said the Count.
112.043 - "Before you leave, Monsieur le Comte," said Julie, "will you allow me to tell you everything that the other day...
112.044 --Madam, replied the Count, taking both her hands, anything you say to me will never be worth what I read in your eyes, what your heart has thought, what mine has felt. Like the Roman benefactors, I should have left without seeing you again; but this virtue was beyond my strength, because I am a weak and vain man, because the wet, joyful and tender look of my fellow men does me good. Now I am leaving, and I am pushing selfishness to the point of saying to you: Do not forget me, my friends, because you will probably never see me again.
112.045 --Do not see you again!" cried Emmanuel, while two large tears rolled down Julie's cheeks: "Do not see you again!" But it is not a man, it is a god who is leaving us, and this god is going to go back to heaven after having appeared on earth to do good!
112.046 -- Don't say that," said Monte Cristo, "never say that, my friends; the gods never do evil, the gods stop where they want to stop; chance is not stronger than they are, and it is they who master chance. No, I am a man, Emmanuel, and your admiration is as unjust as your words are sacrilegious."
112.047 And clasping on his lips the hand of Julie, who rushed into his arms, he held out his other hand to Emmanuel; then, tearing himself away from this house, the sweet nest of which happiness was the guest, he drew Maximilian behind him with a sign, passive, insensible, and dismayed as he had been since the death of Valentine.
112.048 "Give joy back to my brother!" said Julie in Monte Cristo's ear.
112.049 Monte Cristo shook her hand as he had shaken it eleven years before on the stairs leading to Morrel's office.
112.050 "Do you still trust Simbad the sailor?" he asked him, smiling.
112.051 --Oh, yes!
112.052 --Well, then, go to sleep in peace and in the confidence of the Lord."
112.053 As we have said, the post-chair was waiting; four vigorous horses bristled their manes and struck the pavement impatiently.
112.054 At the bottom of the stoop, Ali was waiting, his face glistening with sweat; he seemed to have come from a long ride.
112.055 "Well," asked the Count in Arabic, "have you been to the old man's house?"
112.056 Ali nodded.
112.057 "And did you put the letter in front of him, as I ordered?
112.058 --Yes," said the slave again respectfully.
112.059 --And what did he say, or rather what did he do?"
112.060 Ali placed himself under the light, so that his master could see him, and, imitating with his so devoted intelligence the physiognomy of the old man, he closed his eyes as Noirtier did when he wanted to say: Yes.
112.061 "Well, he accepts," said Monte Cristo; "let us go!"
112.062 He had scarcely let this word escape, when already the carriage was rolling and the horses were sending up a dust of sparks from the pavement. Maximilian accommodated himself in his corner without saying a word.
112.063 Half an hour passed; the carriage suddenly stopped; the Count had just pulled the silk cord that corresponded to Ali's finger.
112.064 The Nubian got out and opened the door. The night sparkled with stars. It was at the top of the Villejuif rise, on the plateau from which Paris, like a dark sea, shakes its millions of lights which seem like phosphorescent waves; waves indeed, waves more noisy, more passionate, more mobile, more furious, more greedy than those of the irate Ocean, waves which do not know calm like those of the vast sea, waves which always collide, always foam, always swallow!...
112.065 The Count remained alone, and at a sign from his hand the carriage took a few steps forward.
112.066 Then he looked for a long time, with folded arms, at that furnace where all those ideas which spring from the bubbling abyss to agitate the world come to melt, twist, and shape themselves. Then, when he had well stopped his powerful glance on this Babylon which makes dream the religious poets as the materialistic scoffers:
112.067 "Great city!" he murmured, bowing his head and joining his hands as if he had been praying, "it is less than six months since I crossed your gates. I believe that the spirit of God had led me there, he brings me back triumphant; the secret of my presence in your walls, I entrusted it to this God who alone was able to read my heart; only he knows that I withdraw without hatred and without pride, but not without regrets; only he knows that I did not use for myself, nor for vain causes, the power that he had entrusted me. O great city! it is in your palpitating bosom that I found what I was looking for; patient miner, I stirred your entrails to bring out the evil; now, my work is accomplished, my mission is finished; now you can offer me neither joys, nor pains. Farewell, Paris! Farewell!"
112.068 His gaze wandered again over the vast plain like that of a nocturnal genius; then, passing his hand over his forehead, he got back into his carriage, which closed upon him, and soon disappeared on the other side of the rise in a whirlwind of dust and noise.
112.069 They went two leagues without uttering a single word. Morrel was dreaming, Monte Cristo was watching him dream.
112.070 "Morrel," said the Count, "do you repent of having followed me?
112.071 -- No, sir, the Count; but to leave Paris...
112.072 --If I had believed that happiness awaited you in Paris, Morrel, I would have left you there.
112.073 -It is in Paris that Valentine lies, and to leave Paris is to lose her a second time.
112.074 --Maximilian, said the Count, the friends we have lost do not rest in the earth, they are buried in our hearts, and it is God who has willed it so that we should always be accompanied by them. I have two friends who always accompany me in this way: one is the one who gave me life, the other is the one who gave me understanding. Their spirit both lives in me. I consult them when in doubt, and if I have done any good, it is to their advice that I owe it. Consult the voice of your heart, Morrel, and ask it whether you should continue to make this wicked face to me.
112.075 -My friend, said Maximilian, the voice of my heart is very sad and promises me only misfortunes.
112.076 -It is the characteristic of weakened spirits to see all things through a veil; it is the soul that makes its own horizons; your soul is dark, it is it that makes a stormy sky for you.
112.077 --That may be true," said Maximilian.
112.078 And he fell back into his reverie.
112.079 The journey was made with that marvelous rapidity which was one of the Count's powers; the towns passed like shadows on their way; the trees, shaken by the first winds of autumn, seemed to come ahead of them like disheveled giants, and fled rapidly as soon as they had reached them. The next morning they arrived at Châlons, where the count's steamboat was waiting for them; without wasting a moment, the carriage was carried aboard; the two travelers were already on board.
112.080 The boat was built for racing, it looked like an Indian canoe; its two wheels seemed like two wings with which it skimmed the water like a travelling bird; Morrel himself experienced this kind of intoxication of speed; and sometimes the wind that made his hair float seemed ready for a moment to clear the clouds from his forehead.
112.081 As for the count, as he moved away from Paris, an almost superhuman serenity seemed to envelop him like a halo. It was as if he were an exile returning to his homeland.
112.082 Soon Marseilles, white, warm, alive; Marseilles, the younger sister of Tyre and Carthage, and which succeeded them in the empire of the Mediterranean; Marseilles, always younger as it grew older, appeared to their eyes. It was for both of them aspects fertile in memories that this round tower, this fort Saint-Nicolas, this city hall of Puget, this port with the brick quays where both had played children.
112.083 So, by mutual agreement, they both stopped on the Canebière.
112.084 A ship was leaving for Algiers; the parcels, the passengers piled up on the deck, the crowd of relatives and friends saying good-bye, shouting and crying, a spectacle that is always moving even for those who see it every day, could not distract Maximilian from an idea that had seized him from the moment he set foot on the broad slabs of the quay.
112.085 "Here," he said, taking Monte Cristo's arm, "is the place where my father stopped when the _Pharaoh_ entered the harbor; here the brave man whom you saved from death and dishonor threw himself into my arms; I can still feel the impression of his tears on my face, and he was not crying alone, many people were also crying when they saw us.
112.086 Monte Cristo smiled.
112.087 "I was there," he said, showing Morrel the corner of a street.
112.088 As he said this, and in the direction the Count was pointing, a painful groan was heard, and a woman was seen waving to a passenger on the departing ship. This woman was veiled, and Monte Cristo followed her with an emotion which Morrel would easily have noticed, if, unlike the Count, his eyes had not been fixed on the ship.
112.089 "Oh, my God!" cried Morrel, "I am not mistaken! That young man who salutes with his hat, that young man in uniform, is Albert de Morcerf!
112.090 --Yes, said Monte Cristo, I recognized him.
112.091 --How so? You were looking at the opposite side."
112.092 The Count smiled, as he did when he did not want to answer.
112.093 And his eyes returned to the veiled woman, who disappeared around the corner.
112.094 Then he turned around.
112.095 "Dear friend," he said to Maximilian, "don't you have something to do in this country?
112.096 -- I have to weep over my father's grave," answered Morrel, deafly.
112.097 -- Well, go and wait for me there; I'll meet you there.
112.098 -- Are you leaving me?
112.099 -- Yes... I too have a pious visit to make."
112.100 Morrel let his hand fall into the hand which the Count held out to him; then, with a movement of the head whose melancholy it would be impossible to express, he left the Count and went towards the east of the city.
112.101 Monte Cristo let Maximilian go away, remaining in the same place until he had disappeared, and then he made his way to the Allées de Meilhan, in order to find the little house which the beginnings of this story must have made familiar to our readers.
112.102 This house still stood in the shadow of the great avenue of lime trees which serves as a promenade for the idle inhabitants of Marseilles, lined with vast curtains of vines which crossed, on the stone yellowed by the burning sun of the Midi, their arms blackened and torn by age. Two stone steps, worn by the friction of feet, led to the front door, a door made of three boards which, despite their annual repairs, had never known putty and paint, patiently waiting for the humidity to return to approach them.
112.103 This house, all charming in spite of its dilapidation, all cheerful in spite of its apparent misery, was indeed the same one that Father Dantes had once lived in. Only the old man lived in the attic, and the Count had put the whole house at Mercedes' disposal.
112.104 It was there that the woman with the long veil entered, whom Monte Cristo had seen leaving the departing ship; she closed the door at the very moment he appeared at the corner of a street, so that he saw her disappear almost as soon as he found her.
112.105 For him the worn steps were old acquaintances; he knew better than anyone how to open that old door, whose wide-headed nail lifted the inner latch.
112.106 So he entered without knocking, without warning, like a friend, like a guest.
112.107 At the end of a brick-paved alley, rich with warmth, sun and light, a small garden opened up, the same one in which, at the place indicated, Mercedes had found the sum whose deposit the Count's delicacy had made go back twenty-four years; from the threshold of the street door one could see the first trees of this garden.
112.108 When he reached the threshold, Monte Cristo heard a sigh that sounded like a sob: this sigh guided his gaze, and under a cradle of Virginia jasmine with thick foliage and long purple flowers, he saw Mercedes sitting, bowed and weeping.
112.109 She had lifted her veil, and alone in front of the sky, her face hidden by her two hands, she gave free rein to her sighs and sobs, so long contained by the presence of her son.
112.110 Monte Cristo took a few steps forward; the sand screamed under his feet.
112.111 Mercédès raised her head and gave a cry of fright when she saw a man before her.
112.112 "Madam," said the Count, "it is no longer in my power to bring you happiness, but I offer you consolation: will you deign to accept it as coming from a friend?
112.113 -- "I am indeed very unhappy," answered Mercedes; "alone in the world... I had only my son, and he left me.
112.114 -- He has done well, madam, replied the Count, he is a noble heart. He understood that every man owes a tribute to the fatherland: some their talents, others their industry; these their watches, those their blood. By remaining with you, he would have worn out his life near you, which had become useless, he would not have been able to get used to your pains. He would have become hateful through impotence: he will become great and strong by fighting against his adversity which he will change into fortune. Let him reconstitute the future of both of you, madam; I dare to promise you that it is in safe hands.
112.115 --Oh! said the poor woman, shaking her head sadly, this fortune of which you speak, and which from the bottom of my soul I pray God to grant, I shall not enjoy. So many things have broken down in me and around me that I feel close to my grave. You have done well, Count, to bring me closer to the place where I have been so happy: it is where one has been happy that one must die.
112.116 -- Alas!" said Monte Cristo, "all your words, madam, fall bitter and burning on my heart, all the more bitter and burning because you are right to hate me; I am the one who has caused all your misfortunes: why don't you pity me instead of accusing me? you would make me even more unhappy...
112.117 --Hate you, accuse you, Edmund... To hate, to accuse the man who saved my son's life, for it was your fatal and bloody intention, was it not, to kill M. de Morcerf this son of whom he was proud? Oh, look at me, and you will see if there is in me the appearance of reproach."
112.118 The count lifted his gaze and stopped it on Mercédès, who, half standing, stretched out her two hands towards him.
112.119 "Oh, look at me," she continued with a feeling of deep melancholy; "one can bear the brightness of my eyes today, it is no longer the time when I came to smile at Edmond Dantes, who was waiting for me upstairs, at the window of that attic where his old father lived... Since that time, many painful days have passed, which have dug an abyss between me and that time. To accuse you, Edmund, to hate you, my friend! No, it is I whom I accuse and whom I hate! Oh, wretch that I am!" she cried, clasping her hands together and raising her eyes to heaven. Have I been punished! I had religion, innocence, love, those three happinesses which make angels, and, wretch that I am, I have doubted God!"
112.120 Monte Cristo took a step toward her and silently held out his hand.
112.121 "No," she said, gently withdrawing hers, "no, my friend, do not touch me. You spared me, and yet of all those you struck, I was the most guilty. All the others acted out of hatred, greed, selfishness; I acted out of cowardice. They wanted, I was afraid. No, don't press my hand. Edmund, you are thinking of some affectionate word, I feel it, don't say it: save it for another, I am no longer worthy. See... (she uncovered her face completely), see, misfortune has turned my hair grey; my eyes have shed so many tears that they are ringed with purple veins; my forehead is wrinkling. You, on the other hand, Edmond, are always young, always handsome, always proud. It's because you had faith; it's because you had strength; it's because you rested in God, and God supported you. I was a coward, I denied myself; God abandoned me, and here I am."
112.122 Mercédès melted into tears, her heart broke at the shock of the memories.
112.123 Monte Cristo took her hand and kissed it respectfully, but she herself felt that this kiss was without ardor, like the one that the Count would have placed on the marble hand of the statue of a saint.
112.124 "There are," she continued, "predestined existences whose first fault shatters the whole future. I thought you were dead, I should have died; for what was the use of my carrying your mourning in my heart forever? to make a woman of thirty-nine into a woman of fifty, that is all. What good was it that, alone among all, having recognized you, I only saved my son? Should I not also have saved the man, however guilty he was, whom I had accepted as my husband? Yet I let him die; what am I saying, my God! I contributed to his death by my cowardly insensitivity, by my contempt, not remembering, not wanting to remember that it was for me that he had become a perjurer and traitor! What use is it, after all, that I have accompanied my son to this place, since I am abandoning him here, since I am letting him go alone, since I am handing him over to this devouring land of Africa? Oh, I have been a coward, I tell you; I have denied my love, and, like the renegades, I bring misfortune to all that surrounds me!
112.125 -- No, Mercédès," said Monte Cristo, "no; take a better opinion of yourself. I am a noble and holy woman, and you have disarmed me by your pain; but behind me, invisible, unknown, irritated, there was God, whose agent I was, and who did not wish to restrain the lightning which I had thrown. Oh! I adjure this God, at whose feet I have been prostrating myself every day for ten years, I attest to this God that I had made the sacrifice of my life to you, and with my life that of the projects which were chained to it. But, I say it with pride, Mercedes, God needed me, and I lived. Examine the past, examine the present, try to guess the future, and see if I am not the Lord's instrument; the most terrible misfortunes, the cruelest sufferings, the abandonment of all those who loved me, the persecution of those who did not know me, that was the first part of my life; Then, all of a sudden, after captivity, solitude, misery, air, freedom, a fortune so brilliant, so prestigious, so excessive, that, unless I was blind, I must have thought that God had sent it to me for great purposes. From then on, this fortune seemed to me like a priesthood; from then on, not a thought in me for this life whose sweetness you, poor woman, have sometimes savored; not an hour of calm, not one: I felt driven like the cloud of fire passing through the sky to go and burn the cursed cities. Like those adventurous captains who embark on a dangerous voyage, who meditate on a perilous expedition, I prepared the supplies, I loaded the weapons, I amassed the means of attack and defense, accustoming my body to the most violent exercises, my soul to the roughest shocks, instructing my arm to kill, my eyes to see suffering, my mouth to smile at the most terrible aspects; of good, trusting, oblivious that I was, I became vindictive, dissimulated, malicious, or rather impassive like the deaf and blind fatality. Then I set out on the path that was open to me, I crossed the space, I reached the goal: woe to those I met on my way!
112.126 "Enough!" said Mercedes, "enough, Edmund! believe that she who alone was able to recognize you was also able to understand you. Now, Edmund, the one who was able to recognize you, the one who was able to understand you, that one, had you met her on your way and broken her like glass, that one must have admired you, Edmund! As there is an abyss between me and the past, so there is an abyss between you and other men, and my most painful torture, I tell you, is to compare; for there is nothing in the world like you, nothing like you. Now say good-bye to me, Edmund, and let us part.
112.127 -- Before I leave you, what do you desire, Mercédès?
112.128 -- I desire only one thing, Edmund: that my son be happy.
112.129 -Please the Lord, who alone holds the existence of men in his hands, to keep death from him, I will take care of the rest.
112.130 --Thank you, Edmund.
112.131 - But what about you, Mercedes?
112.132 -I have no need of anything, I live between two graves: one is that of Edmond Dantes, who died so long ago; I loved him! This word does not fit anymore to my withered lip, but my heart still remembers, and for nothing in the world I would like to lose this memory of the heart. The other is that of a man whom Edmond Dantes has killed; I approve of the murder, but I must pray for the dead man.
112.133 -- "Your son will be happy, madam," repeated the Count.
112.134 --Then I will be as happy as I can be.
112.135 --But... well... what will you do?"
112.136 Mercedes smiled sadly.
112.137 "You wouldn't believe it if I told you that I would live in this country like the Mercedes of old, that is, by working; I don't know anything but how to pray, but I don't need to work; the little treasure buried by you has ended up in the place you indicated; they will look for me, they will ask what I do, they won't know how I live, but who cares! it's a matter between God, you and me.
112.138-Mercedes," said the Count, "I do not reproach you for it, but you have exaggerated the sacrifice by abandoning all that fortune amassed by M. de Morcerf, half of which was rightfully due to your thrift and vigilance.
112.139 -- I see what you are going to propose to me; but I cannot accept, Edmond, my son would forbid it.
112.140 -So I shall be careful not to do anything for you that does not have the approval of M. Albert de Morcerf. I will know his intentions and submit to them. But, if he accepts what I want to do, will you imitate him without repugnance?
112.141 --You know, Edmond, that I am no longer a thinking creature; I have no determination except that of never taking one. God has shaken me so much in his storms that I have lost my will. I am in his hands like a sparrow in the claws of an eagle. He does not want me to die because I live. If he sends me help, it is because he wants it and I will take it.
112.142 - "Beware, madam," said Monte Cristo, "that is not the way to adore God! God wants us to understand him and to discuss his power: that is why he has given us free will.
112.143 -Mercians, don't talk to me like that! If I believed that God had given me free will, what would be left to save me from despair?
112.144 Monte Cristo paled slightly and bowed his head, crushed by this vehemence of grief.
112.145 "Don't you want to say good-bye to me?" he said, holding out his hand.
112.146 -On the contrary, I say good-bye to you," replied Mercedes, pointing to the sky with solemnity; "that is to prove to you that I still hope."
112.147 And after touching the Count's hand with her shivering hand, Mercédès dashed up the stairs and disappeared from the Count's sight.
112.148 Monte Cristo then slowly left the house and took the road to the port.
112.149 But Mercédès did not see him go away, although she was at the window of the small room of Dantes' father. Her eyes were searching in the distance for the ship that was taking her son to the vast sea.
112.150 It is true that her voice, as if in spite of herself, murmured softly:
112.151 "Edmond, Edmond, Edmond!"
113.000 The past.
113.001 The Count left the house with a grieved soul, where he left Mercedes, never to see her again, in all probability.
113.002 Since the death of little Edward, a great change had taken place in Monte Cristo. Having reached the summit of his revenge by the slow and tortuous slope he had followed, he had seen on the other side of the mountain the abyss of doubt.
113.003 There was more: this conversation he had just had with Mercedes had awakened so many memories in his heart that these memories themselves needed to be fought.
113.004 A man of the Count's caliber could not float for long in that melancholy which can give life to vulgar spirits by giving them an apparent originality, but which kills superior souls. The count told himself that to have almost arrived at blaming himself, an error must have crept into his calculations.
113.005 "I look at the past wrongly," he said, "and I cannot have been so mistaken.
113.006 "What!" he continued, "the goal I had proposed would be a foolish goal! What! I would have been on the wrong road for ten years! What! one hour would have been enough to prove to the architect that the work of all his hopes was a work, if not impossible, at least sacrilegious!
113.007 "I do not want to get used to this idea, it would drive me insane. What I lack in my reasoning today is the exact appreciation of the past because I see this past from the other end of the horizon. Indeed, as one moves forward, the past, like the landscape through which one walks, fades away as one moves away. What happens to me is what happens to people who have been injured in a dream; they look and feel their injury and do not remember receiving it.
113. 008 "Come on, then, regenerated man; come on, extravagant rich man; come on, awake sleeper; come on, all-powerful visionary; come on, invincible millionaire, take back for a moment this disastrous prospect of miserable and hungry life; go back along the paths where fate has pushed you, where misfortune has led you, where despair has received you; too many diamonds, gold and happiness radiate today on the glasses of this mirror where Monte-Cristo looks at Dantes, hide these diamonds, sully this gold, erase these rays; rich, find the poor; free, find the prisoner, resurrected, find the corpse. "
113.009 And while saying this to himself, Monte Cristo followed the Rue de la Caisserie. It was the same one through which, twenty-four years before, he had been led by a silent and nocturnal guard; these houses, with their laughing and animated appearance, were that night dark, mute and closed.
113.010 "They are, however, the same," murmured Monte Cristo, "only then it was night, today it is broad daylight; it is the sun that illuminates all this and makes it all joyful."
113.011 He went down to the quay by the Rue Saint-Laurent, and advanced towards the Consigne: it was the point in the port where he had been embarked. A promenade boat was passing with its canopy of coutil; Monte Cristo called the skipper, who swam at once towards him with the eagerness that boatmen who sniff out a good bargain put into this exercise.
113.012 The weather was magnificent, and the voyage was a feast. On the horizon the sun was descending, red and flaming, into the waves which were ablaze at its approach; the sea, plain as a mirror, wrinkled at times under the leaps of the fish which, pursued by some hidden enemy, dashed out of the water to ask for their salvation in another element; Finally, on the horizon one saw passing, white and graceful like travelling seagulls, the boats of fishermen who go to Martigues, or the merchant ships loaded for Corsica or for Spain.
113. 013 In spite of this beautiful sky, in spite of these boats with the graceful contours, in spite of this gilded light which flooded the landscape, the count, wrapped in his coat, remembered, one by one, all the details of the terrible voyage: that unique and isolated light, burning at the Catalans, that sight of the Chateau d'If which taught him where he was being led, that struggle with the gendarmes when he wanted to rush into the sea, his despair when he felt defeated, and that cold sensation of the tip of the rifle barrel pressed against his temple like a ring of ice.
113.014 And little by little, like those springs dried up by the summer, which when the autumn clouds gather moisten little by little and begin to flow drop by drop, the Count of Monte Cristo also felt that old extravasated gall which had once flooded the heart of Edmond Dantes flowing in his chest.
113.015 For him from then on no more beautiful sky, no more graceful boats, no more ardent light; the sky was veiled with funereal pancakes, and the appearance of the black giant which one calls the castle of If made him tremble, as if the ghost of a mortal enemy had suddenly appeared to him.
113.016 They arrived.
113.017 Instinctively the count drew back to the end of the boat. The owner had to say to him with his most caressing voice:
113.018 "We board, sir."
113.019 Monte Cristo remembered that at this same place, on this same rock, he had been violently dragged by his guards, and that he had been forced to climb this ramp by pricking his back with the point of a bayonet.
113.020 The road had once seemed very long to Dantes. Monte Cristo had found it very short; each blow of the oar had made spout out with the wet dust of the sea a million thoughts and memories.
113.021 Since the July revolution, there were no more prisoners in the Château d'If; a post destined to prevent smuggling inhabited its guardrooms alone; a concierge waited for the curious at the door to show them this monument of terror, which had become a monument of curiosity.
113.022 And yet, although he was informed of all these details, when he entered the vault, when he descended the black staircase, when he was led to the dungeons which he had asked to see, a cold pallor invaded his forehead, whose icy sweat was driven back to his heart.
113.023 The count inquired whether there were any of the former tellers from the time of the Restoration left; all of them had been retired or had moved on to other jobs. The concierge who led him had only been there since 1830.
113.024 He was taken to his own cell.
113.025 He saw again the dim daylight filtering through the narrow window; he saw again the place where the bed had been, removed since then, and, behind the bed, though blocked up, but still visible by its newer stones, the opening made by Abbot Faria.
113.026 Monte Cristo felt his legs weaken; he took a wooden stepladder and sat on it.
113.027 "Are there any stories about this castle other than that of Mirabeau's imprisonment?" asked the Count; "is there any tradition about these gloomy dwellings where one hesitates to believe that men have ever locked up a living man?
113.028 --Yes, sir," said the concierge, "and about this very dungeon, the teller Antoine has transmitted one to me."
113.029 Monte Cristo shuddered. This teller Antoine was his teller. He had more or less forgotten his name and his face; but, when his name was pronounced, he saw him again as he was, with his bearded face, his brown jacket, and his bunch of keys, the jingle of which he could still hear.
113.030 The Count turned around and thought he saw him in the shadow of the corridor, made thicker by the light of the torch burning in the janitor's hands.
113.031 "Does monsieur want me to tell him?" asked the concierge.
113.032 --Yes," said Monte Cristo.
113.033 And he put his hand on his chest to compress a violent heartbeat, afraid to hear his own story told.
113.034 "Say," he repeated.
113.035 "This dungeon," said the janitor, "was inhabited by a prisoner long ago, a very dangerous man, it seems, and all the more dangerous because he was full of industry. Another man lived in that castle at the same time as he did; this one was not wicked; he was a poor priest who was mad.
113.036 --Ah, yes, mad," repeated Monte Cristo; "and what was his madness?
113.037 -- He offered millions if they would give him his freedom."
113.038 Monte Cristo raised his eyes to heaven, but he did not see heaven: there was a veil of stone between him and the firmament. He thought that there had been a no less thick veil between the eyes of those to whom Abbot Faria offered treasures and those treasures he offered them.
113.039 "Could the prisoners see each other?" asked Monte Cristo.
113.040 --Oh, no, sir, that was expressly forbidden; but they evaded the defense by piercing a gallery that went from one dungeon to the other.
113.041 -- And which of the two pierced this gallery?
113.042 -- Oh, it was the young man, certainly," said the janitor; "the young man was industrious and strong, while the poor abbot was old and weak; besides, his mind was too wobbly to follow an idea.
113.043 - "Blind!" murmured Monte Cristo.
113.044 - "So much so," continued the concierge, "that the young man pierced a gallery; with what?" "We don't know, but he pierced it, and the proof is that we can still see the trace of it; here, do you see it?"
113.045 And he brought his torch close to the wall.
113.046 "Ah, yes, indeed," said the Count in a voice deafened by emotion.
113.047 --The result was that the two prisoners communicated together. How long this communication lasted is not known. But one day the old prisoner fell ill and died. Guess what the young man did?" said the janitor, interrupting himself.
113.048 --Say.
113.049 -- He took the dead man and laid him in his own bed with his nose to the wall, then returned to the empty dungeon, plugged the hole, and slipped into the dead man's bag. Did you ever see such an idea?"
113.050 Monte Cristo closed his eyes and felt himself going over all the impressions he had experienced when that coarse cloth, still imprinted with that coldness which the corpse had communicated to him, had rubbed his face.
113.051 The teller continued:
113.052 "You see, this is what his plan was: he believed that the dead were buried in the Château d'If, and as he suspected that no coffin was made for the prisoners, he intended to lift the earth with his shoulders, but unfortunately there was a custom in the château that disturbed his plan: they did not bury the dead; they were content to tie a ball to their feet and throw them into the sea: this is what was done. Our man was thrown into the water from the top of the gallery; the next day the real dead man was found in his bed, and everything was guessed, for the burial men then said what they had not dared to say until then, that at the moment the body had been thrown into the void they had heard a terrible scream, stifled at the very moment by the water in which it had disappeared.
113.053 The Count breathed with difficulty, sweat poured down his forehead, anguish gripped his heart.
113.054 "No!" he murmured, "no! this doubt I experienced was a beginning of oblivion; but here the heart is hollowed out again and becomes hungry for vengeance."
113.055 "And the prisoner," he asked, "was he never heard of?
113.056 --Never, never; you understand, of two things, either he fell flat, and, as he fell about fifty feet, he will have killed himself on the spot.
113.057 -- You said that a ball and chain was tied to his feet: he fell standing up.
113.058 -- Or he fell upright," said the janitor, "and then the weight of the ball will have dragged him to the bottom, where he stayed, poor dear man!
113.059 -- You pity him?
113.060 -- Yes, I do, even though he was in his element.
113.061 --What do you mean?
113.062 --That there was a rumor going around that this unfortunate man was, in his time, a naval officer detained for Bonapartism."
113.063 "Truth," murmured the Count, "God made you to float above the waves and the flames. Thus the poor sailor lives in the memory of some storytellers; we recite his terrible story by the fireplace and shudder at the moment when he split space to sink into the deep sea."
113.064 "They never knew his name?" asked the Count aloud.
113.065 --Ah, yes," said the guard, "how? he was known only by the name of number 34.
113.066 --Villefort, Villefort!" murmured Monte Cristo, "that is what you must have said to yourself many times when my specter bothered your insomnia.
113.067 --Does monsieur wish to continue the visit? asked the concierge.
113.068 --Yes, especially if you want to show me the poor abbot's room.
113.069 --Ah! from number 27.
113.070 -- "Yes, from number 27," repeated Monte Cristo.
113.071 And it still seemed to him that he heard the voice of the Abbot Faria when he had asked him his name, and that he had shouted that number through the wall.
113.072 "Come.
113.073 - "Wait," said Monte Cristo, "until I take a last look at all the faces of this dungeon.
113.074 --This is good timing, said the guide, I have forgotten the key to the other one.
113.075 --Find it.
113.076 --I'll leave you the torch.
113.077 --No, take it away.
113.078 --But you'll be left without light.
113.079 --I see the night there.
113.080 --Here, it's like him.
113.081 --Who, him?
113.082 --The number 34. They say that he had become so accustomed to the darkness that he could have seen a pin in the darkest corner of his cell.
113.083 -- "It took him ten years to get there," murmured the Count.
113.084 The guide walked away with the torch.
113.085 The Count had said the truth: no sooner had he been in the darkness for a few seconds than he saw everything as if it were daylight.
113.086 Then he looked around, then he really did recognize his dungeon.
113.087 "Yes," he said, "there's the stone on which I used to sit! there's the trace of my shoulders that have made their mark on the wall! there's the trace of the blood that flowed from my forehead one day when I wanted to break my forehead against the wall... Oh! these figures... I remember them... I made them one day when I was calculating the age of my father to know if I would find him alive, and the age of Mercedes to know if I would find her free... I had a moment of hope after having completed this calculation... I was counting without hunger and without infidelity!"
113.088 And a bitter laugh escaped from the Count's mouth. He had just seen, as in a dream, his father led to the grave... Mercedes walking to the altar!
113.089 On the other wall, an inscription struck his sight. It stood out, still white, against the greenish wall:
113.090 "MY GOD!" read Monte Cristo, "KEEP ME MEMORY!"
113.091 "Oh, yes," he cried, "this is the only prayer of my last days. I no longer asked for freedom, I asked for memory, I feared I would go mad and forget. My God! you preserved my memory, and I remembered. Thank you, thank you, my God!"
113.092 At that moment the light of the torch shimmered on the walls; it was the guide coming down.
113.093 Monte Cristo went to meet him.
113.094 "Follow me," he said.
113.095 And, without needing to go back up towards daylight, he led him along a subterranean corridor that led to another entrance.
113.096 Here again Monte Cristo was assailed by a world of thoughts.
113.097 The first thing that struck his eyes was the meridian traced on the wall, by means of which Abbot Faria was counting the hours; then the remains of the bed on which the poor prisoner had died.
113.098 At this sight, instead of the anguish which the Count had experienced in his dungeon, a sweet and tender feeling, a feeling of gratitude swelled his heart, two tears rolled from his eyes.
113.099 "It is here," said the guide, "that the mad abbot was; it is through here that the young man came to find him. (And he showed Monte Cristo the opening of the gallery which, on this side, had remained open). From the color of the stone," he continued, "a scientist has recognized that it must have been about ten years since the two prisoners communicated with each other. Poor people, they must have been very bored during those ten years."
113.100 Dantes took a few louis from his pocket, and stretched out his hand toward this man who, for the second time, pitied him without knowing him.
113.101 The janitor accepted them, thinking he was receiving some small coins, but by the light of the torch he recognized the value of the sum the visitor was giving him.
113.102 "Sir," he said, "you are mistaken.
113.103 -How is that?
113.104 --That's gold you gave me.
113.105 --I know that.
113.106 --How can you know that?
113.107 --Yes.
113.108 --Your intention is to give me this gold?
113.109 --Yes.
113.110 --And I can keep it in all conscience?
113.111 --Yes."
113.112 The concierge looked at Monte Cristo with astonishment.
113.113 "And _honesty_," said the Count like Hamlet.
113.114 --Sir," resumed the concierge, who dared not believe in his happiness, "sir, I do not understand your generosity.
113.115 --It is easy to understand, however, my friend, said the count: I was a sailor, and your story must have touched me more than any other.
113.116 -- Then, sir, said the guide, since you are so generous, you deserve that I offer you something.
113.117 -- What do you have to offer me, my friend?
113.118 -- Not, sir, not; something to do with the story of a short while ago.
113.119 --In truth!" exclaimed the Count, "what is it?
113.120 -- Listen," said the janitor, "this is what happened: I said to myself, 'There is always something to be found in a room where a prisoner has remained for fifteen years,' and I began to probe the walls.
113.121 --Ah!" exclaimed Monte Cristo, remembering the Abbot's double hiding place, "indeed.
113.122 -- By dint of searching, continued the concierge, I discovered that it sounded hollow at the bedside and under the hearth of the fireplace.
113.123 -- Yes, said Monte Cristo, yes.
113.124 --I lifted the stones, and I found...
113.125 --A rope ladder, tools? exclaimed the Count.
113.126 --How do you know that?" asked the janitor with astonishment.
113.127 --I don't know it, I can guess it, said the Count; it is usually these sorts of things that are found in the hiding places of prisoners.
113.128 -- Yes, sir," said the guide, "a rope ladder, some tools.
113.129 --And you still have them?" cried Monte Cristo.
113.130 -- No, sir; I sold these various objects, which were very curious, to visitors; but I have something else left.
113.131 --What then?" asked the Count impatiently.
113.132 -- I have a sort of book written on strips of cloth.
113.133 --Oh!" exclaimed Monte Cristo, "do you have this book left?
113.134 -- I don't know if it's a book, said the concierge; but I have what I tell you.
113.135 -- Go and fetch it for me, my friend," said the Count; "and, if that is what I suppose, be quiet.
113.136 -- I'm going, sir.
113.137 And the guide went out.
113.138 Then he went to kneel devoutly before the remains of the bed which death had made an altar for him.
113. 139 "O my second father," he said, "you who gave me freedom, knowledge, wealth You who, like the creatures of a higher essence than ours, had the knowledge of good and evil, if in the depths of the grave there remains something of us that shivers at the voice of those who have remained on earth, if in the transfiguration that the corpse undergoes something animated floats to the places where we have loved or suffered much, noble heart, supreme spirit, profound soul, by a word, by a sign, by some revelation, I beseech you, in the name of that paternal love which you accorded me and of that filial respect which I had vowed to you, to take away from me this remnant of doubt which, if it is not changed into conviction, will become remorse.
113.140 The Count bowed his head and joined his hands.
113.141 "Here, sir!" said a voice behind him.
113.142 Monte Cristo shuddered and turned around.
113.143 The concierge was handing him those strips of cloth on which Abbot Faria had poured all the treasures of his science. This manuscript was Abbot Faria's great work on royalty in Italy.
113.144 The Count seized it with eagerness, and his eyes first falling on the epigraph, he read: "Thou shalt pull out the teeth of the dragon, and tread down the lions, said the Lord."
113.145 "Ah," he cried, "there is the answer! thank you, father, thank you!"
113.146 Drawing from his pocket a small wallet, which contained ten bank bills of a thousand francs each:
113.147 "Here," he said, "take this wallet.
113.148 --You are giving it to me?
113.149 --Yes, but on condition that you don't look in it until I've gone."
113.150 And, placing on his breast the relic which he had just found and which to him had the price of the richest treasure, he dashed out of the subterranean, and getting back into the boat:
113.151 "To Marseilles!" he said.
113.152 Then as he went away, his eyes fixed on the dark prison
113.153 "Woe," he says, "to those who have had me locked up in this dark prison, and to those who have forgotten that I was locked up there!"
113.154 Passing again before the Catalans, the Count turned away, and wrapping his head in his cloak, he murmured the name of a woman.
113.155 The victory was complete; the Count had twice overcome doubt.
113.156 This name, which he pronounced with an expression of tenderness that was almost love, was the name of Haydée.
113.157 As he set foot on the ground, Monte Cristo made his way to the cemetery, where he knew he would find Morrel.
113.158 He, too, had searched piously for a grave in that cemetery ten years before, and had looked for it in vain. He, who was returning to France with millions, had not been able to find the grave of his father who had died of hunger.
113.159 Morrel had had a cross put there, but the cross had fallen down, and the gravedigger had made a fire of it, as gravediggers do of all those old woods lying in cemeteries.
113.160 The worthy merchant had been happier: he had died in the arms of his children, and had been led by them to lie next to his wife, who had preceded him into eternity by two years.
113.161 Two large marble slabs, on which their names were written, lay side by side in a small enclosure enclosed by an iron railing and shaded by four cypress trees.
113.162 Maximilian was leaning against one of these trees, staring at the two graves with unseeing eyes.
113.163 His grief was deep, almost lost.
113.164 "Maximilian," said the Count to him, "that is not where you should look, it is there!"
113.165 And he showed her the sky.
113.166 "The dead are everywhere," said Morrel; "isn't that what you told me yourself when you made me leave Paris?
113.167 --Maximilian, said the Count, you asked me during the journey to stop for a few days in Marseilles: is that still your wish?
113.168 --I have no desire, Count, but it seems to me that I will wait less painfully here than elsewhere.
113.169 --That's good, Maximilian, because I'm leaving you and taking your word with me, aren't you?
113.170 --Ah! I shall forget it, Count," said Morrel, "I shall forget it!
113.171 --No! you will not forget it, because you are a man of honor above all, Morrel, because you have sworn, because you will swear again.
113.172 -- O Count, have pity on me! Count, I am so unhappy!
113.173 --I have known a more unhappy man than you, Morrel.
113.174 --Impossible.
113.175 -- Alas!" said Monte Cristo, "it is one of the prides of our poor humanity that each man believes himself more unhappy than another unhappy man who cries and moans beside him.
113.176 -- What is more unfortunate than the man who has lost the only good thing he loved and desired in the world?
113.177 -- Listen, Morrel," said Monte Cristo, "and fix your mind for a moment on what I am going to tell you. I knew a man who, like you, had placed all his hopes of happiness on a woman. This man was young, he had an old father whom he loved, a fiancée whom he adored; He was about to marry her when suddenly one of those whims of fate which would make one doubt the goodness of God, if God did not reveal himself later by showing that everything is for him a means of leading to his infinite unity, when suddenly a whim of fate took away from him his freedom, his mistress, the future he dreamed of and believed to be his (for blind as he was, he could only read the present) to plunge him into the depths of a prison.
113.178 --Ah!" said Morrel, "one gets out of a dungeon after eight days, after a month, after a year.
113.179 --He stayed there fourteen years, Morrel," said the Count, laying his hand on the young man's shoulder.
113.180 Maximilian shuddered.
113.181 "Fourteen years!" he murmured.
113.182 -- Fourteen years," repeated the Count; "he too, during these fourteen years, had many moments of despair; he too, like you, Morrel, believing himself to be the most unfortunate of men, wanted to kill himself.
113.183 --Well?" asked Morrel.
113.184 -- Well, at the supreme moment, God revealed Himself to him by a human means; for God no longer works miracles: perhaps at first (it takes time for eyes veiled in tears to become completely clear), he did not understand this infinite mercy of the Lord, but finally he took patience and waited. One day he miraculously rose from the tomb, transfigured, rich, powerful, almost a god; his first cry was for his father: his father was dead!
113.185 --And my father is dead too, said Morrel.
113.186 --Yes, but your father died in your arms, loved, happy, honored, rich, full of days; his father to him had died poor, desperate, doubting God; and when, ten years after his death, his son sought his grave, his very grave had disappeared, and no one was able to say to him, "There rests in the Lord the heart that so loved you."
113.187 --Oh!" said Morrel.
113.188 --So that one was a more unfortunate son than you, Morrel, for that one did not even know where to find his father's grave.
113.189 --But, said Morrel, he still had the woman he had loved, at least.
113.190 -- You are mistaken, Morrel; this woman...
113.191 --She was dead? cried Maximilian.
113.192 --More than that: she had been unfaithful; she had married one of her fiancé's persecutors. So you see, Morrel, that this man was a more unhappy lover than you!
113.193 -- And to this man, asked Morrel, God sent consolation?
113.194 -- He sent him calm at least.
113.195 --And this man can still be happy one day?
113.196 --He hopes so, Maximilian."
113.197 The young man let his head fall on his chest.
113.198 "You have my promise," he said after a moment's silence, and extending his hand to Monte Cristo: only remember...
113.199 -On the 5th of October, Morrel, I expect you at the island of Monte Cristo. On the 4th, a yacht will be waiting for you in the port of Bastia; this yacht will be called _l'Eurus_; you will name yourself to the captain who will take you to me. It is said, is it not, Maximilian?
113.200 --It is said, Count, and I will do what is said; but remember that on October 5...
113.201 --Child, who does not yet know what a man's promise is... I have told you twenty times that on that day, if you still wanted to die, I would help you, Morrel. Farewell.
113.202 --Are you leaving me?"
113.203 --Yes, I have business in Italy; I leave you alone, alone in the grip of misfortune, alone with that eagle with the powerful wings that the Lord sends to his chosen ones to carry them, at his feet. The story of Ganymede is not a fable, Maximilian, it is an allegory.
113.204 -- When are you leaving?
113.205 -- Just now; the steamer is waiting for me, in an hour I'll be far from you; will you accompany me to the port, Morrel?
113.206 -- I am all yours, Count.
113.207 -- Embrace me."
113.208 Morrel escorted the Count to the harbor; already the smoke was coming out, like an immense plume, from the black tube that threw it to the heavens. Soon the ship left, and an hour later, as Monte Cristo had said, that same eagle of whitish smoke scratched, barely visible, the eastern horizon, darkened by the first fogs of the night.
114.000 Peppino.
114.001 At the very moment when the Count's steamboat disappeared behind Cape Morgiou, a man, running the post office on the road from Florence to Rome, had just passed the little town of Aquapendente. He walked far enough to make a lot of distance, without becoming suspicious.
114.002 Dressed in a frock coat, or rather in a coat that had been infinitely tired by the journey, but which still showed a ribbon of the Legion of Honor repeated on his habit, this man, not only by this double sign, but also by the accent with which he spoke to the postman, had to be recognized as French. Another proof that he was born in the land of the universal language is that he knew no other Italian words than those musical words which can, like Figaro's _goddam_, replace all the finer points of a particular language.
114.003 "_Allegro_!" he would say to the postilions at every rise.
114.004 "_Moderato_!" he would say to the postilions every time they went down.
114.005 And God knows there are ups and downs on the way from Florence to Rome along the Aquapendente road!
114.006 These two words, moreover, made the good people to whom they were addressed laugh a lot.
114.007 In the presence of the eternal city, that is to say, on arriving at the Storta, the point from which Rome can be seen, the traveler did not experience that feeling of enthusiastic curiosity which impels every foreigner to rise from his chair to try to catch a glimpse of the famous dome of St. Peter's, which is already visible long before he can see anything else. No, he only drew a wallet from his pocket, and from his wallet a paper folded in four, which he unfolded and refolded with an attention that looked like respect, and he contented himself with saying:
114.008 "Well, I still have it."
114.009 The car passed through the Porta del Popolo, took a left and stopped at the Hotel d'Espagnole.
114.010 Master Pastrini, our old acquaintance, received the traveler on the doorstep and hat in hand.
114.011 The traveler went downstairs, ordered a good dinner, and asked for the address of the Thomson and French house, which was immediately given to him, as it was one of the best known houses in Rome.
114.012 It was located in via dei Banchi, near St. Peter's.
114.013 In Rome, as everywhere, the arrival of a post office chair is an event. Ten young descendants of Marius and the Gracchi, barefoot, elbows pierced, but with their fists on their hips and their arms curved picturesquely above their heads, looked at the traveler, the post-chair and the horses; these city kids par excellence were joined by about fifty onlookers from the States of His Holiness, of the kind who make circles by spitting into the Tiber from the top of the St. Angelo Bridge when the Tiber has water.
114.014 Now, as the kids and the onlookers of Rome, happier than those of Paris, understand all languages, and especially the French language, they heard the traveler ask for an apartment, ask for dinner, and finally ask for the address of the Thomson and French house.
114.015 The result was that, as the newcomer left the hotel with the de rigueur cicerone, a man detached himself from the group of onlookers, and without being noticed by the traveler, without appearing to be noticed by his guide, walked a short distance from the stranger, following him with as much skill as an agent of the Paris police could have done.
114.016 The Frenchman was in such a hurry to make his visit to Thomson and French that he had not taken the time to wait for the horses to be harnessed; the carriage was to meet him on the way or wait for him at the banker's door.
114.017 They arrived without the carriage having joined them.
114.018 The Frenchman entered, leaving his guide in the anteroom, who immediately entered into conversation with two or three of those industrialists without industry, or rather with a thousand industries, who stand in Rome at the door of bankers, churches, ruins, museums or theaters.
114.019 At the same time as the Frenchman, the man who had detached himself from the group of onlookers also entered; the Frenchman rang the office bell and entered the first room; his shadow did the same.
114.020 "Mr. Thomson and French?" asked the stranger.
114.021 A sort of lackey rose at the sign of a trusted clerk, the solemn keeper of the first office.
114.022 "Whom shall I announce?" asked the lackey, preparing to walk before the stranger.
114.023 --Baron Danglars," replied the traveler.
114.024 --Come," said the lackey.
114.025 A door opened, and the lackey and the baron disappeared through it. The man who had entered behind Danglars sat down on a waiting bench.
114.026 The clerk continued to write for about five minutes; during these five minutes the seated man kept the deepest silence and the strictest immobility.
114.027 Then the clerk's pen ceased to cry out on the paper; he raised his head, looked around carefully, and after making sure of the head-to-head:
114.028 "Ah! ah!" he said, "are you Peppino?
114.029 --Yes," replied the latter laconically.
114.030 -Did you smell something good in this fat man?
114.031 --There is no great merit in this one, we have been warned.
114.032 --So you know what he's doing here, curious.
114.033 --Goodness, he's coming to collect; only it remains to be seen how much.
114.034 -- We'll tell you that later, friend.
114.035 --Fine; but don't give me false information, as you did the other day.
114.036 -- What is this, and who do you mean? Could it be that Englishman who took three thousand écus from here the other day?
114.037 -- No, that one did indeed have the three thousand écus, and we found them. I mean that Russian prince.
114.038 --Well?
114.039 -- Well, you accused us of thirty thousand pounds, and we only found twenty-two.
114.040 --You did not look hard enough.
114.041 --It was Luigi Vampa who made the search in person.
114.042 --In this case, he had or paid his debts...
114.043 --A Russian?
114.044 --Or spent his money.
114.045 -It is possible, after all.
114.046 --Sure; but let me go to my observatory, the Frenchman would do his business without my knowing the positive figure."
114.047 Peppino made an affirmative sign, and, drawing a rosary from his pocket, began to mumble some prayer, while the clerk disappeared through the same door that had given passage to the lackey and the baron.
114.048 After about ten minutes, the clerk appeared again, beaming.
114.049 "Well?" asked Peppino of his friend.
114.050 --Alert, alert!" said the clerk, "the sum is round.
114.051 --Five to six million, isn't it?
114.052 --Yes; do you know the figure?
114.053 --On a receipt from His Excellency the Count of Monte Cristo.
114.054 --You know the Count?
114.055 --And he has been credited with Rome, Venice and Vienna.
114.056 --That's it!" exclaimed the clerk; "how are you so well informed?
114.057 -- I told you that we had been warned in advance.
114.058 --So why are you talking to me?
114.059 --To make sure that this is the man we are dealing with.
114.060 --That's him... Five million. A nice sum, eh, Peppino?
114.061 --Yes.
114.062 --We'll never get that much.
114.063 --At least, Peppino replied philosophically, we'll have a few bits and pieces.
114.064 --Hush! Here is our man."
114.065 The clerk took up his pen, and Peppino his rosary; the one was writing, the other praying when the door opened again. Danglars appeared radiant, accompanied by the banker, who led him to the door.
114.066 Behind Danglars came Peppino.
114.067 According to convention, the car that was to meet Danglars was waiting in front of the Thomson and French house. The cicerone held the door open: the cicerone is a very complaisant person who can be used for anything.
114.068 Danglars jumped into the car, as light as a young man of twenty. The cicerone closed the door and got in next to the coachman. Peppino climbed into the back seat.
114.069 "Does His Excellency want to see St. Peter's?" asked the cicerone.
114.070 -For what purpose?" answered the baron.
114.071 --Lady, to see.
114.072 -- "I did not come to Rome to see," said Danglars aloud; then he added, with his greedy smile, "I came to touch.
114.073 And indeed he touched his wallet, in which he had just enclosed a letter.
114.074 "Then His Excellency will...
114.075 --To the hotel.
114.076 --Casa Pastrini," said the cicerone to the coachman.
114.077 And the carriage drove off as quickly as a master carriage.
114.078 Ten minutes later, the baron had returned to his apartment, and Peppino was sitting on the bench next to the front of the hotel, after having said a few words in the ear of one of those descendants of Marius and the Graccians whom we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, who, as he descended, took the road to the Capitol with all the speed of his legs.
114.079 Danglars was tired, satisfied, and sleepy. He lay down, put his wallet under his bolster and fell asleep.
114.080 Peppino had time to spare; he played _morra_ with the facchino, lost three écus, and to console himself drank a bottle of Orvietto wine.
114.081 The next day Danglars woke up late, although he had gone to bed early; for five or six nights he had slept very badly, when he did sleep at all.
114.082 He had a hearty breakfast, and not caring, as he had said, to see the beauties of the Eternal City, he asked for his horses for lunch.
114.083 But Danglars had counted without the formalities of the police and the laziness of the postmaster.
114.084 The horses arrived only at two o'clock, and the cicerone did not bring back the stamped passport until three.
114.085 All these preparations had brought a good number of onlookers to Master Pastrini's door.
114.086 The descendants of the Gracchi and Marius were not lacking either.
114.087 The baron passed triumphantly through these groups, who called him Excellency for a bajocco.
114.088 Since Danglars, a very popular man, as is well known, had been content to call himself a baron until then and had not yet been called Excellency, this title flattered him, and he distributed a dozen pauls to all these scoundrels, who were ready, for twelve more pauls, to call him Highness.
114.089 "Which road?" asked the postilion in Italian.
114.090 "The road to Ancona," replied the baron.
114.091 Master Pastrini translated the request and the answer, and the carriage galloped off.
114.092 Danglars did indeed want to pass through Venice and take part of his fortune there, then from Venice go to Vienna, where he would realize the rest.
114.093 His intention was to settle in the latter city, which he had been assured was a city of pleasure.
114.094 No sooner had he gone three leagues through the countryside of Rome than night began to fall; Danglars had not thought of leaving so late, otherwise he would have stayed; he asked the postilion how much time there was before he reached the next town.
114.095 "_Non capisco_," replied the postilion.
114.096 Danglars made a movement of the head which meant:
114.097 "Very well!"
114.098 The carriage continued on its way.
114.099 "At the first post office," said Danglars to himself, "I will stop."
114.100 Danglars was still experiencing a remnant of the well-being he had felt the night before, and which had given him such a good night. He was lying limply in a good English double-sprung carriage; he felt himself drawn along by the gallop of two good horses; the relay was seven leagues away, he knew. What to do when one is a banker and has fortunately gone bankrupt?
114.101 Danglars thought for ten minutes about his wife who had remained in Paris, for another ten minutes about his daughter who was running around the world with Miss d'Armilly, and for another ten minutes about his creditors and how he would use their money; then, having nothing more to think about, he closed his eyes and went to sleep.
114.102 Sometimes, however, shaken by a jolt stronger than the others, Danglars opened his eyes for a moment; then he felt himself carried with the same speed through the same countryside of Rome, dotted with broken aqueducts, which seem like giants of granite petrified in the middle of their course. But the night was cold, dark, rainy, and it was much better for a half-dazed man to remain in his chair with his eyes closed, than to put his head to the door to ask where he was to a postilion who could not answer anything else than: _Non capisco._
114.103 So Danglars continued to sleep, telling himself that it would always be time to wake up at the relay.
114.104 The carriage stopped; Danglars thought he had finally reached his longed-for goal.
114.105 He opened his eyes again, looked through the window, expecting to find himself in the middle of some town, or at least some village; but he saw nothing but a sort of isolated hovel, and three or four men who came and went like shadows.
114.106 Danglars waited a moment for the postillion who had completed his relay to come and ask him for the post-office money; he intended to take advantage of the opportunity to ask his new driver for some information, but the horses were unhitched and replaced without anyone coming to ask the traveler for money. Danglars, astonished, opened the door; but a strong hand immediately pushed it back, and the chair rolled away.
114.107 The baron, stunned, woke up completely.
114.108 "Eh!" he said to the postillion, "eh! _mio caro_!"
114.109 It was still romance Italian that Danglars had retained when his daughter sang duets with Prince Cavalcanti.
114.110 But _mio caro_ made no reply.
114.111 Danglars then merely opened the window.
114.112 "Hey, friend! Where are we going?" he said, sticking his head through the opening.
114.113 --_Dentro la testa!" cried a deep and imperious voice, accompanied by a gesture of threat.
114.114 Danglars understood that "dentro la testa" meant: "Put your head in. He was, as one sees, making rapid progress in Italian.
114.115 He obeyed, not without anxiety; and as this anxiety increased from minute to minute, after a few moments his mind, instead of the emptiness which we have indicated at the moment he set out, and which had brought on sleep, his mind, we say, was filled with a quantity of thoughts each more suitable than the other for keeping the interest of a traveler, and especially of a traveler in Danglars's situation, alert.
114.116 His eyes took on in the darkness that degree of sharpness which strong emotions communicate in the first moment, and which dulls later on from having been too much exercised. Before being afraid, one sees right; while one is afraid, one sees double, and after one has been afraid, one sees confused.
114.117 Danglars saw a man wrapped in a coat, galloping at the right-hand door.
114.118 "Some gendarme," he said. Have I been reported by the French telegraphs to the papal authorities?"
114.119 He resolved to get out of this anxiety.
114.120 "Where are you taking me?" he asked.
114.121 -- "Down the street!" repeated the same voice, with the same accent of threat.
114.122 Danglars turned toward the left door.
114.123 Another man on horseback was galloping to the left door.
114.124 "Decidedly," said Danglars to himself, sweat on his forehead, "I am decidedly taken."
114.125 And he threw himself back into his carriage, this time not to sleep, but to think.
114.126 A moment later the moon rose.
114.127 From the back of the carriage he looked out over the countryside; he saw again those great aqueducts, phantoms of stone, which he had noticed as he passed; only, instead of having them on the right, he now had them on the left.
114.128 He understood that the car had been turned around and that he was being taken back to Rome.
114.129 "Oh, you wretch," he murmured, "we will have obtained extradition!"
114.130 The car continued to run with frightening velocity. A terrible hour passed, for at each new clue thrown in his path the fugitive recognized, without a doubt, that he was being led back. Finally, he saw a dark mass against which it seemed to him that the car was going to collide. But the car turned away, skirting this dark mass, which was none other than the belt of ramparts that envelops Rome.
114.131 "Oh! oh!" murmured Danglars, "we are not entering the city, so it is not justice that is arresting me. Good God! Another idea, would it be..."
114.132 His hair stood on end.
114.133 He remembered those interesting stories of Roman bandits, so little believed in Paris, and which Albert de Morcerf had told to Mme. Danglars and Eugenie when it was a question, for the young viscount, of becoming the son of the one and the husband of the other.
114.134 "Thieves, perhaps!" he murmured.
114.135 Suddenly the carriage rolled over something harder than the floor of a sanded road. Danglars ventured a glance at both sides of the road; he saw monuments of strange shape, and his thought preoccupied with Morcerf's account, which now presented itself to him in all its details, his thought told him that he must be on the Appian Way.
114.136 To the left of the carriage, in a sort of valley, was a circular excavation.
114.137 This was the Circus of Caracalla.
114.138 At a word from the man who was galloping at the right door, the car stopped.
114.139 At the same time, the left door opened.
114.140 "Scendi!" commanded a voice.
114.141 Danglars got out at once; he did not yet speak Italian, but he could already hear it.
114.142 More dead than alive, the baron looked around.
114.143 Four men surrounded him, not counting the postilion.
114.144 "_Di quà_," said one of the four men, as they descended a little path which led from the Appian Way into the midst of those uneven hatchments of the Roman countryside.
114.145 Danglars followed his guide without question, and did not need to turn around to know that he was being followed by the other three men.
114.146 However, it seemed to him that these men stopped like sentries at about equal distances.
114.147 After walking for about ten minutes, during which time Danglars did not exchange a single word with his guide, he found himself between a mound and a bush of tall grass; three men, standing and silent, formed a triangle with him at the center.
114.148 He wanted to speak, but his tongue got stuck.
114.149 "_Avanti_," said the same voice with a brief, imperative accent.
114.150 This time Danglars understood doubly: he understood by word and by deed, for the man walking behind him pushed him forward so roughly that he collided with his guide.
114.151 This guide was our friend Peppino, who went into the high grass by a sinuosity that only the weasels and lizards could recognize as a cleared path.
114.152 Peppino stopped in front of a rock surmounted by a thick bush; this rock, half-opened like an eyelid, gave way to the young man, who disappeared into it as the devils of our fairy tales disappear into their traps.
114.153 The voice and the gesture of the one who was following Danglars engaged the banker to do the same. There was no longer any doubt that the French banker was dealing with Roman bandits.
114.154 Danglars complied like a man placed between two terrible dangers, and whom fear makes brave. In spite of his belly being ill-disposed enough to penetrate the crevices of the Roman countryside, he crept up behind Peppino, and, letting himself slide down with his eyes closed, he fell on his feet.
114.155 Touching the ground, he opened his eyes again.
114.156 The path was wide, but dark. Peppino, unconcerned about hiding, now that he was home, beat the lighter and lit a torch.
114.157 Two other men went down behind Danglars, forming the rear guard, and, pushing Danglars when he happened to stop, brought him by a gentle slope to the center of a crossroads of sinister appearance.
114.158 Indeed, the walls of the walls, hollowed out into coffins superimposed on one another, seemed, in the midst of the white stones, to open those deep black eyes that one notices in the heads of the dead.
114.159 A sentry made the nasturtiums of his rifle beat against his left hand.
114.160 "Who's alive?" said the sentry.
114.161 - "Friend, friend!" said Peppino. Where is the captain?
114.162 -There, said the sentry, pointing over his shoulder to a sort of large room dug into the rock, whose light was reflected in the corridor through large arched openings.
114.163 - "Good prey, Captain, good prey," said Peppino in Italian.
114.164 And taking Danglars by the collar of his frock coat, he led him towards an opening resembling a door, and by which one entered the room of which the captain seemed to have made his lodging.
114.165 "Is this the man?" asked the latter, who was reading the Life of Alexander in Plutarch very attentively.
114.166 --Himself, Captain, himself.
114.167 --Very well, show him to me."
114.168 At this rather impertinent order, Peppino brought his torch so abruptly near Danglars' face, that the latter drew back sharply so as not to have his eyebrows burned. This upset face offered all the symptoms of a pale and hideous terror.
114.169 "This man is tired," said the captain, "let him be taken to his bed.
114.170 --Oh!" murmured Danglars, "this bed is probably one of the coffins which are digging in the wall; this sleep is the death which one of the daggers which I see sparkling in the shadows is going to give me."
114.171 Indeed, in the dark depths of the immense room, one could see the companions of this man whom Albert de Morcerf had found reading the _Commentaries of Caesar_, and whom Danglars found reading the _Life of Alexander_, rising from their layers of dry grass or wolf skins.
114.172 The banker gave a muffled groan and followed his guide: he did not try to pray or to cry out. He had no strength, no will, no power, no feeling; he was going because he was being dragged along.
114.173 He hit a step and, realizing that he had a staircase in front of him, he instinctively bent down so as not to break his forehead, and found himself in a cell cut into the rock.
114.174 This cell was clean, though bare, dry, though situated under the earth at an immeasurable depth.
114.175 A bed made of dry grass, covered with goat skins, was not set up, but stretched out in a corner of this cell. Danglars, on seeing it, thought he saw the radiant symbol of his salvation.
114.176 "Oh, thank God!" he murmured, "this is a real bed!
114.177 It was the second time in the last hour that he had invoked the name of God; it had not happened to him for ten years.
114.178 "_Ecco_," said the guide.
114.179 And pushing Danglars into the cell, he closed the door on him.
114.180 A lock creaked; Danglars was a prisoner.
114.181 Besides, if there had been no lock, one would have had to be St. Peter and have an angel from heaven for a guide to pass through the garrison that held the catacombs of San Sebastian, and that camped around its leader, in whom our readers have certainly recognized the famous Luigi Vampa.
114.182 Danglars, too, had recognized this bandit, whose existence he had not wanted to believe in when Morcerf was trying to naturalize him in France. Not only had he recognized him, but also the cell in which Morcerf had been locked up, and which, in all probability, was the foreigner's quarters.
114.183 These recollections, on which, moreover, Danglars dwelt with a certain joy, restored him to tranquillity. As long as they had not killed him immediately, the bandits had no intention of killing him at all.
114.184 They had arrested him to rob him, and since he had only a few louis on him, they would ransom him.
114.185 He remembered that Morcerf had been charged something like four thousand écus; as he gave himself a much larger appearance than Morcerf, he set his ransom in his mind at eight thousand écus.
114.186 Eight thousand écus made forty-eight thousand livres.
114.187 He still had something like five million fifty thousand francs left.
114.188 With that, one can get away with anything.
114.189 So, almost certain of getting out of trouble, since there is no example of a man ever having been taxed at five million fifty thousand pounds, Danglars lay down on his bed, where, after turning over two or three times, he fell asleep with the tranquility of the hero whose story Luigi Vampa was studying.
115.000 Luigi Vampa's card.
115.001 To every sleep that is not the one Danglars dreaded, there is an awakening.
115.002 Danglars woke up.
115.003 For a Parisian accustomed to silk curtains, to the velvety walls of the walls, to the perfume that rises from the whitening wood in the fireplace and descends from the satin vaults, waking up in a cave of chalky stone must be like a bad dream.
115.004 By touching his curtains of goat skin, Danglars had to believe that he was dreaming Samoids or Lapps.
115.005 But in such a circumstance a second is enough to change the most robust doubt into certainty.
115.006 "Yes, yes," he murmured, "I am in the hands of the bandits of whom Albert de Morcerf has spoken."
115.007 His first movement was to breathe, in order to make sure that he was not wounded: it was a means he had found in _Don Quixote_, the only book, not that he had read, but from which he had retained something.
115.008 "No," he said, "they have not killed or wounded me, but perhaps they have robbed me?"
115.009 And he quickly put his hands in his pockets. They were intact: the hundred louis that he had reserved for himself to make his trip from Rome to Venice were well in the pocket of his pants, and the wallet in which was the letter of credit of five million fifty thousand francs was well in the pocket of his frock coat.
115.010 "Strange bandits," he said to himself, "who have left me my purse and my wallet! As I said yesterday when I went to bed, they are going to hold me for ransom. Here! I also have my watch! Let's see what time it is."
115.011 Danglars' watch, a masterpiece of Bréguet, which he had carefully wound the day before before setting out, struck half past five in the morning. Without it, Danglars would have remained completely uncertain about the time, as the day did not penetrate his cell.
115.012 Should he provoke an explanation from the bandits? Should he wait patiently until they asked for it? The last alternative was the most prudent: Danglars waited.
115.013 He waited until noon.
115.014 All this time a sentry had been watching his door. At eight o'clock in the morning, the sentry had been relieved.
115.015 Danglars then had the urge to see who was guarding him.
115.016 He had noticed that rays of light, not from daylight but from a lamp, were filtering through the grooves of the poorly joined door, and he approached one of these openings just as the bandit was taking a few sips of brandy, which, thanks to the skin pouch that contained it, gave off an odor that was very repulsive to Danglars.
115.017 "Ugh!" he said, backing up to the back of his cell.
115.018 At noon, the man with the brandy was replaced by another guard. Danglars was curious to see his new guard; he approached the joint again.
115.019 This one was an athletic bandit, a Goliath with big eyes, thick lips, and a squashed nose; his red hair hung over his shoulders in wisps twisted like snakes.
115.020 "Oh! oh!" said Danglars, "this one here looks more like an ogre than a human creature; in any case, I'm old and pretty tough; big white guy not good for eating."
115.021 As we see, Danglars still had enough spirit to joke.
115.022 At the same moment, as if to give him proof that he was not an ogre, his keeper sat down in front of the door of his cell, drew from his bissac some black bread, onions, and cheese, which he began incontinently to devour.
115.023 "The devil take me," said Danglars, glancing through the slits in his door at the bandit's dinner: "the devil take me if I understand how one can eat such garbage."
115.024 And he went and sat down on his goat skins, which reminded him of the smell of the brandy of the first sentry.
115.025 But Danglars had done well, and the secrets of nature are incomprehensible, there is indeed eloquence in certain material invitations which the coarsest substances address to stomachs on an empty stomach.
115.026 Danglars suddenly felt that his own had no funds at this moment: he saw the man less ugly, the bread less black, the cheese fresher.
115.027 Finally, these raw onions, the awful food of the savage, reminded him of certain sauces Robert and certain mirotons which his cook executed in a superior manner, when Danglars said to him: "Monsieur Deniseau, make me, for today, a good little scoundrel dish."
115.028 He got up and went to knock on the door.
115.029 The bandit raised his head.
115.030 Danglars saw that he was heard, and redoubled his efforts.
115.031 "_Che cosa_?" asked the bandit.
115.032 --Say so! say so! friend," said Danglars, drumming his fingers against his door, "it seems to me that it is time that they thought of feeding me too!
115.033 But either he did not understand, or he had no orders about Danglars' food, the giant went back to his dinner.
115.034 Danglars felt his pride humiliated, and, not wanting to commit himself any more with this brute, he lay down again on his goat skins and did not breathe a word.
115.035 Four hours passed; the giant was replaced by another bandit. Danglars, who was experiencing terrible stomach pains, got up slowly, put his ear to the cracks in the door again, and recognized the intelligent figure of his guide.
115.036 It was indeed Peppino, who was preparing to keep the gentlest possible watch, sitting down in front of the door, and placing between his two legs an earthen pan, which contained, hot and fragrant, chickpeas fricasseed with bacon.
115.037 Close to these chickpeas Peppino put again a pretty small basket of grapes of Velletri and a fiasco of wine of Orvietto.
115.038 Decidedly Peppino was a gourmet.
115.039 Seeing these gastronomic preparations, the water came to the mouth of Danglars.
115.040 "Ah! ah!" said the prisoner, "let's see if this one will be more treatable than the other."
115.041 And he knocked gently on his door.
115.042 "Let's go," said the bandit, who, by frequenting the house of Master Pastrini, had come to learn French down to its idiocies."
115.043 Indeed he came to open the door.
115.044 Danglars recognized him for the one who had shouted at him in such a furious manner: "Pull your head in." But this was no time for recriminations. He assumed instead his most pleasant countenance, and with a gracious smile:
115.045 "Pardon, sir," he said, "but will I not be given dinner, too?
115.046 -How can this be!" exclaimed Peppino, "is your Excellency by any chance hungry?
115.047 - "By chance is charming," murmured Danglars; "it is just twenty-four hours since I ate.
115.048 "But yes, sir," he added, raising his voice, "I am hungry, and even quite hungry.
115.049 --And Your Excellency wants to eat?
115.050 -- At once, if possible.
115.051 -- Nothing could be easier, said Peppino; here one can get whatever one desires, paying, of course, as is done among all honest Christians.
115.052 --That goes without saying!" exclaimed Danglars, "although in truth the people who arrest and imprison you should at least feed their prisoners.
115.053 --Ah, Excellency," continued Peppino, "that is not the custom.
115.054 --That's a pretty bad reason," said Danglars, who intended to soften his guard by his friendliness, "and yet I'm satisfied with it. Let's see, let them serve me food.
115.055 -- At once, Excellency; what do you desire?"
115.056 And Peppino placed his bowl on the ground, so that the smoke rose directly to Danglars' nostrils.
115.057 "Order," he said.
115.058 --So you have kitchens here?" asked the banker.
115.059 --How can we have kitchens? Perfect kitchens!
115.060 --And cooks?
115.061 --Excellent!
115.062 --Well, chicken, fish, game, anything, as long as I eat.
115.063 --As Your Excellency pleases; we say a chicken, don't we?
115.064 --Yes, a chicken."
115.065 Peppino, straightening up, shouted with all his lungs:
115.066 "A chicken for His Excellency!"
115.067 Peppino's voice was still vibrating under the vaults when already a young man appeared, handsome, slender, and half-naked like the bearers of ancient fish; he brought the chicken on a silver dish, and the chicken stood alone on his head.
115.068 "You would think you were at the _Café de Paris_," murmured Danglars.
115.069 -- "Here you are, Excellency," said Peppino, taking the chicken from the young bandit's hands and placing it on a worm-eaten table which, with a stepladder and the bed of goat skins, made up the entire furnishing of the cell.
115.070 Danglars asked for a knife and a fork.
115.071 "Here! Excellency," said Peppino, offering a small knife with a blunt point and a wooden fork.
115.072 Danglars took the knife in one hand, the fork in the other, and set about cutting up the bird.
115.073 "Excuse me, Excellency," said Peppino, laying a hand on the banker's shoulder; "here we pay before we eat; we might not be happy when we leave...
115.074 --Ah! ah!" said Danglars, "it's not like in Paris, not to mention that they'll probably skin me; but let's do things the hard way. Let us see, I have always heard of the cheapness of life in Italy; a chicken must be worth twelve sous in Rome.
115.075 "Here," he said, and threw a louis to Peppino.
115.076 Peppino picked up the louis, Danglars brought the knife near the chicken.
115.077 "One moment, Excellency," said Peppino, rising to his feet; "one moment, Your Excellency would like to see something again.
115.078 --When I said they would skin me!" murmured Danglars.
115.079 Then, resolved to take his side in this extortion:
115.080 "Let's see, how much do they pay you back for this etic poultry?" he asked.
115.081 --Your Excellency gave a louis as a down payment.
115.082 --A louis on account for a chicken?
115.083 --Surely, on account.
115.084 --Well... Come on! Come on!
115.085 --This is only four thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine louis that Your Excellency is giving me back."
115.086 Danglars opened enormous eyes at the statement of this gigantic joke.
115.087 "Ah, very funny," he murmured, "indeed."
115.088 And he wanted to go back to cutting up the chicken; but Peppino stopped his right hand with his left and held out his other hand.
115.089 "Come on," he said.
115.090 --What! you are not laughing?" said Danglars.
115.091 --We never laugh, Excellency," said Peppino, serious as a Quaker.
115.092 --How can you say, a hundred thousand francs for this chicken!
115.093 --Excellence, it's incredible how hard it is to raise poultry in these damned caves.
115.094 --All right! all right! said Danglars, I find it very buffoonish, very entertaining, indeed; but as I am hungry, let me eat. Here is another louis for you, my friend.
115.095 --Then it will be only four thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight louis, said Peppino, keeping the same composure; with patience, we will come to it.
115.096 --Oh! as for that, said Danglars, revolted at this perseverance in mocking him, as for that, never. Go to the devil! You don't know who you are dealing with."
115.097 Peppino made a sign, the young boy stretched out both hands and promptly removed the chicken. Danglars threw himself on his bed of goat skins, Peppino closed the door and went back to eating his peas with bacon.
115.098 Danglars could not see what Peppino was doing, but the chattering of the bandit's teeth should leave the prisoner in no doubt as to the exercise he was engaged in.
115.099 It was clear that he was eating, even eating noisily, and like an ill-bred man.
115.100 "Butor!" said Danglars.
115.101 Peppino pretended not to hear, and, without even turning his head, continued to eat with a wise slowness.
115.102 Danglars' stomach seemed to him to be pierced like the Danaides' barrel; he could not believe that he would ever manage to fill it.
115.103 However, he was patient for another half hour, but it is fair to say that this half hour seemed like a century.
115.104 He got up and went to the door again.
115.105 "Come on, sir," he said, "don't make me languish any longer, and tell me right away what they want from me?
115.106 --But, Excellency, rather say what you want from us... Give your orders and we will carry them out.
115.107 -Then open me first."
115.108 Peppino opened.
115.109 "I want," said Danglars, "by God, I want to eat!
115.110 --You are hungry?
115.111 --And you know it, besides.
115.112 --What does your Excellency wish to eat?
115.113 --A piece of dry bread, since the chickens are too expensive in these cursed cellars.
115.114 - Bread," said Peppino.
115.115 "Whoa! bread!" he shouted.
115.116 The young boy brought a bread roll.
115.117 "Here!" said Peppino.
115.118 --How much?" asked Danglars.
115.119 --Four thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight louis, there are two louis paid in advance.
115.120 --How, a loaf of bread, a hundred thousand francs?
115.121 --A hundred thousand francs, said Peppino.
115.122 --But you only asked for a hundred thousand francs for a chicken!
115.123 --We don't serve à la carte, but at a fixed price. Whether you eat little or a lot, whether you ask for ten dishes or just one, it's always the same number.
115.124 --This joke again! My dear friend, I tell you that this is absurd, that it is stupid! Tell me at once that you want me to die of hunger, it will be done sooner.
115.125 --But no, Excellency, it is you who want to kill yourself. Pay and eat.
115.126 --With what to pay, triple animal? said Danglars exasperated. Do you think one has a hundred thousand francs in one's pocket?
115.127 --You have five million and fifty thousand francs in yours, Excellency, said Peppino; that makes fifty chickens at one hundred thousand francs and half a chicken at fifty thousand."
115.128 Danglars shuddered; the blindfold fell from his eyes: it was indeed still a joke, but he understood it at last.
115.129 It is even fair to say that he no longer found it as flat as the moment before.
115.130 "Let's see," he said, "let's see: by giving these hundred thousand francs, will you at least hold me in contempt, and will I be able to eat at my ease?
115.131 - "No doubt," said Peppino.
115.132 -But how to give them?" said Danglars, breathing more freely.
115.133 --Nothing could be easier; you have a credit open with Messrs. Thomson and French, via dei Banchi, in Rome; give me a voucher of four thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight louis on these gentlemen, our banker will take it."
115.134 Danglars wanted at least to give himself the credit of good will; he took the pen and paper presented to him by Peppino, wrote the cedula, and signed.
115.135 "Here," he said, "is your bearer bond.
115.136 --And you, here is your chicken."
115.137 Danglars cut up the chicken with a sigh: it seemed to him very meager for such a large sum.
115.138 As for Peppino, he read the paper carefully, put it in his pocket, and continued to eat his chickpeas.
116.000 The pardon.
116.001 The next day Danglars was still hungry, the air in that cave was very appetizing; the prisoner thought that he would not have to spend any money that day: as a thrifty man he had hidden half his chicken and a piece of his bread in the corner of his cell.
116.002 But no sooner had he eaten than he was thirsty: he had not counted on that.
116.003 He struggled against his thirst until he felt his parched tongue clinging to his palate.
116.004 Then, unable to resist the fire that was devouring him, he called out.
116.005 The sentry opened the door; it was a new face.
116.006 He thought that it would be better for him to deal with an old acquaintance. He called Peppino.
116.007 "Here I am, Excellency," said the bandit, introducing himself with an eagerness that seemed to Danglars to be a good omen.
116.008 -- A drink, said the prisoner.
116.009 --Excellence, said Peppino, you know that wine is very expensive in the environs of Rome...
116.010 --Give me water then, said Danglars, trying to parry the boot.
116.011 --Oh! Excellency, water is rarer than wine; it is so dry!
116.012 --Come on, said Danglars, we are going to start again, it seems!"
116.013 And, while smiling to appear to be joking, the unfortunate man felt the sweat wet his temples.
116.014 "Let's see, my friend," said Danglars, seeing that Peppino remained impassive, "I ask you for a glass of wine; will you refuse me?
116.015 --I have already told you, Excellency," replied Peppino gravely, "that we do not sell retail.
116.016 -- Well, let's see then, give me a bottle.
116.017 --Which one?
116.018 --The cheapest one.
116.019 --They are both the same price.
116.020 --And what price?
116.021 -- Twenty-five thousand francs a bottle.
116.022 --Say, exclaimed Danglars with a bitterness that only Harpargon could have noted in the diapason of the human voice, say that you want to strip me, it will be sooner done than to devour me thus flap by flap.
116.023 -- It is possible, said Peppino, that this is the master's plan.
116.024 -The master, who is he then?
116.025 --The one to whom you were led the day before yesterday.
116.026 --And where is he?
116.027 -- Here.
116.028 --Please let me see him.
116.029 --That's easy."
116.030 The next moment Luigi Vampa was in front of Danglars.
116.031 "Are you calling me?" he asked the prisoner.
116.032 -Are you, sir, the leader of the people who brought me here?
116.033 --Yes, Excellency.
116.034 --What do you want from me for ransom? Speak up.
116.035 --But simply the five millions that you carry with you."
116.036 Danglars felt a frightful spasm crush his heart.
116.037 "That's all I have in the world, sir, and it's the rest of an immense fortune: if you take it away from me, take away my life.
116.038 -- We are forbidden to shed your blood, Excellency.
116.039 -- And by whom are you forbidden to do so?
116.040 -- By the one we obey.
116.041 --So you obey someone?
116.042 -- Yes, to a leader.
116.043 -- I thought you were the leader?
116.044 -- I am the leader of these men; but another man is my leader.
116.045 -- And does this leader obey anyone?
116.046 -- Yes.
116.047 --To whom?
116.048 -- To God."
116.049 Danglars remained a moment pensive.
116.050 "I don't understand you," he said.
116.051 --It is possible.
116.052 --And it was this chief who told you to treat me like this?
116.053 --Yes.
116.054 --What is his purpose?
116.055 --I don't know.
116.056 --But my purse will run out.
116.057 --That's likely.
116.058 -- Let's see, said Danglars, do you want a million?
116.059 --No.
116.060 --Two million?
116.061 --No.
116.062 --Three million?...four?... Let's see, four? I'll give it to you on condition that you let me go.
116.063 --Why are you offering us four million of what is worth five? says Vampa; that is usury, lord banker, or I don't know anything about it.
116.064 -Take it all! take it all, I tell you! cried Danglars, and kill me!
116.065 --Calm down, calm yourself, Excellency, you will whip your blood, which will give you an appetite to eat a million a day; so be more thrifty, damn you!
116.066 --But when I have no more money to pay you!
116.067 --Then you will be hungry.
116.068 --I'll be hungry?" said Danglars, blushing.
116.069 --That is probable, replied Vampa phlegmatically.
116.070 --But you say you don't want to kill me?
116.071 --No.
116.072 --And you want to let me starve to death?
116.073 --That's not the same thing.
116.074 --Well, wretches!" cried Danglars, "I will thwart your infamous calculations; to die for the sake of dying, I would rather get it over with right away; make me suffer, torture me, kill me, but you will no longer have my signature!
116.075 - "As you please, Excellency," said Vampa.
116.076 And he left the cell.
116.077 Danglars threw himself roaring on his goat skins.
116.078 What were these men? what was this invisible leader? what plans did they have for him? and when everyone else could redeem themselves, why couldn't he alone?
116.079 Certainly death, a quick and violent death, was a good way to deceive his bitter enemies, who seemed to be pursuing an incomprehensible revenge on him.
116.080 Yes, but to die!
116.081 For the first time perhaps in his long career, Danglars thought of death with the desire and the fear at the same time of dying; but the moment had come for him to stop his sight on the implacable specter which lives within every creature, which, at every pulse of the heart, says to itself: You will die!
116.082 Danglars resembled those wild beasts which the hunt animates, then despairs, and which, by dint of despair, sometimes succeed in saving themselves.
116.083 Danglars thought of an escape.
116.084 But the walls were the rock itself; but at the only exit that led out of the cell a man was reading, and behind this man one saw shadows armed with rifles pass and repass.
116.085 His resolution not to sign lasted two days, after which he asked for food and offered a million.
116.086 He was served a magnificent supper and his million was taken.
116.087 From then on, the life of the unfortunate prisoner was a perpetual raving. He had suffered so much that he no longer wanted to expose himself to suffering, and endured all the demands; at the end of twelve days, one afternoon when he had dined as in his best days of fortune, he made his accounts and realized that he had given so many treaties to the bearer, that he had only fifty thousand francs left.
116. 088 Then a strange reaction took place in him: he who had just given up five million, he tried to save the fifty thousand francs which remained to him, rather than give these fifty thousand francs, he resolved to resume a life of privations, he had glimmers of hope which touched on madness; he who for so long had forgotten God, he thought about it to tell himself that God sometimes had worked miracles: that the cave could fall; that the papal carabinieri could discover this cursed retreat and come to his rescue; that then he would have fifty thousand francs left; that fifty thousand francs was a sufficient sum to prevent a man from dying of hunger; he prayed to God to keep these fifty thousand francs for him, and as he prayed he wept.
116.089 Three days passed in this way, during which the name of God was constantly, if not in his heart, at least on his lips; at intervals he had moments of delirium during which he thought he saw, through the windows, an old man in a poor room dying on a bed.
116.090 This old man, too, was dying of hunger.
116.091 On the fourth day he was no longer a man, but a living corpse; he had picked up the last crumbs of his former meals from the ground and had begun to devour the mat that covered the floor.
116.092 Then he begged Peppino, as one begs his guardian angel, to give him some food; he offered him a thousand francs for a mouthful of bread.
116.093 Peppino did not answer.
116.094 On the fifth day he dragged himself to the entrance of the cell.
116.095 "But aren't you a Christian?" he said, rising to his knees; "you want to murder a man who is your brother before God?
116.096 "Oh, my friends of old, my friends of old," he murmured.
116.097 And he fell face down on the ground.
116.098 Then, getting up with a kind of despair
116.099 "The chief!" he shouted, "the chief!
116.100 -Here I am!" said Vampa, suddenly appearing, "What else do you want?
116.101 -Take my last gold, stammered Danglars, holding out his wallet, and let me live here, in this cave; I no longer ask for freedom, I only ask to live.
116.102 --Are you suffering well? asked Vampa.
116.103 --Oh, yes, I am suffering, and cruelly!
116.104 --There are men, however, who have suffered even more than you.
116.105 --I don't think so.
116.106 -So done! those who died of hunger."
116.107 Danglars thought of that old man whom, during his hours of hallucination, he saw, through the windows of his poor room, moaning on his bed.
116.108 He struck the ground with his forehead and groaned.
116.109 "Yes, it's true, there are some who have suffered even more than I have, but at least those were martyrs.
116.110 --Do you repent, at least?" said a dark and solemn voice, which made the hair on Danglars' head stand up.
116.111 His weakened gaze tried to distinguish objects, and he saw behind the bandit a man wrapped in a cloak and lost in the shadow of a stone pilaster.
116.112 "For what must I repent?" stammered Danglars.
116.113 --For the evil you have done, said the same voice.
116.114 --Oh! yes, I repent! I repent!" cried Danglars.
116.115 And he struck his chest with his thin fist.
116.116 "Then I forgive you," said the man, throwing off his cloak and taking a step to stand in the light.
116.117 --The Count of Monte Cristo!" said Danglars, paler with terror than he had been, a moment before, with hunger and misery.
116.118 --You are mistaken; I am not the Count of Monte Cristo.
116.119 --And who are you then?
116.120 --I am the one you sold, handed over, dishonored: I am the one whose fiancée you prostituted; I am the one you stepped on to raise yourself to fortune; I am the one whose father you made die of hunger, who had condemned you to die of hunger, and who nevertheless forgives you, because he himself needs to be forgiven: I am Edmond Dantes!"
116.121 Danglars only uttered a cry, and fell prostrate.
116.122 "Get up," said the Count, "you have your life saved; similar fortune has not befallen your two other accomplices: one is mad, the other is dead! Keep the fifty thousand francs you have left, I will give them to you; as for your five million stolen from the hospices, they have already been returned to them by an unknown hand.
116.123 "And now eat and drink; tonight I make you my guest.
116.124 "Vampa, when this man is sated, he will be free."
116.125 Danglars remained prostrate while the Count went away; when he raised his head, he saw only a kind of shadow that disappeared into the corridor, and before which the bandits bowed.
116.126 As the Count had ordered, Danglars was served by Vampa, who had the best wine and the most beautiful fruits of Italy brought to him, and who, having made him get into his post-chair, left him on the road, leaning against a tree.
116.127 He stayed there until daylight, not knowing where he was.
116.128 When daylight came, he saw that he was near a brook: he was thirsty, so he dragged himself to it.
116.129 When he stooped down to drink from it, he saw that his hair had turned white.
117.000 October 5.
117.001 It was about six o'clock in the evening, an opal-colored day, in which a beautiful autumn sun infiltrated its golden rays, fell from the sky onto the bluish sea.
117.002 The heat of the day had gradually died down, and one began to feel that light breeze which seems the breath of nature waking up after the burning siesta of the noon, a delicious breath which refreshes the coasts of the Mediterranean and which carries from shore to shore the perfume of the trees, mingled with the pungent scent of the sea.
117.003 On this immense lake which extends from Gibraltar to the Dardanelles and from Tunis to Venice, a light yacht, pure and elegant of form, glided in the first vapors of the evening. Its movement was that of a swan that opens its wings to the wind and seems to glide on the water. It moved forward, fast and graceful at the same time, and left behind it a phosphorescent furrow.
117.004 Little by little the sun, whose last rays we greeted, had disappeared on the western horizon; but, as if to give reason to the brilliant dreams of mythology, its indiscreet fires, reappearing at the top of each wave, seemed to reveal that the god of flame had just hidden in the bosom of Amphitrite, who tried in vain to hide her lover in the folds of her azure coat.
117.005 The yacht was moving fast, although there was hardly enough wind to float the curly hair of a young girl.
117.006 Standing on the bow, a tall man with a bronze complexion and a dilated eye saw the land coming to him in the form of a dark cone-shaped mass, emerging from the waves like a huge Catalan hat.
117.007 "Is this Monte Cristo?" asked the traveler, to whose orders the little yacht seemed to be momentarily subject, in a low voice marked by deep sadness.
117.008 --Yes, Excellency," replied the skipper, "we are coming.
117.009 --We are coming!" murmured the traveler with an indefinable accent of melancholy.
117.010 Then he added in a low voice:
117.011 "Yes, this will be the port."
117.012 And he fell back into his thought, which was expressed in a smile sadder than tears would have been.
117.013 A few minutes later the glow of a flame was seen on land, which was immediately extinguished, and the sound of a gun came to the yacht.
117.014 "Your Excellency," said the skipper, "here is the signal from the shore, do you want to answer it yourself?
117.015 --What signal?
117.016 The skipper stretched out his hand towards the island, from whose flanks a large flake of smoke was rising, isolated and whitish, which was tearing itself apart as it widened.
117.017 "Ah, yes," he said, as if emerging from a dream, "give."
117.018 The boss handed him a fully loaded rifle, the traveler took it, raised it slowly and fired it into the air.
117.019 Ten minutes later the sails were furled, and the anchor was dropped five hundred paces from a small port.
117.020 The boat was already in the water with four rowers and the pilot; the traveler got out and instead of sitting at the stern, which was covered with a blue carpet, stood with his arms crossed.
117.021 The rowers waited, their oars half raised, like birds drying their wings.
117.022 "Go!" said the traveler.
117.023 The eight oars fell back into the sea at once and without spouting a drop of water; then the boat, yielding to the impulse, slid rapidly.
117.024 In an instant one was in a small cove formed by a natural indentation, the boat touched on a bottom of fine sand.
117.025 "Excellency," said the pilot, "get on the shoulders of two of our men, they will carry you ashore."
117.026 The young man responded to this invitation with a gesture of complete indifference, released his legs from the boat and let himself slide into the water, which rose up to his waist.
117.027 "Ah, Excellency," murmured the pilot, "it is wrong what you are doing here, and you will have us scolded by the master."
117.028 The young man continued to move toward the shore, following two sailors who were choosing the best bottom.
117.029 After about thirty paces they had landed; the young man shook his feet on dry ground, and looked around for the probable path that was to be shown him, for it was quite dark.
117.030 Just as he turned his head, a hand came to rest on his shoulder, and a voice made him jump.
117.031 "Hello, Maximilian," said the voice, "you are correct, thank you!
117.032 -It is you, Count," cried the young man with a movement that resembled joy, and shaking Monte Cristo's hand with both hands.
117.033 --Yes, you see, as exact as you; but you are dripping, my dear friend: you must change, as Calypso would say to Telemachus. Come then, there is a dwelling all prepared for you, in which you will forget fatigue and cold."
117.034 Monte Cristo saw that Morrel was turning around; he waited.
117.035 The young man, indeed, saw with surprise that not a word had been spoken by those who had brought him, that he had not paid them, and yet they had gone. One could even hear the beating of the oars of the boat as it returned to the little yacht.
117.036 "Ah, yes," said the Count, "you are looking for your sailors?
117.037 -- No doubt I gave them nothing, and yet they left.
117.038 --Don't worry about that, Maximilian," said Monte Cristo, laughing, "I have a contract with the navy to ensure that the access to my island is free of all cartage and travel rights. I am a subscriber, as they say in civilized countries."
117.039 Morrel looked at the count in astonishment.
117.040 "Count," he said to him, "you are not the same as you were in Paris.
117.041 --How so?
117.042 --Yes, here you laugh."
117.043 Monte Cristo's forehead suddenly darkened.
117.044 "You are right to remind me of myself, Maximilian," he said, "seeing you again was a happiness for me, and I had forgotten that all happiness is fleeting.
117.045 --Oh, no, no, Count!" cried Morrel, seizing his friend's two hands again; "laugh, on the contrary, be happy, you, and prove to me by your indifference that life is bad only to those who suffer. Oh, you are charitable, you are good, you are great, my friend, and it is to give me courage that you are so cheerful.
117.046 -- "You are mistaken, Morrel," said Monte Cristo, "it is that I was indeed happy.
117.047 --So you forget me; so much the better!
117.048 --How so?
117.049 -- Yes, because you know, friend, as the gladiator entering the circus said to the sublime emperor, I say to you: "He who is going to die salutes you."
117.050 --Are you not consoled?" asked Monte Cristo with a strange look.
117.051 --Oh!" said Morrel with a look full of bitterness, "did you really believe that I could be?
117.052 --Listen," said the Count, "you hear my words well, don't you, Maximilian? You don't take me for a vulgar man, for a rattle that emits vague and empty sounds. When I ask you if you are consoled, I speak to you as a man for whom the human heart has no more secrets. Well, Morrel, let's go down together to the bottom of your heart and probe it. Is it still this fiery impatience of pain which makes the body jump like the lion bitten by the mosquito? Is it still this devouring thirst that is only extinguished in the grave? Is it that ideality of regret that throws the living out of life in pursuit of the dead? Or is it only the prostration of exhausted courage, the boredom that stifles the ray of hope that would like to shine? is it the loss of memory, bringing the impotence of tears? Oh, my dear friend, if this is it, if you can no longer cry, if you believe your numb heart is dead, if you have no strength but in God, no eyes but for heaven, friend, let us leave aside words too narrow for the meaning our soul gives them. Maximilian, you are comforted, do not complain any more.
117.053 --Count, said Morrel in his soft and firm voice at the same time; Count, listen to me, as one listens to a man who speaks with his finger stretched out towards the earth, his eyes raised to heaven: I have come to you to die in the arms of a friend. Certainly, there are people whom I love: I love my sister Julie, I love her husband Emmanuel; but I need someone to open strong arms to me and to smile at me in my last moments; my sister would burst into tears and faint; I would see her suffer, and I have suffered enough; Emmanuel would tear the weapon out of my hands and fill the house with his cries. You, Count, whose word I have, you who are more than a man, you whom I would call a god if you were not mortal, you, you will lead me gently and tenderly, will you not, to the gates of death?
117.054 --Amigo, said the Count, I still have a doubt: would you have so little strength that you would be proud to show your pain?
117.055 -- No, see, I am simple, said Morrel, holding out his hand to the Count, and my pulse beats neither stronger nor slower than usual. No, I feel I am at the end of the road; no, I will go no further. You spoke to me of waiting and hoping; do you know what you have done, unfortunate sage that you are? I waited a month, that is to say that I suffered a month! I hoped (man is a poor and miserable creature), I hoped for what? I don't know, for something unknown, absurd, senseless! God alone can say it, He who has mixed with our reason this madness that we call hope. Yes, I have waited; yes, I have hoped, Count, and for a quarter of an hour that we have been talking you have broken and tortured my heart a hundred times without knowing it, because each of your words has proved to me that there is no hope for me. O count! how sweetly and voluptuously I shall rest in death!"
117.056 Morrel pronounced these last words with an explosion of energy that made the count flinch.
117.057 "My friend," continued Morrel, seeing that the Count was silent, "you have designated the 5th of October as the term of the reprieve you asked of me... my friend, today is the 5th of October..."
117.058 Morrel pulled out his watch.
117.059 "It is nine o'clock, I have three hours to live.
117.060 -So, Monte Cristo replied, come."
117.061 Morrel followed the Count mechanically, and they were already in the cave that Maximilian had not yet noticed.
117.062 He found carpets under his feet, a door opened, perfumes enveloped him, a bright light struck his eyes.
117.063 Morrel stopped, hesitating to go forward; he was wary of the enervating delights that surrounded him.
117.064 Monte Cristo drew him gently forward.
117.065 "Is it not fitting," he said, "that we should employ the three hours that remain to us like those ancient Romans who, condemned by Nero, their emperor and heir, sat at table crowned with flowers, and breathed in death with the perfume of heliotropes and roses?"
117.066 Morrel smiled.
117.067 "As you wish," he said; "death is always death, that is to say, oblivion, that is to say, rest, that is to say, the absence of life and consequently of pain."
117.068 He sat down, Monte Cristo took his seat opposite him.
117.069 They were in that marvelous dining room which we have already described, and where marble statues carried on their heads baskets always full of flowers and fruit.
117.070 Morrel had looked at everything vaguely, and it was probable that he had seen nothing.
117.071 "Let's talk like men," he said, staring at the Count.
117.072 --Speak," said the latter.
117.073 --Count, Morrel continued, you are the summary of all human knowledge, and you give me the impression of having come down from a world more advanced and more learned than ours.
117.074 --There is something true in that, Morrel," said the Count with that melancholy smile which made him so beautiful; "I have descended from a planet called pain.
117.075 -- I believe everything you tell me without seeking to investigate its meaning, Count; and the proof is that you told me to live, that I have lived; it is that you told me to hope, and that I have almost hoped. I will therefore dare to say to you, Count, as if you had already died once: Count, does it hurt much?"
117.076 Monte Cristo looked at Morrel with an indefinable expression of tenderness.
117.077 "Yes," he said, "yes, without a doubt, it hurts a lot, if you brutally break this mortal envelope which obstinately asks to live. If you make your flesh cry out under the imperceptible teeth of a dagger; if you pierce with an unintelligent bullet, always ready to stray in its path, your brain that the least shock hurts, certainly, you will suffer, and you will leave life odiously, finding it, in the midst of your desperate agony, better than a rest so dearly bought.
117.078 --Yes, I understand, said Morrel, death as well as life has its secrets of pain and pleasure: the thing is to know them.
117.079 -- Rightly, Maximilian, and you have just said the big word. Death is, according to the care we take to put ourselves right or wrong with it, either a friend who cradles us as gently as a nurse, or an enemy who violently tears our soul from our body. One day, when our world will have lived another thousand years, when we will have made ourselves masters of all the destructive forces of nature in order to make them serve the general welfare of mankind; when man will know, as you said just now, the secrets of death, death will become as sweet and as voluptuous as the sleep enjoyed in the arms of our beloved.
117.080 --And if you wanted to die, Count, would you know how to die like that?
117.081 --Yes."
117.082 Morrel held out his hand.
117.083 "I understand now," he said, "why you have given me an appointment here, on this desolate island in the middle of an ocean, in this underground sepulchral palace that would make a Pharaoh envious: it is because you love me, isn't it, Count? it is because you love me enough to give me one of those deaths of which you spoke to me just now, a death without agony, a death that will allow me to pass away pronouncing the name of Valentine and shaking your hand?
117.084 --Yes, you have guessed right, Morrel, said the Count with simplicity, and that is how I understand it.
117.085 --Thank you; the idea that tomorrow I will suffer no more is sweet to my poor heart.
117.086 -- Do you regret nothing?" asked Monte Cristo.
117.087 -- No, replied Morrel.
117.088 --Not even me?" asked the Count with deep emotion.
117.089 Morrel stopped, his pure eye suddenly dimmed, then shone with an unusual brilliance; a large tear burst from it and rolled down a silver furrow on his cheek.
117.090 "What!" said the Count, "you have one regret left of the earth and you die!
117.091 --Oh, I beg you," cried Morrel in a weakened voice, "not another word, Count, do not prolong my torture!"
117.092 The count believed that Morrel was weakening.
117.093 This instantaneous belief resurrected in him the horrible doubt that had already been overcome once in the Château d'If.
117.094 "I am concerned," he thought, "with restoring this man to happiness; I look upon this restitution as a weight thrown into the scales opposite the pan on which I have let the evil fall. Now, if I were mistaken, if this man were not unfortunate enough to deserve happiness! alas! what would happen to me, who can only forget the evil by recalling the good?
117.095 "Listen! Morrel," he said, "your pain is immense, I see it; but nevertheless you believe in God, and you do not want to risk the salvation of your soul."
117.096 Morrel smiled sadly.
117.097 "Count," he said, "you know I don't do poetry cold; but, I swear to you, my soul is no longer mine.
117.098 --Listen, Morrel," said Monte Cristo, "I have no relatives in the world, you know that. I have accustomed myself to look upon you as my son; well, to save my son, I would sacrifice my life, much more so my fortune.
117.099 -- What do you mean?
117.100 -- I mean, Morrel, that you want to leave life, because you don't know all the pleasures that life allows a great fortune. Morrel, I have nearly a hundred millions, I give them to you; with such a fortune you can achieve all the results you propose. Are you ambitious? All careers will be open to you. Stir up the world, change its face, indulge in foolish practices, be criminal if you must, but live.
117.101 --Count, I have your word, Morrel replied coldly; and, he added, pulling out his watch, it is half past eleven.
117.102 --Morrel! Are you thinking of that, under my eyes, in my house?
117.103 - "Then let me go," said Maximilian, who had become gloomy, "or I shall think that you do not love me for myself, but for yourself.
117.104 And he rose to his feet.
117.105 "It is well," said Monte Cristo, whose face brightened at these words; "you want it, Morrel, and you are inflexible; yes! you are profoundly unhappy, and you have said it, a miracle alone could cure you; sit down, Morrel, and wait."
117.106 Morrel obeyed. Monte Cristo rose in his turn and went to fetch from a carefully locked cupboard, the key to which he carried suspended on a gold chain, a small silver box marvelously carved and chiseled, the corners of which represented four arched figures, similar to those caryatids with desolate outbursts, figures of women, symbols of angels who aspire to heaven.
117.107 He placed the box on the table.
117.108 Then he opened it and took out a small golden box, the lid of which was lifted by the pressure of a secret spring. This box contained a creamy, semi-solid substance whose color was indefinable, thanks to the reflection of the polished gold, sapphires, rubies, and emeralds that lined the box. It was like a shimmer of azure, purple and gold.
117.109 The Count drew a small quantity of this substance with a vermeil spoon, and offered it to Morrel with a long look.
117.110 It was then possible to see that the substance was greenish.
117.111 "This is what you asked me for," he said. This is what I promised you.
117.112 --Living still," said the young man, taking the spoon from Monte Cristo's hands, "I thank you from the bottom of my heart."
117.113 The Count took a second spoon, and drew a second time from the golden box.
117.114 "What are you going to do, friend?" asked Morrel, stopping his hand.
117.115 "My goodness, Morrel," he said, smiling, "I think, God forgive me, that I am as tired of life as you are, and since the opportunity presents itself...
117.116 --Stop! cried the young man, oh, you who love, you who are loved, you who have the faith of hope, oh, do not do what I am going to do; on your part it would be a crime. Farewell, my noble and generous friend, I will tell Valentine all that you have done for me."
117.117 And slowly, without any hesitation than a pressure of the left hand which he held out to the Count, Morrel swallowed, or rather savored the mysterious substance offered by Monte Cristo.
117.118 Then they both fell silent. Ali, silent and attentive, brought in the tobacco and hookahs, served the coffee and disappeared.
117.119 Little by little the lamps faded in the hands of the marble statues that supported them, and the perfume of the cassolettes seemed less penetrating to Morrel.
117.120 Sitting opposite him, Monte Cristo looked at him from the depths of the shadow, and Morrel saw only the Count's eyes shining.
117.121 An immense pain seized the young man; he felt the hookah slipping from his hands; objects were insensibly losing their shape and color; his troubled eyes saw doors and curtains opening in the wall.
117.122 "Friend," he said, "I feel that I am dying, thank you."
117.123 He made an effort to hold out his hand one last time, but his hand without strength fell back beside him.
117.124 Then it seemed to him that Monte Cristo was smiling, no longer with his strange and frightening laughter which had several times given him a glimpse of the mysteries of that deep soul, but with the benevolent compassion which fathers have for their little children who are unreasonable.
117.125 At the same time the Count grew in his eyes; his height, almost doubled, was outlined on the red hangings, he had thrown back his black hair, and he appeared upright and proud like one of those angels with which the wicked are threatened on the day of the last judgment.
117.126 Morrel, dejected, tamed, fell back in his chair: a velvety torpor crept into each of his veins. A change of ideas furnished his forehead, so to speak, like a new arrangement of drawings in a kaleidoscope.
117.127 Lying down, exhausted, panting, Morrel felt nothing more alive in him than this dream: it seemed to him as if he were entering with full sail into the vague delirium which precedes that other unknown which is called death.
117.128 He tried once more to hold out his hand to the Count, but this time his hand did not even move; he wanted to articulate a supreme farewell, his tongue rolled heavily down his throat like a stone that would block a tomb.
117.129 His eyes, full of longing, closed in spite of himself, but behind his eyelids an image was stirring which he recognized in spite of the darkness with which he thought he was wrapped.
117.130 It was the Count who had just opened the door.
117.131 Immediately an immense light shone from a neighboring room, or rather from a marvelous palace, and flooded the room where Morrel was in sweet agony.
117.132 Then he saw a woman of marvelous beauty coming to the threshold of this room, and on the border of the two chambers.
117.133 Pale and softly smiling, she seemed the angel of mercy conjuring the angel of vengeance.
117.134 "Is it already heaven that is opening for me?" thought the dying man; "this angel looks like the one I have lost."
117.135 Monte Cristo pointed to the sofa where Morrel lay.
117.136 She came towards him with her hands clasped and a smile on her lips.
117.137 "Valentine! Valentine!" cried Morrel from the bottom of his soul.
117.138 But his mouth did not utter a sound; and as if all his strength were united in this inner emotion, he sighed and closed his eyes.
117.139 Valentine rushed toward him.
117.140 Morrel's lips made another movement.
117.141 "He is calling you," said the Count; "he is calling you from his sleep, the one to whom you entrusted your destiny, and death wanted to separate you: but I was there by chance, and I defeated death! Valentine, from now on you must not separate on earth; for, to find you, he would rush into the grave. Without me you would both die, I give you back to each other: may God account to me for these two existences which I save!"
117.142 Valentine seized Monte Cristo's hand, and in a burst of irresistible joy she brought it to her lips.
117.143 "Oh, thank me," said the Count, "tell me again, without tiring of telling me again, tell me again that I have made you happy!
117.144 --Oh, yes, yes, I thank you with all my soul, said Valentine, and if you doubt that my thanks are sincere, well, ask Haydée, ask my beloved sister Haydée, who since our departure from France has made me wait patiently, by telling me about you, for the happy day that is now shining for me.
117.145 --So you love Haydée?" asked Monte Cristo with an emotion which he tried in vain to conceal.
117.146 --Oh, with all my soul.
117.147 --Well, listen, Valentine, said the Count, I have a favor to ask of you.
117.148 --To me, great God! Am I happy enough for this?
117.149 --Yes, you called Haydée your sister: let her be your sister indeed, Valentine; give her back all that you think you owe me; protect her, Morrel and yourself, for (the Count's voice was ready to die out in his throat), for from now on she will be alone in the world...
117.150 --Alone in the world!" repeated a voice behind the Count, "and why?
117.151 Monte Cristo turned around.
117.152 Haydée was standing there, pale and frozen, looking at the Count with a gesture of mortal stupor.
117.153 "Because tomorrow, my daughter, you will be free," answered the Count; "because you will take back in the world the place that is due to you, because I do not want my destiny to obscure yours. Daughter of a prince! I give you back your father's wealth and name."
117.154 Haydee paled, opened her diaphanous hands as does the virgin who commends herself to God, and in a voice hoarse with tears:
117.155 "So, my lord, you are leaving me?" she said.
117.156 --Haydee! Haydee! You are young, you are beautiful; forget my name and be happy.
117.157 -It is well, says Haydée, your orders will be carried out, my lord; I will forget even your name and I will be happy."
117.158 And she took a step back to withdraw.
117.159 "Oh, my God!" cried Valentine, while supporting Morrel's numb head on her shoulder, "don't you see how pale she is, don't you understand what she is suffering?"
117.160 Haydée said to him with a heartrending expression:
117.161 "Why do you want him to understand me, sister? He is my master and I am his slave, he has the right to see nothing."
117.162 The Count shuddered at the accents of this voice, which went to awaken even the most secret fibers of his heart; his eyes met those of the girl and could not bear the glare.
117.163 "My God! my God!" said Monte Cristo, "what you let me suspect would be true! Haydée, would you be happy not to leave me?
117.164 -- I am young," she answered gently, "I love the life you have always made so sweet for me, and I would be sorry to die.
117.165 --Does that mean that if I left you, Haydée...
117.166 --I would die, my lord, yes!
117.167 --But do you love me?
117.168 --Oh! Valentine, he asks if I love him! Valentine, tell him if you love Maximilian!"
117.169 The Count felt his chest expand and his heart dilate; he opened his arms, Haydée leaped into them with a cry.
117.170 "Oh, yes, I love you!" she said, "I love you as one loves one's father, one's brother, one's husband! I love you as one loves one's life, as one loves one's God, for you are for me the most beautiful, the best and the greatest of all created beings!
117.171 -- So let it be done as you wish, my dear angel! said the Count; God, who raised me up against my enemies and made me victorious, God, I see, does not want to put this repentance at the end of my victory; I wanted to punish myself, God wants to forgive me. Love me then, Haydée! Who knows? Perhaps your love will make me forget what I must forget.
117.172 --But what are you saying, my lord?
117.173 -- I am saying that one word from you, Haydée, has enlightened me more than twenty years of my slow wisdom; I have only you left in the world, Haydée; through you I am attached to life, through you I can suffer, through you I can be happy.
117.174 -Do you hear him, Valentine?" cried Haydée; "he says that through me he can suffer! through me, who would give my life for him!"
117.175 The Count paused for a moment.
117.176 "Have I glimpsed the truth?" he said, "O God! Come, Haydee, come..."
117.177 And throwing his arm around the girl's waist, he shook hands with Valentine and disappeared.
117.178 An hour or so passed, during which time Valentine remained near Morrel, panting, speechless, and staring. At last she felt her heart beat, an imperceptible breath opened her lips, and that slight shiver which announces the return of life ran through the young man's whole body.
117.179 At last her eyes opened again, but fixed and as if senseless at first; then sight returned to her, precise, real; with sight came feeling, with feeling pain.
117.180 "Oh!" he cried with the accent of despair, "I still live! the Count has deceived me!"
117.181 And his hand reached out to the table, and seized a knife.
117.182 "Friend," said Valentine with his adorable smile, "wake up and look my way."
117.183 Morrel gave a great cry, and delirious, full of doubt, dazzled as if by a heavenly vision, he fell on his two knees...
117.184 The next day, with the first rays of daylight, Morrel and Valentine were walking on each other's arms along the shore, Valentine telling Morrel how Monte Cristo had appeared in her room, how he had revealed everything to her, how he had made her touch the crime with his finger, and finally how he had miraculously saved her from death, all the while allowing her to believe she was dead.
117.185 They found the door of the cave open and went out; the sky showed the last stars of the night in its morning blue.
117.186 Then Morrel saw in the half-light of a group of rocks a man who was waiting for a sign to go forward; he showed this man to Valentine.
117.187 "Ah, that's Jacopo," she said, "the captain of the yacht."
117.188 And with a gesture she called him to her and to Maximilian.
117.189 "You have something to tell us?" asked Morrel.
117.190 --I had to give you this letter from the Count.
117.191 --From the Count!" murmured the two young men together.
117.192 --Yes, read."
117.193 Morrel opened the letter and read:
117.194 "My dear Maximilian,
117.195 "There is a felucca for you at anchor. Jacopo will take you to Livorno, where M. Noirtier is waiting for his granddaughter, whom he wants to bless before she follows you to the altar. Everything in this cave, my friend, my house on the Champs-Élysées and my little château in Le Tréport are Edmond Dantès' wedding present to the son of his boss Morrel. Mlle de Villefort will take half of it, for I beg her to give to the poor of Paris all the fortune that belongs to her on the side of her father, who has gone mad, and on the side of her brother, who died last September with his mother-in-law.
117.196 "Tell the angel who will watch over your life, Morrel, to pray sometimes for a man who, like Satan, thought himself for a moment the equal of God, and who recognized, with all the humility of a Christian, that in the hands of God alone are supreme power and infinite wisdom. Perhaps these prayers will soften the remorse he carries in his heart.
117.197 "As for you, Morrel, here is the whole secret of my conduct towards you: there is neither happiness nor misfortune in this world, there is the comparison of one state with another, that is all. Only he who has experienced extreme misfortune is fit to feel extreme happiness. You must have wanted to die, Maximilian, to know how good it is to live.
117.198 "Live, then, and be happy, beloved children of my heart, and never forget that, until the day when God deigns to reveal the future to man, all human wisdom will be in these two words:
117.199 "Wait and hope!
117.200 "Your friend.
117.201 "EDMOND DANTES
117.202 "_Comte de MONTE-CRISTO_."
117.203 While reading this letter, which told her of her father's folly and her brother's death, a death and folly of which she was ignorant, Valentine paled, a painful sigh escaped from her breast, and tears, which were no less poignant for being silent, rolled down her cheeks; her happiness was costing her dearly.
117.204 Morrel looked around him with concern.
117.205 "But," he said, "in truth the Count exaggerates his generosity; Valentine will be satisfied with my modest fortune. Where is the Count, my friend? Take me to him."
117.206 Jacopo stretched out his hand toward the horizon.
117.207 "What do you mean?" asked Valentine. Where is the Count? Where is Haydée?
117.208 -Look," said Jacopo.
117.209 The eyes of the two young men fixed themselves on the line indicated by the sailor, and on the dark blue line that separated the sky from the Mediterranean on the horizon they saw a white sail, as large as a gull's wing.
117.210 "Gone!" cried Morrel; "gone! Farewell, my friend, my father!
117.211 --Gone!" murmured Valentine. Farewell, my friend! Farewell, my sister!
117.212 --Who knows if we shall ever see them again?
117.213 -My friend, said Valentine, has not the Count just told us that human wisdom was all in these two words:
117.214 "_Expect and hope_!"
